Episode 1x01 Pilot (1/2)

1986, Santa Barbara, California

INT. DINER, DAY

A young boy of around 9 years old, SHAWN, sits across from his father, HENRY in a booth. HENRY is in his police

uniform.

HENRY:
Did you do your homework?

SHAWN:
Unh-huh.

HENRY:
Finish those beets?

SHAWN:
Yep. (looks at dessert tray) Can I have the fudge cake?

HENRY:
Close your eyes.

SHAWN:
Dad, I don't want to...

HENRY:
Now.

With a sigh, SHAWN closes his eyes and puts his fingers to each temple.

HENRY:
Which letter is out in the exit sign?

SHAWN:
The X.

HENRY:
What the color is the vinyl?

SHAWN:
What's vinyl?

HENRY:
It's the stuff these seats are covered in.

SHAWN:
Purple.

HENRY:
Maroon. Close enough. Manager's name.

SHAWN:
Who?

HENRY:
She's wearing a name tag. The woman standing at the front door when we first walked in. You saw her.

Shawn *flashes* to when they walked in and sees the nametag.*

SHAWN:
Marie. Can I have the cake now?

HENRY:
(leans forward) How many hats?

SHAWN:
(frustrated) Come on, dad!

HENRY:
Shawn, you want a piece of cake? How many hats are in the room?

SHAWN:
(flashes on hats) Does a beanie count?

HENRY:
What do you think?

SHAWN:
Three.

HENRY:
You didn't describe them.

SHAWN:
That's not fair.

HENRY:
Time's almost up, Shawn.

SHAWN:
One has a flower... the one the lady's wearing. One has a picture of some kind of lion on the weird guy with the crooked tooth. The last one is...on the chef.

HENRY:
What about the beanie?

SHAWN:
A beanie's a cap, not a hat.

HENRY:
All right, open your eyes.

SHAWN:
Thank you. (opens eyes)

A WAITRESS witnesses HENRY'S "exercise".

WAITRESS:
Wow. That's amazing.

SHAWN smiles.

HENRY:
It's adequate.

SHAWN'S smile fades.

HENRY:
Get him his cake.

WAITRESS:
I guess I know what you're going to be when you grow up.

SHAWN:
Oh, I'm never gonna grow up, ma'am.

2006...Still Santa Barbara

INT. SHAWN'S APARTMENT, NIGHT

SHAWN is making out with a WOMAN and is barely able to set down his motorcycle helmet. She pulls off his flannel shirt.

WOMAN:
Nice place.

SHAWN:
Thank you.

She pushes him against the back of the couch. His hand falls on the remote control, turning on the TV and the weather report. The WOMAN pushes SHAWN down onto the couch and loosens her hair.

WOMAN:
I knew you were gonna be my best table.

SHAWN moans as she climbs on his lap and starts kissing him. SHAWN becomes distracted by the news report.

FEMALE REPORTER:
Joe, do the police have any leads at this time?

JOE:
We're at a loss. We really don't know what else to do. Been a tough few weeks. Basically run out of ideas. Hopefully the police will be able to crack this one for us.

SHAWN flashes on JOE'S fidgeting hands and wandering eyes.

FEMALE REPORTER:
Closing the books on the visions break-ins could be just the olive branch needed to set things in the right direction.

SHAWN reaches for his phone.

WOMAN:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
I'm calling the police.

WOMAN:
Any particular reason?

SHAWN:
I think I just closed a case.

WOMAN:
You didn't tell me you're a cop.

SHAWN:
Oh, no, no, no. Definitely not a cop. Does that disappoint you?

WOMAN:
I just thought you might have handcuffs.

SHAWN:
Oh, I have handcuffs. (into phone) Hello.

OFFICER:
(over phone) Santa Barbara police department.

SHAWN:
(into phone) Uh, it's the store manager. He did it.

OFFICER:
(over phone) Pardon me?

SHAWN:
(into phone) Uh, the stereo robberies. At the visions chain store. He's on channel 8 news right now. Uh, his hands. Nervous tic... dead giveaway. And he won't look at the reporter in the eyes. My name? My name is Shawn... Spencer.

OFFICER:
(over phone) And is there anything else today?

SHAWN:
(into phone) No. That's gonna do it. Actually, the tags on the news van have expired. But that's completely unrelated.

SHAWN hangs up the phone and turns the tables on the WOMAN.

EXT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, DAY

SHAWN gets off his Norton motorcycle, removes helmet and heads inside.

INT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, FRONT DESK, DAY

SHAWN walks over to the desk where a black female officer, ALLEN, is on the phone.

SHAWN:
Hello, officer.

ALLEN: (into phone)
But you gotta go. It was awesome. Well, yeah.

SHAWN sees the talisman, crystals and dreamcatchers scattered around ALLEN'S area.

ALLEN: (into phone)
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Hi.

ALLEN: (into phone)
It was amazing.

SHAWN:
I'm Shawn Spencer.

Without even looking at him, ALLEN points to a bench where a large MAN sits in handcuffs, chained to the bench.

ALLEN: (into phone)
And the other thing is... well, no, I'm not going to pay for it.

SHAWN:
Oh... oh no, no. No, that's not for me. Uh, I'm here for a commendation. I called in a... tip.

ALLEN points again.

ALLEN: (into phone)
Oh, no, Michelle, I can't pay for that.

SHAWN:
Here's the thing, these are new pants.

ALLEN points again.

SHAWN:
Clearly you feel very strongly about this. Right.

SHAWN walks over to the bench and sits on the opposite end from the other man. He smiles as he listens to ALLEN'S conversation.

ALLEN: (into phone)
$80 is a lot for a reading, but she was astounding. I mean, she knew about granny's childhood and the curios she left Bobby. I mean, I could literally feel her spirit in the room.

SHAWN looks at the MAN on the bench, peering to get a look at his face. The MAN turns around and SHAWN can see the tattoo of "Bloodthirsty" on his forehead as well as the tear under his left eye.

SHAWN:
Get out of here. You know, I have the same tattoo. They spelled "bloodthirsty" wrong on mine. Can you believe it?

The MAN lunges at SHAWN but can't reach him due to chain.

SHAWN:
I cannot believe you didn't test that out first.

The door to the copy room opens and inside SHAWN sees a tall, young officer, McNAB, counting to himself as he practices dance steps. His eyes then return to the MAN and he sees pieces of taillight in the folds of the MAN'S sleeve.

SHAWN:
What'd you do, bust up your ex-wife's car?

MAN:
Her new boyfriend'S.

SHAWN:
That'll teach her.

MAN:
They got no witnesses.

SHAWN:
Sweet. Might want to brush the shards of taillight off your sleeve. Just a tip.

MAN:
Gee, thanks, guy.

SHAWN:
Sure.

The MAN brushes his sleeve, but some of the shards fall into his boot. SHAWN thinks about telling him, but doesn't.

INT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, HALL, DAY

SHAWN is escorted down the hall by McNAB.

McNAB:
Right this way, Mr. Spencer.

SHAWN:
So when do I get my money?

A female detective, LUCINDA, is waiting at the interrogation room door.

LUCINDA:
Money?

SHAWN:
Yeah. The reward.

INT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

SHAWN looks at LUCINDA and her partner, CARLTON LASSITER.

SHAWN:
You guys arrested the store manager. Am I right?

LASSITER:
Why don't you let us ask the questions for awhile.

SHAWN:
Okay. (sits)

In the reflection of the two-way mirror, SHAWN sees LASSITER touch LUCINDA'S hair as he passes behind her.

SHAWN:
So which questions might those be?

LASSITER:
Ooh, I don't know. Like where were you the night of the last robbery?

SHAWN:
I was robbing a stereo shop. (laughs) I wasn't. I don't know. I guess I was doing the same thing you were doing, not solving crime.

LASSITER:
You're not helping your case here.

SHAWN:
My case? Wait, wait, wait. I'm actually a suspect?

LASSITER:
Oh, you're our lead suspect.

SHAWN:
I gave you the guy.

LASSITER:
He had a partner.

SHAWN:
I have to find that guy? I'm confused. When do you start chipping in?

LASSITER:
See, your information was good. So good, it could only have come from the inside.

SHAWN:
Inside of what? Look, I've called in dozens of tips, okay? Just check it out.

LASSITER:
I did. I checked out a whole lot of stuff. Like, oh, you're currently unemployed. (opens folder on table and sits) You've never held a job for more than six months. And you have a criminal record.

SHAWN:
I was 18.

LASSITER:
Oh. 18? Well, that makes it okay. Let me just scratch this out.

SHAWN:
(looks at LUCINDA) I borrowed a car.

LASSITER:
You stole a car.

SHAWN:
To impress a girl.

LUCINDA:
Look, forgive us, Mr. Spencer, if this seems far-fetched.

SHAWN:
Would it help at all if I told you that she had a bit of a reputation and I was 0 for... high school? Okay, fine. There were extenuating circumstances. The arresting officer was my father. He was trying to teach me a lesson.

LASSITER:
Did you learn it?

SHAWN:
I learned I hated my father. So sure.

LASSITER:
Pardon me if I'm just a little skeptical. Believable as it is that you solved all these crimes... I'm sorry, what was it? Watching the local channel 8 news reports.

SHAWN:
I confess. That's not true. Sometimes I watch channel 5. I prefer channel 8. The weather girl, adorable.

LASSITER:
So you're telling us that you can read guilt off of tv interviews.

SHAWN:
Can't you?

LASSITER:
Don't you try and trivialize police work.

SHAWN:
I think you're doing a bang-up job of that all by yourself. You can't keep me here, guys. I know my rights.

(stands and walks to the door)

LASSITER:
Good. Then you know you have the right to remain silent.

SHAWN opens the door and McNAB blocks his exit.

LASSITER:
You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you.

LUCINDA stands.

SHAWN:
Wait, wait, wait. You're serious?

LASSITER:
A few hours in a holding cell might jog your memory.

SHAWN looks down the hall into the holding cell at the men inside and the public toilet. He gulps.

LUCINDA:
Just give us a reason, Mr. Spencer. That's all we need. How did you get this information?

LASSITER:
No. It is too late for that. (walks over) Officer Allen, book him.

ALLEN walks up behind SHAWN and pulls his arms behind his back as she reaches for her cuffs.

SHAWN:
Book him? Oh, come on. Cuffs? What, for the walk back to the lobby?

LUCINDA:
Or you could give us a plausible explanation.

SHAWN turns his head and sees the crystal pendant ALLEN is wearing as well as her mystical earrings. He puts his hands up.

SHAWN:
Okay. Okay. Fine. You win. I got the information because... I am a psychic.

ALLEN drops her cuffs.

LASSITER:
Get him out of here!

SHAWN:
Oh, boy!(falls back against the door, hand to his head) (to ALLEN) Your grandma would be so proud.

ALLEN:
You spoke to her?

SHAWN:
I did. She's... safe, comfortable. She wants you to stop spending all your money on those charlatans.

ALLEN:
(cups her face) The palm readers.

SHAWN:
The palm readers.

LUCINDA:
Okay, just to be clear, um, you're claiming to be a psychic, Mr. Spencer.

SHAWN faces LASSITER and LUCINDA, his arms outstretched, palms facing the two detectives.

SHAWN:
How else would I know that you two are sleeping together?

ALLEN and McNAB share a knowing glance.

SHAWN:
One, two, three... One, two, three... One, two, three... One...(points at McNAB) When's the wedding?

McNAB:
May 3rd. Wait. How... how did you know?

SHAWN:
I'm getting dance lessons for a wedding reception. And you are getting good.

McNAB:
Wow. That's amazing.

LASSITER:
Oh, come on. Who's buying this?

ALLEN smiles at him and McNAB raises his hand. One of the men in the holding cell raises a hand as well.

SHAWN:
I got it! Go to detention room number two. Shake down your vandal. You'll find all the evidence you need...(shakes his left foot) all the evidence is in his left shoe.

LASSITER:
We'll be back here in three minutes (to ALLEN) with my own cuffs. (leaves)

SHAWN:
(sighs) Whoa.

INT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, FRONT DESK, DAY

SHAWN is at the desk with ALEEN. In the background, an officer escorts the MAN from the bench to the cells.

LASSITER and LUCINDA stand and watch.

SHAWN:
I'm getting... I am getting... the letter L.

ALLEN:
Lulu, her dog. Is there anything else she said?

SHAWN looks over his shoulder and sees the detectives.

SHAWN:
Uh, there's suddenly a very, very negative presence here. It's blocking me.

LASSITER:
It was a lucky guess.

LUCINDA:
Lucky guess? (holds evidence bag with bits of taillight)

LASSITER:
He planted it. I don't know.

LUCINDA:
His alibi checks.

SHAWN:
Question. Do I pay taxes on reward money?

ALLEN:
I'll find out. Please feel free to call anytime.

SHAWN:
You know I will. Magic touch.

They touch fingertips through the hole in the plexiglass. SHAWN leaves. LASSITER walks over and slaps a file on the counter. ALLEN glares at him as he walks away.

EXT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, DAY

SHAWN exits the building with a smile and walks down the steps.

SHAWN:
(to passing officer) Doctor.

A pregnant woman, Interim Police Chief VICK, follows him out.

VICK:
Not so fast, Mr. Spencer.

SHAWN stops and turns around.

VICK:
Karen Vick, interim police chief.

SHAWN:
I know.

VICK:
Heard about what you did in there.

SHAWN:
Oh, you're welcome.

VICK:
That wasn't the phrase I was going to use. I was going to say improbable. Possible, yet unlikely.

SHAWN:
Look, it's hard to explain. I'm gifted. I was born that way.

VICK:
I knew your father. He was a good cop. You're nothing like him.

SHAWN:
I take that as a compliment, ma'am.

VICK:
Don't ever call me "ma'am".

SHAWN:
Am I still free to go?

VICK:
Not exactly. You familiar with the McCallum family?

SHAWN:
McCallum. Yeah, they own half the hill.

VICK:
Well, there's been a kidnapping.

SHAWN:
Oh, come on. I had nothing to do with that.

VICK:
Would you like to? The feds are itching to jump in on this case, and I need to make some progress. What I need is a miracle. Or a facsimile of one.

SHAWN:
I see, I see. Well, I make $1,200 a day.

VICK:
It's a try-out.

SHAWN:
That's what I meant to say. This is pro bono, something for you.

VICK:
And if this psychic thing is a scam... we will prosecute. You know hindering a police investigation is a criminal offense. (turns around and heads back inside)

SHAWN:
Sounds good. We're on the same team now. Kidnappers beware!

SHAWN turns around, exhales, and then smiles as he walks back to his motorcycle.

INT. CENTRAL COAST PHARMACEUTICALS, DAY

SHAWN strides down the hallway, helmet in hand. He opens the door to one of the offices.

INT. CENTRAL COAST PHARMACEUTICALS, GUS' OFFICE, DAY

Inside, his best friend GUS is sitting at his computer.

SHAWN:
I have a job for you.

GUS:
I already have a job.

SHAWN:
They're paying you to play video games?

GUS:
How do you do that?

SHAWN:
Come on, left hand, space bar, right hand, arrow keys? Gus, you should ask me a challenging question every once in awhile just for kicks.

GUS:
I can't go anywhere. (stands) I'm behind on my route. I got new samples of serum moxacillin. (checks shelves)

SHAWN reaches over and takes a bag of pretzels from a drawer.

SHAWN:
Oh, man. I'm sorry. I didn't realize the new butt cream had come in. So you're not interested in hearing about doing the thing we've been dreaming of doing since we were eight. I've got us the last job we will ever need.

GUS:
Shawn, you've had 57 jobs since we left high school.

SHAWN:
Yes, I have. And they were all fun, but this one takes the cake.

GUS:
Oh, yeah? Better than your acupuncture clinic?

SHAWN:
I didn't realize experience was necessary.

GUS:
What about the summer you spent driving the wiener mobile?

SHAWN:
I did that for the hot dogs. Look, Gus, all those jobs I took because I wanted the experience. But then I mastered it and I moved on. But this job has a little bit of everything. Come with me.

GUS:
(sits at desk) Uh, no. I'm never doing anything blindly with you again. I learned that at the Mexican border twice.

SHAWN:
Okay, this is hard to explain, but I'm going to give it a shot. You and I... are opening our own private detective agency.

GUS:
Oh. See? No explanation necessary. Let me get my coat. (goes back to his computer)

SHAWN:
But you're not getting your coat.

GUS:
Uh, no. No, Shawn. I'm not.

SHAWN:
All right, you want to sweat the details? Fine. The cops think I'm a psychic, and now we are investigating a kidnapping.

GUS:
You're serious?

SHAWN:
Yes, I am serious! Six days ago, Camden McCallum Jr., sole male heir to McCallum Textiles, was seen being forced into his Range Rover at the municipal dog park. No one's seen him or the dog since.

GUS:
They took the dog?

SHAWN:
You see what I mean? I need you. I need you to... to write stuff down 'cause you know how I zone out when other people talk.

GUS:
Just for today?

SHAWN:
Just today. Oh, and you know what, you should bring your sample case because some of those forensics guys...

GUS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's going to be forensics guys there?

EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS drive along in GUS' company car. SHAWN is reading the case file.

SHAWN:
All right, pay attention. 18 months ago, Camden McCallum ran his father's cigarette boat into the Morrow Bay aquarium. That was right after he got caught with that hockey player's wife.

GUS:
Yeah, I remember that.

SHAWN:
Guy hadn't been out of the papers in five years. Since that day, nothing. Not a single news story. Not so much as a dented motorcycle.

GUS:
Okay. What do you think?

SHAWN:
I think Camden McCallum is too good at what he does to stop. Not cold turkey anyway. Beautiful women, fast cars. Doesn't add up. Something happened.

EXT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, FRONT DRIVE, DAY

GUS takes his sample case out of the back while SHAWN stands in the drive and looks at the house. They then walk towards the house.

GUS:
How should we introduce ourselves? Don't say "psychic". They'll shut you off. Say something vague. Like
"alternative tactics division".

SHAWN:
How about the bureau of magic and spell casting?

SHAWN sees the garbage bins being put out and walks over.

GUS:
Where are you going?

EXT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, SIDE DRIVE, DAY

SHAWN opens one of the bins and tosses out some of the plastic bags.

GUS:
You're rooting through the trash?

SHAWN:
Just for a second.

GUS:
You are without doubt the worst detective I've ever seen.

SHAWN:
Gus, everything you need is right in front of you. You just have to pay attention.

GUS:
Oh, yeah?

SHAWN pulls out a battered lampshade then spies something else.

SHAWN:
Look at this. (pulls out an empty bag of dog food) Berenson's brand. That is the highest quality dog food on the market.

GUS:
Perfect. They pamper their pets. The case is almost solved.

SHAWN:
This stuff is really expensive. (finds two more bags) No additives. No preservatives. Why would you possibly open three bags simultaneously when you only have one dog?

GUS:
They're rich. They waste money.

SHAWN:
(looks into bin) Oh, my God.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
This CD case is totally nice! Why would someone throw this out? Here, put this in the car.

SHAWN hands the case to GUS who then throws it back in the bin.

GUS:
Inside now. (heads for the front door)

With GUS looking the other way, SHAWN retrieve the CD case and slips it under his jacket before catching up with GUS.

SHAWN:
Is it entirely too early for me to have a theory?

GUS:
Can you at least wait until we see some evidence?

SHAWN:
I suppose I could if it would make you happier.

INT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk through the sumptuously furnished hall, passing other police.

SHAWN:
Whoa. Just act natural.

They stop at the entrance to the living room which is doubling as a base. LASSITER and LUCINDA are already there. LASSITER glares at them. GUS takes SHAWN by the arm and pulls him away.

GUS:
They know.

SHAWN:
How could they know?

GUS:
They know.

SHAWN:
We haven't said anything yet.

GUS:
They know. I can feel it.

SHAWN:
Oh, you're a psychic now too?

GUS:
You're not a psychic.

SHAWN:
(pulls GUS further from the living room)(whispers) Gus, let's just be clear on one thing. The only way they can absolutely prove that I am not a psychic is if I tell them. And I can guarantee you, that is the one thing I will never do. (sees something down the hall) Ooh. Ooh ooh. Check this out. (walks away)

GUS:
You got a lead? (follows)

INT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, FRONT HALL, DAY

SHAWN walks to a family portrait hanging on the wall.

SHAWN:
No. But look at this girl. She must be the sister. God, she's incredible.

GUS:
Kind of have a few other things going on right now, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(picks up framed photo) Oh, Gus, look. Look how she went from this awkward stage with this really
unfortunate perm to this beautiful, amazing girl. She's a late bloomer, but what does... what does that mean? That means depth of character.

GUS walks off to the side, taking deep breaths.

SHAWN:
(sees another photo) Gus, she kayaks. (turns and sees GUS) What, are you Lamaze breathing?

GUS:
It helps. I cover a few birthing centers.

SHAWN:
Let me know when the contractions are two minutes apart. (goes back to studying photos) She reads Vonnegut. Wow! She's an aviatrix. Gus, I bet this girl is spectacular.

WOMAN:
Really now?

SHAWN and GUS look to the stairs and see the woman from the photos. She continues down as she talks.

WOMAN:
I'm Katarina McCallum.

SHAWN:
I'm... thoroughly embarrassed.

KATARINA:
I'll bet you are.

SHAWN:
(walks to her) I'm sorry. I'm Shawn Spencer. The chief called me in. (takes her hand) Everything's gonna be okay.

KATARINA:
Thank you for saying that. I have the same feeling. What makes you think so?

SHAWN:
I'm a psychic.

KATARINA:
They called in a psychic?

SHAWN:
I have very unique and special abilities.

KATARINA:
Well, Shawn Spencer, if you need to ask any questions...

SHAWN:
Just one. Do you currently have a boyfriend?

KATARINA:
Is that pertinent?

SHAWN:
It very well could be.

KATARINA:
Uh, well, yes. I'm sort of seeing someone. Nothing serious though.

SHAWN:
Nothing too serious. That's good. That's very good. (looks to GUS then back to KATARINA) I think that's it for now. I'll be in touch.

KATARINA leaves.

GUS:
How do you luck into these women all the time?

SHAWN:
Gus, please. I am a professional gathering information.

INT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is looking through a photo album. All around them, the police have set up maps and diagrams.

GUS:
What are we looking for?

SHAWN:
Pictures of that Katarina girl. Preferably at the beach, maybe on her way to yoga. Or at a Halloween party dressed as a cat.

GUS takes out a foil packet of pills.

SHAWN:
What are those for?

GUS:
It's for anxiety.

SHAWN:
Is it ethical to sample your own samples?

LUCINDA:
Mr. Spencer, the sketch artist is here for you.

SHAWN:
The sketch artist.

LUCINDA:
The chief insisted.

SHAWN:
Interim chief.

LUCINDA:
Yeah. You call her that. (leaves)

SHAWN:
(to GUS) I'll be right back.

INT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, DEN, DAY

The sketch artist has drawn a man wearing a jacket and knitted cap.

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah. That's nice. Yeah, with the shading. The shading's nice. Uh, here's a question. Do you think you could have him looking further to the left... his eye line further to the left?

GUS finds him.

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
Yeah?

GUS:
Can I talk to you for a second?

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah. (to artist) So just more to the left, and I think we're there. All right. (stands and walks to GUS) What's up?

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
Just... just work with me.

GUS:
Tell them your blocked or something.

SHAWN:
I'm gonna have to use that later. (to artist) Uh, how we looking over there?

The artist shows SHAWN the sketch.

SHAWN:
Oh, that's great. Now look how good that is.

GUS sees a photograph on a table that shows the man in that exact pose.

SHAWN:
See how he's looking off to the left like he's seeing something? As far as the hair goes, can we get the bangs wispier like he's trying to compensate for like maybe he's thinning in the back and sort of got a swoop?

An older WOMAN who is talking with LUCINDA sees the sketch and screams. KATARINA enters the room behind GUS and SHAWN.

WOMAN:
Oh, my gosh! It's Bill! Oh, it's Bill! Oh, honey, come here quick. Bill's the kidnapper!

KATARINA looks at the sketch.

KATARINA:
That's the exact cap I gave him.

GUS walks over and blocks the photo from view.

SHAWN:
Okay, everybody. Stop. (closes his eyes as if having a vision) No, no! I'm sorry. Bill is not the
kidnapper.

GUS picks up the photo and tucks it under his jacket.

SHAWN:
Not the kidnapper. Bill is just a horrible human being. (KATARINA is aghast) Who is "Bill"? I'm getting, uh, multiple women. Is he a bigamist? Pimp? Does he sell children on the black market?

EXT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, FRONT DOOR, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are leaving just as Mr. MacCALLUM arrives.

SHAWN:
Mr. McCallum, I'm Shawn Spencer, the psychic.

MacCALLUM:
Well, thank you for coming. If there's anything i can do...

SHAWN:
I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you, sir.

MacCALLUM:
Nothing can prepare you for something like this knowing you can't do anything. Call me any time with any questions. (starts to go inside)

SHAWN:
Uh, actually, I do have one question, sir. How did he feel about the dog?

MacCALLUM:
Well, he loved that damn thing. Didn't do anything without it.

SHAWN:
Yeah. That'll do it. Thank you, sir.

MacCALLUM goes inside and SHAWN and GUS head for the car.

EXT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, FRONT DRIVE, DAY

GUS:
Does he like his dog? That's how you investigate?

SHAWN:
I think we're making progress.

GUS:
Since you've been here, all you've done is dig through the trash, hit on the victim's sister, and falsely accuse her boyfriend.

SHAWN:
Gus, he is not her boyfriend. She made a point to say they're free to see other people.

GUS:
Whatever you say, Shawn. Have a blast. I quit.

SHAWN:
You can't quit. We just got started.

SHAWN stops as GUS keeps walking.

GUS:
Watch me.

GUS puts his case in the car's backseat.

SHAWN:
It's gonna be fun!

GUS gets in the car and starts the engine.

SHAWN:
Gus, get back here!

GUS backs out of the driveway.

SHAWN:
Fine. I'll solve this case by myself.

INT. GUS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM, MORNING

The clock on the nighttable reads 6:07. GUS opens his eyes as he hears a door close. Realizing someone is in his apartment, he climbs out of bed and heads for the door.

INT. GUS' APARTMENT, HALL, MORNING

GUS peeks out of the door before dashing across the hall to where his sample case is. He grabs it and rushes to the kitchen with a shout.

INT. GUS' APARTMENT, KITCHEN, MORNING

SHAWN is calmly pouring himself a cup of coffee. GUS rolls his eyes.

SHAWN:
Gus, I hate to imagine what the rest of your plan was.

GUS:
How did you get in?

SHAWN picks up a fake stone off the counter and flips it open to reveal a key.

SHAWN:
Far less effective on a second-floor landing.

GUS:
(puts down case) What do you want, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Can I ask you something about the case, please?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
I was right.

GUS:
I'm done, Shawn. I don't want to commit felonies and perjury and pretend to be...

SHAWN:
You're dying to know who kidnapped him. I know you are.

GUS:
No. No, I'm not. Because I don't believe that you can solve a crime the cops can't by simply walking through a house.

SHAWN:
Fine.

GUS:
Fine.

GUS picks up the case and leaves the kictchen. SHAWN leans against the counter and blows on his coffee. GUS slowly walks back and stops in the doorway. SHAWN smiles.

GUS:
All right, whatever. Who kidnapped him?

SHAWN:
Nobody.

GUS:
Nobody! Excellent. Call the chief at home. Tell her the crime is solved. Because apparently, we just imagined the whole thing.

SHAWN:
Gus, nobody kidnapped him because he did it himself. (motions to kitchen table) Come on. See for yourself.

They sit at the table where photos are spread out and SHAWN give GUS a coffee.

SHAWN:
Okay. Here's the thing. Camden didn't offer to clean up his act voluntarily. Oh, no. Daddy threatened to cut him off permanently. This was about 18 months ago.

GUS:
18 months?

SHAWN:
But wait. There's more. He had help.

GUS:
Who?

SHAWN:
(points to a man in a group photo) This guy on the end. Malcolm Orso. Only member of this crew that didn't go on to fame or fortune or rehab.

GUS:
The cops must've talked to him.

SHAWN:
Nope. Malcolm hasn't been seen with Camden for quite some time. To be exact...

GUS:
18 months.

SHAWN:
Almost to the day. Gus, he has been planning this thing for over a year.

GUS:
Shawn, this is good.

SHAWN:
Yeah.

GUS:
Where did you get this?

SHAWN:
Katarina McCallum's room.

GUS:
You didn't go in her room!

SHAWN:
Gus, I needed a ride. She hadn't eaten yet. One thing led to another, and we ended up sharing a milk shake.

GUS:
Whoa, wait a second. Wait a second. You're dating her?

SHAWN:
No. I'm not "dating".

GUS:
Yes, you are.

SHAWN:
It's not exclusive. (GUS stands and walks away) What? Gus, come on! Put some clothes on. This is gonna be fun. (claps) Let's go! I'm driving. Where are your keys? (finds keys) Never mind. I got 'em. Ooh. (holds up pineapple) Should I slice this up for the road?

Part 2

Episode 1x01 Pilot (2/2)

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD, MORNING

SHAWN is speeding along the road and a police chases them with sirens on. The OFFICER pulls them over and walks to the car.

GUS:
Well, we're off to a banner start.

SHAWN:
Just let me do the talking. (pulls driver's license from pocket)

OFFICER:
Morning, gentlemen.

SHAWN:
Hello, Officer. (hands over license)

OFFICER:
(turns over license to see card stuck on the back) What's this?

SHAWN:
Whoops. It's my dad's old police business card. Must've stuck in back there. Guess I've been carrying that in my wallet for ages. Can never be too careful coming from a family of cops.

OFFICER:
Henry Spencer's your dad?

SHAWN:
Yes. Yes, he is.

OFFICER:
Well, how's old Henry doing?

SHAWN:
Oh, you know Henry. He's great. Retired. Living in Miami.

OFFICER:
I saw Henry three weeks ago at the Home Depot.

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, that... that sounds about right. He popped into down for a few days, grabbed some supplies, some wood.

OFFICER:
Said he'd been back for over a year.

SHAWN:
And now he's back. Running around doing his thing Henry style.

OFFICER:
Tell your dad the Kingfisher says hello. (hands license back)

SHAWN:
Will do. Thank you, Officer.

The OFFICER walks back to his car.

GUS:
Your dad's back at the house?

SHAWN:
Apparently.

EXT. WOODS, DAY

SHAWN hurries along the path as GUS follows.

SHAWN:
Dude, I'm so excited. This is my first use of spy technology. (peers through binoculars)

GUS:
Yeah, it would seem much cooler if it didn't have Sports Illustrated pasted on the side.

SHAWN:
(looks at logo) Came with the subscription.

SHAWN resumes looking through the binoculars at the cabin across the lake from them. They can see a couple of kayaks and a red sports car.

GUS:
Are you going to tell me why we're here?

SHAWN:
This is the Orso family cabin where young Malcolm and young Camden spent all their summers growing up.

GUS:
Wouldn't the police have checked this out?

SHAWN:
Malcolm is so far out on the periphery of Camden's life. He's not on the witness list. He's not on anybody's list. (puts down binoculars) This is a great plan. Camden McCallum deserves to be commended. (looks through binoculars)

GUS:
Maybe you should date him too.

SHAWN:
(lowers binoculars) Maybe I will.

GUS:
(grabs binoculars) Let me see. (looks through binoculars) Let's see here.

Through the binoculars, GUS sees Camden MacCallum's dog trotting along the shore of the lake.

GUS:
Oh no way.

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
It's Camden's dog.

SHAWN:
Get... dude! Dude!

GUS:
(lowers binoculars) Oh, my gosh. I can't believe we did this. This is unbelievable. What?

They start jumping in excitement.

GUS:
Okay, okay, okay. Wait. Okay, wait. Let's call the cops. No, no, no. Let's call the chief. That's what we're gonna do. Call the chief. Yeah. (looks through binoculars)

SHAWN:
No, no, no. No, no, no. Gus, Gus.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
We don't call anyone.

GUS:
(lowers binoculars) What?

SHAWN:
Then later at headquarters, I suddenly and miraculously have a vision.

GUS:
A vision?

SHAWN:
A vision of stuff we saw. Like, uh, like the road sign with the two bullet holes. Like the red kayak, the yellow kayak. And the highway with numbers. Oh, I'm seeing... what am I seeing? 8-3-1.

GUS:
We're on highway 138.

SHAWN:
Exactly. In the spirit world, things get jumbled and out of sequence. But my premonition becomes clear when we all jump in the squad car together. By the way, let me sit next to that junior detective.

GUS:
Shawn, please.

SHAWN:
An, at last, we lead them here. Then finally, we both put on our surprise faces as I guide them to the cabin for the "first time". This is mine. (gasps and shows his surprise face) What do you got?

GUS' expression doesn't change as he tosses the binoculars at SHAWN and walks away.

SHAWN:
Gus, that's horrible. It doesn't convey surprise at all. Gus! (runs after GUS)

EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS park the car and walk along the street.

SHAWN:
All right, let me do the talking.

GUS:
Is there even an option?

SHAWN:
I want... I want a lot of witnesses for my miraculous vision.

GUS sees LASSITER and LUCINDA walking along the sidewalk.

GUS:
Yeah, yeah. There they go. Detectives!

SHAWN and GUS run up to them.

GUS:
Detectives! Detectives! We have a breakthrough.

SHAWN:
It is very important.

LASSITER:
I also have something important. I call it lunch. Make an appointment.

GUS:
But this is...

LASSITER:
You don't have my interest. You don't have my ear. Find a beat cop. Tell your story. Maybe I'll read the report. Good day, gentlemen. (to LUCINDA) After you.

SHAWN:
Detective! (pretends to have a vision) Don't eat the chicken.

LASSITER and LUCINDA enter the restaurant.

GUS:
Don't eat the chicken?

SHAWN jerks his head and they cross the road.

INT. RESTAURANT, DAY

LUCINDA and LASSITER enter the restaurant. They sit at a table and look out the open window where they can see SHAWN and GUS cross the street.

LUCINDA:
He's got your number.

LASSITER:
He's got nothing. (to WAITRESS) I'll have the chicken enchilada. Extra chicken.

WAITRESS:
Okay.

LUCINDA:
I'll have the cheese quesadilla.

WAITRESS:
Coming right up. (leaves)

LASSITER:
Coward.

LUCINDA:
You're mad because he pegged us as a couple.

LASSITER:
(leans back and scoffs) He was tipped off. Did you tell anyone?

LUCINDA:
Why would I tell anyone? Let everyone think I'm working my way up the ladder the hard way? You're barely
separated.

LASSITER:
It's been five months.

A waiter brings their water. LASSITER looks into the kitchen and sees the cook.

EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are leaning against a rail and watching the detectives inside.

GUS:
So the plan was to annoy them into believing you.

SHAWN:
Billy Camp's working the grill.

GUS:
So?

SHAWN:
So? Billy Camp has the worst hay fever I've ever seen. Feel this wind? Feel it?

INT. RESTAURANT, DAY

LASSITER hears Billy Camp sneeze and looks into the kitchen to see him sneezing while holding the chicken.

LASSITER:
I will be right back.

EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET, DAY

SHAWN:
Here we go. Act natural.

LASSITER:
(steps onto sidewalk) Okay. What is it?

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD, MORNING

LASSITER and LUCINDA are in the front, LASSITER behind the wheel. In the back seat, SHAWN practices his surprise face while GUS glares at him and then slaps him.

EXT. WOODS, DAY

LASSITER parks the car and they all get out.

LASSITER:
This is great. Now what?

SHAWN:
Does anyone have any binoculars? (starts down the trail)

LASSITER:
No. No. You see, we don't carry binoculars.

SHAWN takes his from his back pocket.

SHAWN:
Ooh, never mind. I found some here in my pocket. (stops and looks through binoculars) There it is! Just like I saw it.

They continue on to where SHAWN and GUS stood earlier. LASSITER takes the binoculars.

LASSITER:
Want to tell me what I'm looking for, please?

SHAWN:
Uh, I'm... I'm not sure exactly. I see a bone?

LASSITER:
What, a human bone?

SHAWN:
No. No. Rawhide? And a ball.

LASSITER:
(sees the dog) Holy crap. (lowers binoculars) Call for backup.

LUCINDA heads back to the car.

SHAWN:
(feigned surprise) What? What do you see, detective?

EXT. CABIN, DAY

The SWAT team rushes the cabin. An ambulance and police cars line the road to the cabin. SHAWN and GUS follow LASSITER and LUCINDA up the road.

SHAWN:
I can't believe they won't let us in. This is lame.

GUS:
And you were so polite when you asked the S.W.A.T. Team to issue you the Luger.

SHAWN:
Just make sure you act in awe of me when they come to say I was completely right. Oh, and maybe a little afraid like my powers could possibly be used for evil.

Camden's dog comes running up to them and GUS puts his hands up and goes into a crouch.

GUS:
Oh, watch out! Watch out!

SHAWN:
Whoa! Whoa! (kneels to pet it) For what, it's tongue?

GUS:
That thing could be vicious!

SHAWN:
Yeah, and diabolical with its calculated decoy tail-wagging.

GUS:
There's blood on its whiskers.

SHAWN:
That's not blood, that's Snausages.

GUS:
Are you sure?

SHAWN:
Yes, I'm sure. Either that, or he just mauled a mountain lion. C'mon, Gus.

An OFFICER walks up to them.

OFFICER:
Mr. Spencer, follow me.

SHAWN stands, gives GUS a double thumbs-up and they follow the OFFICER to the cabin. The dog trots after them.

SHAWN:
Now if there's any press, make sure you mention our agency.

GUS:
We don't have an agency.

SHAWN:
Yes, we do. I applied for a DBA on-line, which reminds me, we're going to need a name. "Mindmasters"? Already taken. Make sure you tell them that we do private cases, 'cause I bet the department's only going to be good for one or two months.

GUS:
You tell them.

SHAWN:
I can't. I'm secretive, mysterious, enigmatic.

GUS:
Delusional.

SHAWN:
Remember, act surprised.

SHAWN and GUS enter the cabin.

INT. CABIN, DAY

The police are working in the cabin and VICK holds a handkerchief to her nose. LASSITER and LUCINDA looks at SHAWN as he walks in.

SHAWN:
Wow. It is just like I saw before.

There are two dead bodies in the room; one lying on the floor, blood around the head, and the other sitting in a chair, bloody chest, gun in his hand. SHAWN also *sees* a tipped over coffee cup on the floor and the coffee pot on the stove looked like like it had boiled over. He also sees blood and some hair on the corner of the table. The detectives watch SHAWN.

GUS:
Pardon me, ladies, gentlemen. (runs from the cabin screaming)

INT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stand in front of VICK'S desk.

VICK:
The department has been approved to call on you again, Mr. Spencer. And even though this case didn't end up exactly the way we hoped, (gives SHAWN check, GUS takes it from him) I thank you for your services. (shakes SHAWN'S hand) You were invaluable. Thank you.(shakes GUS' hand)

GUS:
Thank you.

VICK sits behind her desk and SHAWN sits as well.

SHAWN:
You're making a huge mistake. This case isn't closed.

VICK:
Pardon me?

GUS sits.

SHAWN:
Murder, suicide? Come on, you're buying that?

VICK:
I'm not buying anything. Those are the facts.

GUS:
I buy it. (slaps SHAWN on the arm and stands)

SHAWN:
I understand, I do. You'd like to shut the book on this as quickly as possible. It's fine.

GUS sits back down.

VICK:
They had a falling out.

SHAWN:
Why? What did they have to fight about before they got the cash?

VICK:
Might I remind you, Mr. Spencer, you are not a detective.

SHAWN:
I just need to speak to the witnesses again.

VICK:
The McCallum family has been through enough, and this conversation is over.

GUS:
Thank you. (stands) Uh, we parked in a parking structure, do you validate?

VICK just looks at GUS.

SHAWN:
Would it make any difference if I told you Camden McCallum Jr. spoke to me... from beyond the grave?

VICK:
(points to the door) Shut the door on your way out.

GUS slaps SHAWN on the arm.

SHAWN:
Damn it. (stands)

SHAWN and GUS exit the office.

INT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk through the room.

GUS:
What are you doing? That was the chief of police.

SHAWN:
Interim chief. And have you considered that Camden McCallum may have been alive the first time we went to that cabin?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Well, I have.

SHAWN looks into one of the offices and sees MacCALLUM shaking hands with LASSITER. MacCALLUM'S right wrist is bandaged.

SHAWN:
I need to talk to that guy.

GUS:
Whoa, whoa. No.

SHAWN:
Come on, Gus. Just for a second. The man is practically almost my father-in-law.

GUS:
Make no mistake, Shawn, I will kill you.

SHAWN:
Okay. I appreciate the fact that you think you can beat me up. But I think our last scuffle proves otherwise.

GUS:
Are you talking about the Cinnamon Festival?

SHAWN:
Yes! You do remember!

GUS:
Okay. First of all, I was six, and I had a cast!

SHAWN:
Which many would construe as a clear advantage. It's like having a weapon attached to your arm. Oh, great, now the chief is staring right at us. (rushes the door as it opens) Mr. McCallum!

LUCINDA comes out and cuts him off.

LUCINDA:
Chief wants them left alone.

SHAWN:
Well, we all want to be left alone.

LUCINDA:
Yeah, some more than others.

SHAWN:
What's with his wrist?

LUCINDA:
You don't give up, do you?

SHAWN:
I do give up. All the time. But not until the moment is right. Now come on. I know you don't think this adds up either.

LUCINDA:
Okay, the rumor is he tried to off himself.

SHAWN:
Off himself. The war hero? The man who's seen everything? No. That's not it. That's definitely not it.

LUCINDA:
You know everything, don't you?

SHAWN:
Yeah. It's scary, isn't it? Something is going on, and I'm gonna find out what it is.

SHAWN starts for the office again, but LASSITER stops him, puts an arm around his shoulder and walks with him.

LASSITER:
No. You're not going anywhere near that man. In fact, I'm going to make certain you never hear from the department again.

SHAWN:
I'm getting strong vibrations that you might be wrong.

LASSITER:
I'm on to you. You've got a source somewhere and I'm going to find it. You think this is some sort of game? I'm not going to let you just waltz around here like some kid in a candy store.

SHAWN:
Let me be honest with you, detective. I used to work in a candy store and it's nothing like this.

SHAWN walks away and GUS follows.

LASSITER:
You're in over your head, mystic.

EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET, DAY

SHAWN drives his motorcycle through the streets

EXT. SPENCER HOME, DAY

SHAWN parks his motorcycle and rings the doorbell. HENRY opens the door.

SHAWN:
Hi, Dad.

HENRY:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
You didn't tell me you moved back.

HENRY:
You didn't tell me you moved away.

SHAWN:
That was different.

HENRY:
Was it?

SHAWN:
Yeah. I was busy trying to help my mom through her divorce.

HENRY:
Well, it's nice to see you, too, son.

SHAWN:
Can I come in?

HENRY:
No. (puts on baseball cap and closes the door behind him) I was on my way out to lunch. (looks at motorcycle) You can come with me if you don't bring this thing.

SHAWN gets into the pickup truck with HENRY.

INT. RESTAURANT, DAY

HENRY and SHAWN are sitting at a table.

HENRY:
When I was in the department, there were two things i hated in this world. Private investigators and psychics.

SHAWN holds up his fingers as HENRY lists them.

HENRY:
Congratulations, kid. You just hit the disappointment exacta.

The waitress brings the check.

SHAWN:
Thank you. Thank you very much. It sort of happened by accident.

HENRY:
What are you gonna do when you get caught? Move out of town?

SHAWN:
I'm not going to get caught.

HENRY:
Shawn, this is just like everything else. Three months from now, you're going to be on a bus going to Minneapolis 'cause you found your calling as a weather man.

SHAWN:
It's not like that this time. Have you been listening to me? I finally figured out a way to use my special gift. You should be thrilled. You're the one that made me this way. I'm good at this.

HENRY:
Oh. Oh, oh, I see. If you're so good at it, what are you doing knocking at my door?

SHAWN:
You think I came to you for help. Okay. There was no ransom drop.

HENRY:
I'm not gonna be a part of this.

SHAWN:
Come on. Would you just hear me out?

HENRY:
(sighs) Okay. No ransom drop. So what? Big deal.

SHAWN:
So six days? Nothing? Not even a demand?

HENRY:
It happens all the time. It's not unprecedented. They try to create panic in the family.

SHAWN:
Yeah, I know. I know. But not this guy. This guy wanted it done quickly. I know that.

HENRY:
Well, then you missed something. You've been driving your motorcycle all across the country, working your bungee cord jumping expeditions. You're soft. Hey, pal, it happens.

SHAWN:
I'm not soft. I'm sharper than I've ever been.

HENRY:
Close your eyes.

SHAWN:
(chuckles) No way. I'm not seven.

HENRY:
Close your eyes. Any longer, I'll think you're cheating.

SHAWN closes his eyes with a sigh.

HENRY:
How many hats are in the room?

SHAWN:
All right. Fine. Just in case you're trying to pull a fast one, I'm not counting the one in your pocket. (puts fingers to his temples) Nylon fishing hat on the loner in the corner. (points out hats) Foam cap on the kid who's too young to know they were lame the first time they came out. Both truckers. One a concrete company I've never heard of, the other advertising free moustache rides. I'm fairly certain no one's taken him up on that offer. Norwegian girl, ponytail pulled out the back. Unfortunately, she's married. And our friendly bartender wearing the official hat of the restaurant. Six hats.

HENRY:
And?

SHAWN:
That's it.

HENRY:
Sorry, pal, there are seven hats. I can't help you. You missed something.

SHAWN:
I didn't miss anything.

HENRY:
There are seven hats, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(opens eyes) Were. Before I closed my eyes. Cowboy hat walked out while I was ridiculing moustache rides.

HENRY looks around the restaurant.

SHAWN:
Come on. I heard her boots.

HENRY:
All right. Close enough.

SHAWN:
Close enough? No, I nailed that.

HENRY:
(puts on jacket) Yeah, but you changed the rules. But, hey, if it makes you happy. (stands and walks away)

SHAWN:
(stands) Change the rules? (puts on jacket) I did not change the rules. What I did was nail it and you know it!

HENRY:
Shawn, you want my advice? Go out, get yourself a real job, grow up. In the meantime, you might want to ask yourself who you're trusting in this case that maybe you shouldn't. 'Cause obviously, you're overlooking somebody. Thanks for lunch. (gives SHAWN the bill and walks out)

EXT. MacCALLUM TEXTILES, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are in GUS' company car. SHAWN takes out the binoculars and watches the building.

GUS:
Why are we at the McCallum offices?

SHAWN:
What is the magnification on these things?

GUS:
2x.

SHAWN:
Okay, we need to stop at Wal-Mart on the way home.

GUS:
Why don't you just take your big, loud motorcycle?

SHAWN sees KATARINA leaving the building with a large bag.

SHAWN:
Ooh, here we go. Here we go.

GUS:
Oh, hell no. You got me out of work so you could stalk a girl?

KATARINA is with her boyfriend, Bill.

SHAWN:
Damn it. What is he doing here?

GUS:
I can't believe this!

SHAWN:
What's up with his hair? It's horrible. I knew I should've had him picked up for questioning. That is not the way a grown man kisses a grown woman. We're-we're fine. Why does she look so nervous? Oh, no. Is it just me or does that bag look like it's filled with stacks of ransom money?

GUS:
(takes binoculars and looks) Give me that. Oh, my God.

SHAWN:
Katarina.

KATARINA puts the bag in the trunk of her car and gets in the driver's seat.

GUS:
It was her. You're dating a murderer.

SHAWN:
Not exclusively.

GUS:
Wow!

GUS laughs and backs out the car to follow KATARINA.

EXT. DOWNTOWN SANTA BARBARA, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are following KATARINA.

GUS:
You see, I knew there was a reason she went for you so easily.

SHAWN:
She wasn't lying, Gus. I know when people are lying.

GUS:
Oh yeah? Apparently not. You just got played. (laughs)

KATARINA pulls into a back alley. SHAWN and GUS watch as she comes out of a building with a tall, bearded MAN

GUS:
Should we call the cops?

SHAWN:
Too late for that.

GUS:
You could pretend you had a vision of a girl totally manipulating you.

SHAWN:
Would you stop?

SHAWN sees KATARINA take out the bag and hits GUS to get him to look.

GUS:
What should we do? What should we do?

SHAWN:
There's only one thing to do.

SHAWN unhooks his seatbelt, opens the door and creeps behind a dumpster.

GUS:
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

SHAWN runs down the alley towards KATARINA.

KATARINA:
Shawn?

SHAWN grabs the bag from her hand and runs back towards the car.

KATARINA:
Hey!

SHAWN hugs the bag in front of him and runs into GUS coming in his direction. He drops the bag.

SHAWN:
What are you doing?

GUS:
Helping. (picks up bag)

They run back to the car.

SHAWN:
You're supposed to stay at the car.

GUS:
Well, come on!

SHAWN:
(tries to open the door) Gus, you locked the car?

GUS:
It's a bad neighborhood!

KATARINA:
What in the world's going on, Shawn?

SHAWN:
I know what's in the bag.

KATARINA:
You do?

SHAWN:
You're good. Very good. I didn't consider who'd be the sole heir to the McCallum fortune if Camden was out of the picture.

The MAN makes a lunge for SHAWN, but KATARINA halts him.

KATARINA:
Okay, okay. Wh... You think I want my family's money?

SHAWN:
You don't need it, do you, now that you've got... (unzips the bag and pulls out a towel) this money!

SHAWN goes through the bag to see old clothes. He looks at GUS over the car.

SHAWN:
We've got to get better binoculars.

The MAN grabs the bag and SHAWN sees the name of a thrift store on his hat and shirt. He heads back down the

alley and KATARINA follows.

SHAWN:
Katarina...

SHAWN looks at GUS who says nothing as he gets into the car.

LATER...

SHAWN and GUS are still sitting in the car in the alley, watching the door. The MAN looks in their direction before closing the door.

SHAWN:
Go buy the bag.

GUS:
What, you want a souvenir of your ineptitude?

SHAWN:
I need to get a better look inside the bag.

GUS:
I'm not going in there. That guy wants to kill us.

SHAWN:
Gus, this guy works in a thrift store. Okay? He's a big, furry hearted, Good Samaritan. Come on, I'll be right here. Go ahead.

GUS gets out of the car.

INT. THRIFT SHOP, DAY

GUS peeks around the door. The MAN spots him and GUS smiles before entering the shop.

MAN:
What the hell do you want?

GUS:
Can I have the bag?

MAN:
You serious?

GUS:
Just the bag, not the clothes. I'll pay you for it.

MAN:
You've got some nerve coming in here.

Over the MAN'S shoulder, GUS sees SHAWN enter through the other door.

GUS:
I can't believe this!

MAN:
Neither can I. I've gone to jail for less than you.

SHAWN passes one of the racks and pulls a shirt off and holds it up.

GUS:
Jail's no fun, I'll tell you that much.

MAN:
Oh, you've been.

GUS:
Once, in Monopoly.

The MAN lunges at GUS, fist raised.

GUS:
Okay, hold on, hold on. Who's that?

As the MAN turns around, GUS runs away. SHAWN, realizing he's been seen, drops the shirt, grabs the bag then runs out the way he came in.

MAN:
(chases SHAWN) Hey! Hey! Move, move, move, move! Hey, get back here!

EXT. DOWNTOWN SANTA BARBARA, DAY

SHAWN runs back to the car, chased by the MAN. He dives through the open window, legs hanging out.

SHAWN:
Go, go, go!

GUS drives down the alley.

SHAWN:
I can't believe you sold me out like that!

GUS:
You didn't tell me I was a decoy!

SHAWN:
Of course you're the decoy!

The MAN gives up chasing them.

INT. CENTRAL COAST PHARMACEUTICALS, GUS' OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN unzips the bag and feels around inside and then sniffs it.

SHAWN:
It seems pretty clean.

GUS:
What, they didn't happen to leave a ransom note inside?

SHAWN:
Give me some money.

GUS:
Get your own money.

SHAWN:
Gus, I'll give it back.

GUS pulls his wallet from his back pocket and gives SHAWN some bills.

SHAWN:
(counts money) Seriously, this is all you carry?

GUS sits at his desk as SHAWN begins to lay the money in the bottom of the bag.

SHAWN:
Okay, so we've got five stacks going across, and you figure four going long ways. Ten stacks in each pile based on the wear and the indentation... I don't know, depending on the denomination, uh, this could easily be $5 million.

GUS:
You're kidding.

SHAWN:
Yeah, give or take.

GUS:
You got that from a groove on the side?

SHAWN:
Come on, Gus. Any small child could've figured that out.

GUS:
So somebody at that house did pay a ransom.

SHAWN:
Mm-hmm. Or tried too.

GUS:
Who?

SHAWN:
I don't know. We're going to need more than my psychic powers to figure this out.

INT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, BULLPEN, NIGHT

SHAWN walks through the dimly lit room to see LUCINDA at her desk.

LUCINDA:
You here to scope out the new meter maids?

SHAWN:
Nope. I am here to see you.

LUCINDA:
Not interested.

SHAWN:
I know you. You have someone special. He's married and/or separated.

LUCINDA:
Is there a point to this, Mr. Spencer?

SHAWN:
Of course. You and I have something in common.

LUCINDA:
What's that?

SHAWN:
We both know this case is nowhere near closed.

LUCINDA:
Unfortunately, (closes briefcase) gut feelings aren't admissible in a California court.(stands)

SHAWN:
How about motive?

LUCINDA:
What do you have?

SHAWN:
Nothing yet. But I've seen something.

LUCINDA:
Seen or *seen*?

SHAWN:
(sits on the corner of her desk) Well, what do you think?

LUCINDA:
(looks around) Okay, what do you need?

SHAWN:
Everything you have on Malcolm Orso. He was Camden's accomplice.

LUCINDA:
(puts on jacket) I'll get fired.

SHAWN:
Will you really? Because it seems like a gray area to me.

LUCINDA:
That's the problem with you, Mr. Spencer. You live your entire life in a gray area.

SHAWN:
That's not true. Though I generally vacation in gray areas.

LUCINDA looks around again before tugging at a file SHAWN is sitting on.

LUCINDA:
We can't talk here.

LUCINDA jerks her head and walks away. SHAWN gets up and follows her.

INT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, FIRING RANGE, NIGHT

LUCINDA shoots at a target as SHAWN looks through the file.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. It says Orso was seen in the town near the cabin.

LUCINDA:
Yeah. (fires) Twice. Early in the week by a store owner.

SHAWN:
What was he buying?

LUCINDA:
(fires) Nothing. The old man just saw him on the street.

SHAWN:
Same old man sees him two times?

LUCINDA:
Mm-hmm. Yeah. (fires) Orso had one of those modified mufflers on his Nova. You could hear him a block away.

(reloads and sets gun down) You'll need a new target sheet. (walks over to him)

SHAWN:
Oh, oh, no, no, no. (sets down file) This is, uh, this is fine. (lifts gun awkwardly) They're so much lighter when they're filled with water. (six shots in quick succession)

SHAWN looks at the target sheet, satisfied. LUCINDA looks at it.

LUCINDA:
You missed.

SHAWN:
Did I really?

LUCINDA presses the button to call the target forward and looks at SHAWN patronizingly. They both lean on the counter and look at the sheet. SHAWN'S shots overlap LUCINDA'S perfectly.

SHAWN:
Look at that. It's a perfect match.

LUCINDA:
Damn.

SHAWN smiles.

INT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, FRONT HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the residence and stand at the foot of the stairs.

GUS:
I'm telling you, there's no way Katarina's going to talk to you.

SHAWN:
Yeah, well, I sort of lied about that part. We're not here to see Katarina.

GUS:
Who we were to see?

MacCALLUM walks down the stairs.

MacCALLUM:
This is highly inappropriate, Mr. Spencer. The investigation is over.

SHAWN:
What if they got the wrong man?

MacCALLUM:
And who would the right man be?

SHAWN:
You.

INT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, DEN, DAY

MacCALLUM opens the door and motions for SHAWN and GUS to enter the room.

GUS:
Mr. McCallum, I didn't have anything to do with this.

MacCALLUM:
(shuts door) I killed my own son?

SHAWN:
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you meant to.

MacCALLUM:
You're not a detective. You're not even a cop.

SHAWN:
You're right. I'm a psychic. And I saw the whole thing.

SHAWN puts his left hand to his temple and describes everything that happened and we see it in quick flashbacks. The scenes cut between SHAWN'S descriptions and his confrontation with MacCALLUM.

SHAWN:
I see a ransom drop. You're doing everything they ask. You didn't call the police. You're thinking of nothing but the security of your son. After all, what's $5 million to you? You're driving away. I can see it. Something strange happens. You recognize the car. You pass it on the hill. It's Malcolm Orso'S. You've seen it hundreds of times at your house ever since high school. You know where they are. You know the cabin. He's making coffee. You didn't mean to kill him, did you?  No. Just knock him around a little bit. Teach him a lesson. But he falls to the floor. He slams his head on the oak table. He's dead. You know he's dead. Orso walks in, finds you. He's got a half-ass pistol. But he's no criminal. You know there's only one way to cover your tracks. You take care of him too. Make it look like a suicide. (MacCALLUM sits)  Then you come home, inform the police, and you wait. You wait for a ransom call that will never come. Police eat it up. It's easy to look shaken after all you've done. You might even be willing to take your own life.

MacCALLUM:
You have an overactive imagination. Perhaps a side-effect of your gift.

GUS:
(gags) Shawn, we need to go.

SHAWN:
Not yet.

GUS:
I'm about to throw up on a Turkish carpet.

SHAWN:
No, you're not.

GUS:
It's in my esophagus. (covers mouth)

SHAWN:
The second door on the left. Turn on the fan and flush.

GUS rushes from the room.

MacCALLUM:
I will not have this incident rehashed over and over again!

SHAWN:
I know what your relationship was with your son.

MacCALLUM:
Oh, really?

SHAWN:
I have a father that I disappoint all the time.

MacCALLUM:
I'm sure you do.

SHAWN:
(sits) I know how you feel. This was it. This was the straw that broke the camel's back, wasn't it? To think 18 months ago, he sat across from you, looked you right in the eye and said, "Dad, I'm going to clean up my act this time. This time, I am going to change. I swear". To know that he duped you and you fell for it all over again must've sent you into a state that even you can't believe.

MacCALLUM stands and SHAWN does as well, backing away from him.

MacCALLUM:
Mr. Spencer, I've been assured but the Lieutenant Governor that this case will not cast a pall over my family. But I can assure you, it's gonna cast one over yours.

SHAWN:
My very first case, I'm already being threatened. Wow!

GUS re-enters the room.

GUS:
Shawn, let's go.

SHAWN:
I'm not quite finished.

GUS:
We're going now.

MacCALLUM:
Listen to your friend.

GUS grabs SHAWN by the arm and pulls him towards the door. SHAWN stops and looks back and MacCALLUM.

SHAWN:
I'll be back.

MacCALLUM:
No, you won't.

GUS and SHAWN leave the room.

EXT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, FRONT DOOR, DAY

Two employees "help" SHAWN and GUS leave.

SHAWN:
Okay, we're going. We're clearly going. All right! (to GUS) Dude, what are you doing? We had him on the ropes.

GUS:
It wasn't the right tack.

EXT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, FRONT DRIVE, DAY

They walk to the car.

SHAWN:
Oh, you're the expert now?

GUS:
Consumine.

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
Consumine. It's for dog bites. I have some samples.

SHAWN:
Gus, what are you saying to me?

GUS:
I'm saying there was a bottle of it in the medicine cabinet prescribed Wednesday. You wonder why he had on that long-sleeve shirt in the heat that first day?

SHAWN:
Oh, my gosh! That dog did have blood on his teeth.

GUS:
I told you it wasn't Snausages.

They get into the car.

GUS:
We're never getting back in there.

SHAWN:
I know. Just give me a second. (closes eyes and puts fingers to his temples)

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
I'm thinking.

GUS:
You look ridiculous.

SHAWN opens his eyes, pulls out his phone and dials.

GUS:
Now what are you doing?

SHAWN:
I'm calling the cops.

GUS:
For what? You heard the guy in there. They're never going to come.

SHAWN:
I'm not calling the cops on him. I'm calling the cops on us. Gus, we need this to play out in front of an audience with all the major players in place. (deep voice into phone) Yes. Hello. I'm calling from the McCallum residence. There's an intruder here who simply won't leave. He's claiming to be a psychic that works for your department.

OFFICER: (over phone)
Pardon me?

SHAWN:
Mr. McCallum is enraged, and he wants this handled by the highest authority possible. Please send the chief immediately. (ends call and smiles) Did you really vomit?

INT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, DEN, DAY

MacCALLUM and and EMPLOYEE look out the window as the police enter the driveway.

MacCALLUM:
Who called them?

EMPLOYEE:
I don't know, sir. Maybe the back staff. Those two gentlemen have not left the driveway. Would you like me to send them all away?

MacCALLUM:
No. Let's finish this.

EXT. MacCALLUM RESIDENCE, FRONT DRIVE, DAY

MacCALLUM walks out the front door and into the drive with VICK.

MacCALLUM:
As you can see, Karen, this simply cannot happen.

VICK:
It'll be taken care of. Believe me. He was given clear instructions to stay away.

MacCALLUM:
I understand, but...

LASSITER follows pulling SHAWN along by his arm as his hands are cuffed behind his back. LUCINDA is with

GUS.

LASSITER:
Yeah, it's times like this I remember why I love my job so much.

GUS:
Any time, Shawn.

SHAWN:
He's getting cocky. Give it a sec.

GUS:
We're gonna be in a city jail in a sec.

LASSITER:
Uh-huh. Here we are. (pushes SHAWN into the backseat of the car, hitting his head on the roof) Oh, I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

SHAWN looks at GUS over the car.

SHAWN:
Ah, something's happening! (starts shaking) Gus! Something's happening!

LASSITER:
Stop it!

SHAWN falls to the ground and convulses and groans. Two officers go to help, but Lassiter stops them. Everyone is watching, including VICK and MacCALLUM.

LASSITER:
Wait.

SHAWN:
The dog!

LASSITER:
(stands over SHAWN) Shut up.

SHAWN:
He's biting the intruder! He knows him! It's someone he knows! The dog knows him!

LASSITER:
Stop talking.

SHAWN:
Ouch! Ow! The teeth are digging in.

LASSITER:
Shut up!

SHAWN:
Oh, there's blood!

LASSITER bodily lifts SHAWN and carries him to the car.

SHAWN:
It's him! It's McCallum! I can see his face! The killer is McCallum. Check his wrist! Check his right wrist! The teeth marks will match up!

MacCALLUM:
Get him out of here!

LASSITER is trying to force a resisting SHAWN into the car.

SHAWN:
Check the wrist!

MacCALLUM:
No one is checking any part of me.

VICK:
Why not?

MacCALLUM:
(turns to VICK) Huh?

LASSITER and SHAWN stop struggling.

VICK:
We can close this out immediately. Discredit him right here. That's an awful wound you have bandaged there.

MacCALLUM:
This is outrageous! Do you really want to do this?

VICK:
We could do this now... or I could call in a warrant.

MacCALLUM:
I'll call my lawyer.

VICK:
I'll be right here.

SHAWN:
I see a doctor. I'm seeing a doctor. Dr. Mandali. And a word. Consumine! Yeah, it's for dog bites! The wound is fresh! Check the wound! It's a fresh wound, it's still a fresh wound!

MacCALLUM:
(faces VICK)(stammers) It was an accident. I- I didn't-

LASSITER:
What?

VICK:
Sergeant. (waves police over)

Two police take MacCALLUM into custody.

OFFICER:
Come this way, sir.

GUS:
(to LUCINDA) You want to take these cuffs off of me, please? (she removes ciffs) Thank you.

SHAWN rests against the car and LASSITER leans next to him.

LASSITER:
Seriously... how?

SHAWN:
I wish I knew.

LASSITER makes a face and walks off. GUS comes over and stands next to him.

SHAWN:
Do you think this pretty much ruins my chances with Katarina?

EXT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, DAY

SHAWN runs into the building.

INT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

Inside her office, VICK is speaking with someone. SHAWN just opens the door without preamble.

SHAWN:
There she is.

VICK:
Don't ever walk into my office without knocking.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry. I got excited.

VICK:
(stands and walks over) You know what I'll do to you?

SHAWN:
Yes.

VICK:
You do?

SHAWN:
I'm a psychic.

VICK:
I'm just finishing up in here. I'll be with you in a moment.

SHAWN puts his hands up and starts to back out of the office.

HENRY:
That's all right, Karen. (stands) I've gotta get going anyway.

VICK:
(shakes HENRY'S hand) Thank you very much for coming down. You've been a big help.

HENRY:
Yeah. Okay. (passes SHAWN on his way out) Son.

SHAWN:
Dad. (watches HENRY leave then looks at VICK)

VICK:
Have a seat.

SHAWN enters and sits down in the chair HENRY vacated.

VICK:
(sits) I was considering adding you to my speed dial, mr. Spencer, but I would be remiss if I didn't do a little background check, don't you think? (puts feet up on desk)

SHAWN:
(sighs) Yes.

VICK:
I asked your dad how long you've had the gift.

SHAWN:
Look, my father's memory is pretty cloudy.

VICK:
Oh, it certainly is. His recollection doesn't match up with your assertion at all.

SHAWN:
I can explain that.

VICK:
You said you've had this ability your whole life.

SHAWN:
Well, whole life. I mean, it's a bit of a gray area.

VICK:
He said you didn't get it until you were 18.

SHAWN:
He said that? Wow, that is just like him. The man simply refuses to acknowledge my abilities, my gifts. Can we discuss my fee?

VICK:
There's a check in the cage.

Excited, SHAWN gets up and heads for the door. VICK lowers her feet and sits up.

VICK:
Sign for it and then come back in.

SHAWN:
Come-come back in here? Why?

VICK:
(hands him a file) You familiar with a chop shop in Summerland?

EXT. SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT, DAY

HENRY is getting into his pickup when SHAWN runs up to him.

SHAWN:
Dad!

HENRY:
So are you gonna continue with this little charade?

SHAWN:
Well, it sort of gives me carte blanche, you know. I mean, I can work cases for the department. I can do private jobs. In fact, I've already got another case.

HENRY:
Be aware. This is the last time I cover for you, pal. (gets into truck) I'm not okay with this, Shawn, any of it.

In the passenger seat, SHAWN sees an article about the case with his photo and smiles.

SHAWN:
I don't expect you to be, Dad.

HENRY drives away and SHAWN gives him a little wave before walking to his motorcycle.

EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET, DAY

SHAWN drives GUS' car along the road by the shore and pulls into a parking space.

SHAWN:
Awesome!

Painted on the window of the building is "Pysch, Private Psychic Detective". They get out of the car and SHAWN throws his arms wide open.

GUS:
Psych? As in, "gotcha".

SHAWN:
Or as in "psychic".

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

The office is bare with only a few chairs, file cabinet, and a desk.

GUS:
You named your fake detective agency Psych? Why don't you just call it, "Hey, we're fooling you and the police department. Hope we don't make a mistake and someone dies because of it".

SHAWN:
First of all, Gus, that name is entirely too long, it would never fit on the window. And secondly, the best way to convince people you're not lying to them is to tell them you are!

GUS:
Whatever, Shawn. It's your agency. Go for it.

SHAWN:
(sits behind desk) Actually, it's our agency. (opens folder and points) I put your name on the lease as well. Tell me, does that look anything like your signature? I gave it a shot.

GUS:
(walks over) This better be a joke.

SHAWN:
Don't worry, you won't have to do a thing. I have worked out every last detail.

GUS:
What's your dental plan?

SHAWN:
Don't get cavities.

GUS:
Health plan?

SHAWN:
Same, but with hepatitis and shingles.

GUS:
So I'm supposed to quit my job, skip over, and do this for no guaranteed money.

SHAWN:
No guaranteed money, but all guaranteed fun!

GUS:
No! No more cases, Shawn. It was fun for a few days. (walks back to window)

SHAWN:
Well, it's gonna have to be fun for a minimum of six months, or we'll have to pay a lease penalty, which would be a blemish on your otherwise very impressive credit report.

GUS:
You solved one mystery and now you renting office space?

SHAWN:
Gus, I've solved a bunch of mysteries. For instance, the mystery of who kept stealing your newspaper. Answer: me! The mystery of what we're doing this weekend. Hint, it involves dragsters. And finally, the mystery that is the case the Chief just brought me in on.

GUS:
You got another case already?

SHAWN:
A car thief got poisoned by his boss. He used something over the counter. Fizadine. No. Fizaderble. No...

GUS:
Fizadrine?

SHAWN:
That's it!

GUS:
Wow. How'd he do that?

SHAWN:
I'll tell you on the way.

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

They walk back to the car.

GUS:
Just for today, right?

SHAWN:
Absolutely.

They get into the car and drive away.

Episode 1x02 Spellingg Bee

EXT. DINER, DAY

SHAWN buys a newspaper from a vending machine before going inside.

INT. DINER, DAY

SHAWN pulls up short when he sees a blonde sitting at the counter reading a newspaper. He walks up to the counter, puts down the paper and leans over.

SHAWN:
Excuse me, you're in my seat.

BLONDE:
Am I?

SHAWN:
Actually, yes, you are.

BLONDE:
Are you one of those weirdo compulsives who come to the same restaurant, sit in the same chair, and eat the same food every day?

SHAWN:
Uh, no, no, no. I was sitting right there three minutes ago, and then I went outside to get myself a paper. (shows paper)  I ordered the juice, (lifts cup)  and look I made a crawling snake with the straw wrapper. (holds wrapper)  You can finish it if you think you're up to the job.

BLONDE:
I'm sorry. You want me to move?

SHAWN:
Not anymore. (drops wrapper and sits next to her) So, what's up?

BLONDE:
I don't have time to talk.

SHAWN:
But you haven't heard what I'm going to say.

BLONDE:
See, now we've already talked more than I wanted to.

The BLONDE leans over and reaches for her purse, giving SHAWN time to look at its contents. He sees pet hair on her shoes and sleeve as well as a photo of her parents.

SHAWN:
Well, I did give you my seat, you know. I think that gets me one question.

BLONDE:
Listen, diner guy...

SHAWN:
Shawn.

BLONDE:
Shawn. Flattered, really. Very often, I am happy to meet new people, but today, right here, right now, I can't talk.

SHAWN:
I understand. I do. What if I do the talking for both of us?

BLONDE:
Have at it. Do you mind if I read the paper and stare aimlessly out the window while you two talk?

SHAWN:
No. Can I get a name to work with? (sips juice)

BLONDE:
Juliet.

SHAWN:
Well, it's very nice to meet you, Juliet. (girlish) It's nice to meet you, too, Shawn, and I'm sorry about your seat, so lunch is on me. So, what do you do for a living? (normal) I do a little bit of everything. (girlish) Oh, that sounds interesting, and maybe a little bit dangerous. Ooh, I like your jacket. I like it...

JULIET:
Okay, can I stop you there? First off, in your portrayal of me, I sound like I'm in the eighth grade.

SHAWN:
Well, in my portrayal of you, you only have an eighth grade education. All right, smarten you up. College? Yeah? Top of your class, graduated early... got it. (womanly) I'm new to town and I don't know many people... but I do know my cats. Two of them. The gray one is very affectionate. The white one makes me work much, much harder for the attention. (regular) And what about your family? (womanly) My family's amazing. My parents have been together for, what is it, 30 years now?

JULIET:
Okay, do we know each other?

SHAWN:
Yes, you are the girl who stole my seat.

The door opens and a tall MAN wearing a torn grey sweatshirt, jeans and a baseball cap enters JULIET'S smile fades. She looks over her shoulder and puts her right hand on her purse before looking back at her newspaper.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Oh, my gosh. You're a cop.

JULIET:
I'm not a cop.

SHAWN:
The paper, the vantage point, the layout. of course. You got defensive when scary guy walked in. You're totally a cop.

JULIET:
Okay, Shawn, I'm going to need you to do me a favor.

SHAWN:
Name it.

JULIET:
Duck.

SHAWN ducks as JULIET pulls a gun from her purse. Two undercover officers rush the MAN and push him down against the countertop.

OFFICER:
Police! Don't move!

LASSITER enters with another officer, guns drawn.

LASSITER:
Gun!

OFFICER 2:
Go!

LASSITER takes the MAN'S gun. JULIET'S hands shake as she holds her gun.

MAN:
Let me go...

LASSITER:
Get him up.

The officers take the MAN away. JULIET lowers her gun. As LASSITER puts his gun in his holster, he looks over and sees SHAWN. SHAWN gives him a little wave and LASSITER hurries out. JULIET goes back to her seat and put her gun in her purse.

SHAWN:
(sips juice) First time pulling your gun?

JULIET:
Maybe. (zips purse and leaves)

SHAWN watches her leave with a smile.

INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM, DAY

A spelling bee is underway and GUS is one of five students left. He is standing front and center.

MODERATOR:
30 seconds, Mr. Guster.

GUS:
A... G... G...

SHAWN is in the audience coaching GUS.

GUS:
Let me start over. "Aggiornamento". A... G... G... (looks at SHAWN) O?

The MODERATOR buzzes GUS out. GUS raises his hands in disgust and walks off the stage.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS is sitting in the office watching the National Spelling Bee semifinals on TV.

ANNOUNCER:
Beautiful Santa Barbara, California, is the backdrop for this afternoon's coverage of the American spelling bee, being held at the downtown Cabrillo Theater. Champions from all over these Western United States have made the trek to test...

GUS turns off the TV and stands and walks back to his desk as SHAWN enters the office on his bicycle.

SHAWN:
What are you watching?

GUS:
Nothing.

SHAWN:
Is that Korean porn? Come on, man. (puts bike against the wall)

GUS:
It's the regional finals of the American... spelling bee.

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
Don't mock me. It's a huge event.

SHAWN:
No, I'm just... I'm shocked that you didn't take the whole day off.

GUS:
It's on Sportscal2, for your information, and it's hosted by Bud Collins.

SHAWN:
Really? Did they... did they bump the car washing championships for this? And is it over soon? 'Cause I'd like to get back to the woodcarving finals.

GUS ignores SHAWN and walks over and turns the TV back on.

ANNOUNCER:
Let's recap this morning's unexpected high drama...

GUS:
It's being held in Santa Barbara this year, down at the Cabrillo. It's huge. Sold out.

ANNOUNCER:
All the experts are shaking their heads.

GUS:
I tried to get tickets, but you got to know somebody.

SHAWN:
Somebody lame. Dude, I can't believe you're watching that. (walks to his desk)

GUS:
I'm taping it, and I don't care what you think, Shawn. I watch the bee semis every year.

SHAWN:
Okay, for your sake and mine, stop giving the spelling bee hip little nicknames.

GUS shushes SHAWN.

COLLINS:
For those of you who have just joined us, well, a bit of a shock... and a little sad, too. The heavy favorite has had a bad spell, and Brendan Vu is out.

GUS:
What?

ANNOUNCER:
Boo-hoo for Vu, Bud.

GUS:
No way. Brendan Vu is out? Already?

SHAWN:
Okay, now you're just scaring me.

GUS:
Come on, Shawn. He took second last year. Everybody knows that.

SHAWN:
No, Gus, nobody knows that, except for Brendan and his mother.

GUS:
Okay.

COLLINS:
We're going to show this again. (tv shows replay) It looks like young Mr. Vu may be having trouble breathing.

SHAWN looks up from the mail to watch.

ANNOUNCER:
He does look to be under some sort of duress, Bud. His inhaler did not appear to help and Vu tumbled to the floor...

GUS:
Dang!

ANNOUNCER:
Paramedics rushed to the scene, and within moments, the competition had taken an unexpected turn.

SHAWN walks over and picks up the remote.

SHAWN:
Wait a second. Did you see that?

SHAWN rewinds the footage and pauses it to look at the inhaler.

SHAWN:
This is no accident. There's something wrong with that inhaler.

GUS:
Shawn, get out of here. (takes back the remote and starts it again)

ANNOUNCER:
For 35 minutes, competition was suspended.

The phone rings and SHAWN answers it.

SHAWN:
Psych.

ANNOUNCER:
...and Vu and his family were rushed to the hospital.

SHAWN:
(puts hand over phone) (to GUS) It's the chief. (into phone) Well, I'll have to check with Gus. (to GUS) Are we available? (into phone) It appears we are. We'll be right there. (hangs up)

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I can get us into the spelling bee.

GUS:
Really?

SHAWN:
Guess I was right about the whole Bandon Dunes thing.

GUS:
Brendan Vu.

SHAWN:
Sure.

GUS:
They need a psychic detective for that?

SHAWN:
They don't... unless he was sabotaged. The kid said his inhaler felt funny. When he used it, his hand stung. The paramedics get there, there's no inhaler. Apparently, the thing just vanished into thin air...

While SHAWN is talking, GUS hurries to his desk and grabs his jacket.

GUS:
Shawn, we are so taking this. Let's go. (heads out the door)

SHAWN:
How come I can't get you this excited about girls?

GUS:
Let's go, Shawn!

SHAWN:
Or Mexico?

EXT. CABRILLO THEATRE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS get out of the car and meet VICK as she leaves the building.

SHAWN:
We're here.

VICK:
Go on in, Mr. Spencer. I've arranged everything you need inside.

SHAWN:
You're leaving?

VICK:
I was only here for the mayor's presentation and we have a robbery standoff across town.

SHAWN:
Shouldn't I go to the hospital, meet the victim, get a statement?

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, the case is sabotage. There are 43 remaining contestants, all presumably, with a motive. Now, you can read guilt just by talking with someone, right? Do it.

SHAWN:
Do you want us to talk to all of them?

VICK:
And their parents.

GUS:
Today?

VICK:
By 5:00. In two days, this whole thing is over. At that time, all the witnesses will be in a hundred different cities all over the western United States, so it's now or never. Good luck. (walks to her car)

GUS slaps SHAWN on the back and heads into the theatre, smiling. SHAWN follows reluctantly.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, MAIN THEATRE, DAY

COLLINS:
Spellmaster Elvin Cavanaugh is a secretive guy, and yet he has called for a press conference after this round.

GIRL:
Can you repeat that, please?

CAVANAUGH:
"Butyraceous".

GIRL:
Definition, please?

CAVANAUGH:
Adjective. Having the characteristics of butter.

GUS and SHAWN walk down to the front row.

GUS:
This thing's been sold out for weeks.

SHAWN:
I can see why. It moves so fast. It's like hockey with words.

GUS points to the room at the upper level from where CAVANAUGH gives the words.

GUS:
That's Elvin Cavanaugh, the greatest spell champion ever. He's been the Spellmaster for 14 years. He's a legend.

They sit.

SHAWN:
Wow. He sits up there all by himself in that fancy box? What is he, the phantom of the opera?

GUS:
He's a huge celebrity. He can't just sit in the crowd.

GIRL:
Can you repeat the word?

CAVANAUGH:
"Butyraceous".

GIRL:
"Butyraceous"?

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, dude. You're not bored at all?

GUS:
Do you know how to spell any of these words?

SHAWN:
Proudly, I've never heard of any of these words. I file these words under "things to say when I want to be ridiculed or kicked out of bed".

GUS:
See, the problem is that"butyraceous"  is clearly a round one word.

SHAWN:
Oh, God, stop talking. I'd like to pretend we still have things in common, Gus.

GUS:
Well, instead of sitting here, maybe we should get to work.

GUS gets up and walks through the exit door. SHAWN gets up and follows.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, PROP ROOM

MRS. FOOTE escorts them into the prop room that has been set up as a comfort room.

FOOTE:
Try not to break anything.

GUS:
So this is what it looks like.

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
The comfort room. This is where you go to deal with missing a word.

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah? Where do they take you to deal with missing your entire childhood?

GUS:
Shawn, this misplaced malevolence you have with the spelling bee is getting monotonous. Stop hating on the bee. I'm sorry, ma'am. I do apologize for his inappropriate virulence.

SHAWN:
Why are you using all these big-ass words all of a sudden?

GUS:
I'm not doing that. That's preposterous. I was in the spelling bee myself. I almost won.

SHAWN:
Are you still on that?

GUS:
Of course I'm still on it. I knew it wasn't "o".

FOOTE:
You may have five minutes with each contestant, no more. If the room is needed, you will be asked to vacate. I'll begin with the eliminated contestants.

SHAWN:
Um, actually, we'd only like to speak with the ones that were still in the competition when the accident occurred...  (reads nametag) Ms... Foote... and, let's start with the shifty-eyed ones, shall we?

FOOTE rolls her eyes and leaves. Sometime later, the boys are questioning a young Indian BOY and his mother.

SHAWN:
And you were there the whole time?

BOY:
I was.

MOTHER:
"Assimilation".

BOY:
A-s-s-i-m-i-l-a-t-i-o-n. "Assimilation".

SHAWN holds up his hands in disbelief. The next in is a Czech boy, JIRI, and his father MIKLOS

MIKLOS:
My son... no one expect him to come this far, but he surprise everyone. You watch him win.

SHAWN:
Oh, I don't know. Are they running odds on this thing now? Because I got some cash I'd like to lay down on the really, really tall girl with the bulldog underbite. What, is she on stilts? (laughs)

MIKLOS:
You do not understand. This contest, it is money for scholarship. It is entry into any school in the future.

GUS:
Yeah, Shawn. The winner of this competition can just about choose his university.

MIKLOS:
Your friend is right.

GUS:
And it teaches grace under pressure, poise, dignity...

SHAWN:
All things you can get at a hot dog eating competition. Plus... hot dogs.

JIRI smiles shyly. Next in is GIRL #2 and her MOTHER. GIRL #2 has a book open on her lap.

SHAWN:
Still studying, huh?

MOTHER:
Oh, she loves it. Won't put that thing down.

SHAWN:
Well, kudos on the child-rearing. Let me know how the therapy goes.

MOTHER:
Huh?

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, BROADCAST BOOTH

COLLINS:
We're going to keep rolling because of the exceptional request by Elvin Cavanaugh, behind-the-scenes guy, to give a press conference right here at this stage of the competition. What's that all about?

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, MAIN THEATRE, DAY

The broadcast continues on monitors as GUS and SHAWN return to the theatre.

ANNOUNCER:
Well, I mean, this could be something big, Bud. I mean, this year's competition has just been peppered with controversy.

COLLINS:
It certainly has. Well, he's been watching from a private box on the balcony, but now

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, BROADCAST BOOTH

COLLINS:
he's going to come out so that we can see him.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, MAIN THEATRE, DAY

CAVANAUGH stands with a grunt and puts a hand on the railing.

ANNOUNCER:
This could be something big, Bud.

CAVANAUGH is red-faced and is holding one hand over his stomach.

COLLINS:
I think he's having difficulty breathing.

CAVANAUGH now has both hands on the railing.

ANNOUNCER:
He does look under duress, Bud.

At that moment, CAVANAUGH falls over the rail and plummets to the floor. There are screams and exclamations. People rush to the body to see if there's anything to be done.

SHAWN:
Okay, not to belittle this guy's life, but this just got more interesting than the woodcarving finals.

LATER>>>

JULIET watches as two men from the coroner's office take the body away. She then walks over to LASSITER.

JULIET:
When do we decide if we should cancel this event?

LASSITER:
Why would we cancel?

JULIET:
Well, a body did just tumble into the crowd.

LASSITER:
It didn't land on anybody. (eats popcorn)

JULIET:
It might be traumatic.

LASSITER:
For who? The mayor, when he realizes all the hotel rooms are now empty?

JULIET:
We could postpone at least a day. I'm sure that's allowed.

LASSITER:
Do you have any idea how important this event is to the city? No, unhealthy guy has heart attack, falls over railing. Case closed. I'm certainly not declaring it a crime scene. Come on. You can introduce me to the press.

JULIET:
Okay. Just be sensitive.

LASSITER:
How about if we don't sell the seat the guy landed on?

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, BALCONY, DAY

SHAWN and GUS arrive on the balcony to check out the scene but are met by a security GUARD.

GUARD:
Uh, can I help you?

SHAWN:
Has anyone come out of there?

GUARD:
Just the cops. I've been here the whole time.

SHAWN:
Did you hear anything from in there?

GUARD:
I'm sorry... who are you?

SHAWN:
Uh, I'm Shawn Spencer. I'm a psychic with the police department.

GUARD:
I'm sorry, Mr. Spencer. Look, I don't doubt your ability, I actually have an aunt who could see apparitions, and some spooky stuff. But they told me not to let anybody in here without a badge, so...

SHAWN:
I see. Okay. As long as you feel safe. (turns to leave)

GUARD:
S... safe?

SHAWN:
What with the dead guy's spirit being here, and him being so angry...

GUARD:
How angry?

SHAWN:
Well, considering he might have just been murdered, that's... I mean, that's definitely a negative. (laughs) Man, I wouldn't be happy.

GUS and the GUARD laugh with him. SHAWN suddenly shrieks and raises his arms as he falls back against the wall.

SHAWN:
No, please! Spare me! I'm here to help you! Gus! Back me up here!

SHAWN'S hands go around his throat as he chokes and convulses. The GUARD backs away from SHAWN who starts to speak gibberish. He then falls to the ground and rolls down the stairs where he lands on his stomach.

GUARD:
(stammers) Y... you guys just take a quick little look-see, okay? I'll be downstairs. (runs out)

GUS goes down to SHAWN

GUS:
Come on, get up.

SHAWN gets up with a groan and they enter the box.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, BOX, DAY

SHAWN looks at the messy desk.

SHAWN:
Well... we certainly know what his vice was. (holds a donut between his fingers)

GUS:
He was a heavy eater. So what?

SHAWN:
Nothing. I'm just thinking Lassiter's heart attack theory might not be so far off. (sees a notation jotted in margin) Who's contestant 1-9-5-3?

GUS:
It only goes up to 200-something.

SHAWN uses a pencil to turn the page and sees "1953" written in the margin again.

SHAWN:
What does 1-9-5-3 mean?

GUS:
Nothing. Is it a rule?

SHAWN:
No, they don't really number the rules like that.

SHAWN sees the chair is tipped over as is a potted plant and pencil holder on the desk.

GUS:
Think there was an altercation?

SHAWN:
No, something else. He was all by himself up here.

GUS:
You smell that?

SHAWN:
Dude, don't look at me.

GUS:
It's sulfuric. (sniffs)

SHAWN:
Gus, I am not the one who had the egg salad.

GUS:
No, no, no. We manufactured something last year, heavy stuff. When it started to go bad, it smelled the same. You could pick out a bottle across the warehouse. (leans over the desk and sniffs)

SHAWN:
I can't smell anything.

GUS:
Well, you don't have the supersmeller.

SHAWN:
(rolls eyes) Gus, you have got to stop calling your nose "the supersmeller". If you want to nickname a body part, nickname your butt, man! Call it "the tight bouncer", or "the hexagon". Ladies are going to dig that, I'm telling you.

GUS finds a Chinese takeaway on the floor. He stands.

GUS:
It's there. It's right there. It's subtle, but it's right there.

SHAWN:
Well, what is it?

GUS:
I don't know. It's nothing we manufactured.

SHAWN:
Aren't you supposed to know this kind of stuff?

GUS:
I sell pharmaceutical supplies. I'm not a scientist.

SHAWN:
But you're saying it is something.

GUS:
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

SHAWN reaches down and picks up the box and uses the chopsticks.

GUS:
Don't eat it.

SHAWN:
Dude, do I look like an idiot?

SHAWN takes an evidence bag from his back pocket and slips some of the food inside.

GUS:
What are you... you're taking some to go?

SHAWN:
Yes! For the road! In case later on I get hungry enough to eat something that might be poisoned!

Down on the main floor, LASSITER approaches the GUARD. GUS ducks and pulls SHAWN down. The GUARD points up to the box.

GUARD:
There are four up there, and two on the other side...

LASSITER:
What, you mean those two guys up there?

JULIET:
Excuse me. Hi. It's time. The press are ready.

LASSITER:
(to GUARD) Thank you.

GUARD:
All right.

SHAWN:
Man, we got to go.

Staying low, SHAWN and GUS leave the box.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, MAIN THEATRE, DAY

LASSITER is being questioned by the press, JULIET stands next to him.

LASSITER:
Sorry, could I just try that again? I kind of fumbled the "safe and secure" part.

REPORTER:
Sure.

JULIET:
(whispers) Be sensitive.

LASSITER:
(whispers) Of course. (to press) The finals will continue tomorrow as scheduled. At this point, all indications are that Mr. Cavanaugh was having a heart attack, stumbled forward, falling over the railing to his death, but we want to assure everyone that this building is both safe and...

JULIET:
(cuts in) Our sympathies go out to Mr. Cavanaugh's family, and we would like to offer counseling to anyone who feels they might need it.

SHAWN and GUS have made their way down and watch.

GUS:
Who's the blonde?

SHAWN:
Lassiter's new partner. They transferred his girlfriend.

LASSITER:
And again, we want to assure everyone coming out for this fantastic event that it is entirely safe.

GUS:
Shawn, they're going to stop investigating.

LASSITER:
One last question, and I really have to go wrap up the scene.

GUS:
(jabs SHAWN) Do something.

REPORTER:
Is there any word as to what Cavanaugh's big announcement was?

SHAWN:
(puts hand to head) Moo goo gai pan!

The reporters turn their attention - and camera's to SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Beef lo mein! Kung pao! (groans) Check the food! It was murder! Oh, did I just say all of that out loud?

EXT. CABRILLO THEATRE, DAY

SHAWN is trying to study the contents of the bag.

GUS:
Shawn, you'll never find out what that is without a lab.

SHAWN:
I'll get a lab.

GUS:
A high-tech lab? Right now?

SHAWN:
Maybe. I... might have a connection.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, DAY

HENRY is on the front porch gathering his fishing pole and tackle box.

SHAWN:
Yo!

HENRY:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
Hey, Dad. Great shirt.

HENRY:
(sighs) You want something.

SHAWN:
Why do you always think I want something?

HENRY:
Oh, you don't want anything. What a pleasant surprise. (goes inside)

SHAWN:
Okay, you got me. I want something.

HENRY:
(comes back to the open door) I got a poker game in 45 minutes.

SHAWN:
You still talk to Jim Syklan?

HENRY:
Syklan? Sometimes. Why? What's it to you?

SHAWN:
Is he still working at the regional crime lab out there?

HENRY:
Last I checked. Why?

SHAWN:
I need to know what this is. (holds up evidence bag)

HENRY:
It looks like a number 15 with chicken.

SHAWN:
Dad, you made a joke! I think there's poison in it.

HENRY:
Goodbye, Shawn.(goes inside and closes sliding door)

SHAWN:
(groans in frustration and runs to the window) It's just one time. Once.

HENRY:
No cases, Shawn. I was painfully clear about that.

SHAWN:
Oh, no, no. This isn't for a case. This is... for a friend.

HENRY:
Oh, friend, different. No! (closes curtains)

HENRY leaves by the door.

SHAWN:
Look, I'll do anything. Whatever you want. It's one favor. Anything he can tell me about this would be very helpful. It's serious.

HENRY:
Shawn, this is really important to you?

SHAWN:
Extremely.

HENRY:
And you'll do anything?

SHAWN:
Name it.

HENRY smiles.

EXT. HENRY'S GARAGE, DAY

SHAWN is standing outside as HENRY carries out something covered by a tarp.

HENRY:
(chuckles) Grab a saw.

SHAWN:
What, now? (goes into garage)

GUS:
(sets down item) Well, you said you'd do anything, right?

SHAWN:
(comes out with saw) You know, most people will wait five, six whole minutes before they cash in a favor. I will not saw through bone for you.

HENRY chuckles and removes the tarp to reveal a terrible, unfinished DIY project.

SHAWN:
The doghouse? From eighth grade?

HENRY:
It's not really a doghouse. (kicks it) Not yet.

SHAWN:
What do you want me to do?

HENRY:
Finish it.

SHAWN:
What, now?

HENRY:
Or whenever you want your information. (heads towards pickup) You got more wood out back, nails on the workbench, Home Depot's open till 9:00. Don't cut any corners. (gets in truck)

SHAWN:
You're insane!

HENRY:
You're losing light. Make sure you lock up. (drives off with a wave)

SHAWN:
It's creepy that you kept this! (looks down at "doghouse")

**********************************************************************
FLASHBACK

EXT. PARK, DAY

By a pond, a boy plays with a puppy. SHAWN and HENRY are off to the side.

HENRY:
Shawn, you've done absolutely nothing to convince me that you're responsible enough to have a dog.

SHAWN:
You'll never give me a chance.

HENRY:
Chances are earned, Shawn.

SHAWN:
You'll never let me earn it.

HENRY:
Fair enough. You're going to need a doghouse.

SHAWN:
I saw one at the hardware store...

HENRY:
No, no, no, no. You're going to make it.

SHAWN:
I can't.

HENRY:
Well, it seems to me that somebody who thinks they're responsible enough for the life of an animal should certainly be able to construct a roof for the ratty little... thing.

SHAWN:
All right. I'll make it. I'll make it right now. (leaves)

**********************************************************************

EXT. HENRY'S GARAGE, NIGHT

It's dark when HENRY returns home and SHAWN has put together the bare bones of a rudimentary doghouse. He is holding a hammer in one hand and a slice of pineapple in the other. HENRY gets out of his truck and looks at it.

HENRY:
What is that?

SHAWN:
"What is that"? It's the doghouse.

HENRY:
No, it's not.

SHAWN:
What are you talking about?

HENRY:
I gave you specifications.

SHAWN:
When?

HENRY:
When I gave you the job.

SHAWN:
In 1989?

HENRY:
Shawn, you know as well as I do this is not what I asked for. Keep working. And don't be too loud. The neighbors are trying to sleep.

HENRY goes inside and SHAWN raises the hammer in frustration. He then looks down at the doghouse and kicks it lightly, causing it to fall apart. SHAWN then throws the tools down.

EXT. ROAD, NIGHT

SHAWN is driving down the empty road on his motorcycle. He flashes back to 1989.

**********************************************************************

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN is working on the doghouse in the yard, nailing on the roof. HENRY comes home.

HENRY:
(chuckles) You expect me to be okay with this?

SHAWN:
I worked hard on it.

HENRY:
Shawn, you've been at this for hours now. The nails aren't pounded in all the way, the base has got to be up off the ground. If it rains, the rain's gonna flow right in. And who's going to fit in through that door there? That door's not high enough.

SHAWN:
I built it, Dad. What do you want me to do?

HENRY:
I want you to do it right. (goes inside)

**********************************************************************

As SHAWN in going down the road, a van coming in the opposite direction blinds him with its headlights. It comes at him, and SHAWN swerves to miss it. The motorcycle hits the curb and SHAWN flies into the grass on the side of the road. The van drives off as SHAWN sits up.

INT. RESTAURANT, DAY

GUS is sitting at a table talking on the phone with a client.

GUS:
Listen, Dr. Sloane, if I can get you this product this afternoon, would it be possible to sit down with you to discuss the, uh...

The TV is showing the bee and JIRI is spelling.

JIRI:
M... A...

GUS:
The unbelievable results we've been... having with...

JIRI:
O...

GUS sees the name on JIRI'S inhaler, Dr. Zavin.

GUS:
I'm sorry. Can I call you back? Thanks.

GUS writes the name down just as his cell rings.

GUS:
Burton Guster. Shawn? You're in the hospital? What happened? (motions for his check)

INT. HOSPITAL, HALL, DAY

SHAWN is limping down the hall, a brace over his knee. GUS is with him. SHAWN is unwrapping a bandage from his wrist and hand.

GUS:
You call your dad?

SHAWN:
I'm fine. They're releasing me.

GUS:
Did you call him?

SHAWN:
(looks through door) Gus, I'm not going to talk to my dad.

GUS:
He'd want to know you're okay.

SHAWN:
(throws away bandage) All he cares about are results, just like those possessed spelling bee parents. (looks through another door) You know what's wrong with this? All of this. (grimaces)

GUS:
Shawn, you're delirious. You're upset. You lost control of your bike last night.

SHAWN:
(stops) Gus, I didn't lose control of anything. Someone tried to kill me, or send a very serious message. (continues)

INT. HOSPITAL, BRENDAN VU'S ROOM, DAY

BRENDAN is in bed, his MOTHER standing beside the bed, his father sitting in a chair. The room is filled with balloons, cards and flowers.

MOTHER:
Brendan appreciates you checking on him.

SHAWN:
Well, we were in the neighborhood, and Gus here is a huge fan. He almost won the spelling bee himself.

GUS:
I took some bad advice.

SHAWN sees BRENDAN'S inhaler and the name of the doctor: Seymour.

MOTHER:
Well, Brendan's going home tomorrow. He's fine. He's more upset about missing the spelling bee.

SHAWN:
Well, maybe they'll decide to redo the whole thing.

BRENDAN:
Why would they do that?

INT. HOSPITAL, HALL, DAY

SHAWN:
Did you see the inhaler?

GUS:
Same one as that little Czech kid?

SHAWN:
Get me a seating chart. I'll bet you I know who Brendan was sitting next to on day one.

GUS:
Already checked it out.

SHAWN:
Nice.

GUS:
Shawn, something's going on with that Czech kid.

SHAWN:
Talk to me.

GUS:
The doctor on his inhaler, Dr. Zavin in Ventura?

SHAWN:
Yeah?

GUS:
He doesn't exist. I do training on that route. The last doctor in the book is Youngerman. I double-checked it today.

SHAWN:
You're saying that inhaler...

GUS:
is a fake.

SHAWN laughs and walks away.

GUS:
Where are you going?

SHAWN:
I... am going to build a doghouse.

SHAWN limps down the hallway.

EXT. HENRY'S GARAGE, DAY

SHAWN is working on the doghouse as HENRY comes out, a cup of coffee in his hand. SHAWN has his leg stretched out to the side.

HENRY:
I thought you gave up.

SHAWN:
Yeah, well, it doesn't appear so.

HENRY:
What happened to your leg?

SHAWN:
Absolutely nothing.

HENRY:
You're running your roofing vertical there, huh?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

HENRY:
Well, you might want to pop a ridge beam in first.

SHAWN:
Well, yeah, that's... that's a given.

HENRY shakes his head and walks away. SHAWN throws down the wood he had been lining up and the combination square. HENRY returns with a piece of wood to use as the ridge beam.

SHAWN:
What the hell are you doing?

HENRY:
I'm going to help you.

SHAWN:
You've never helped me before, ever.

HENRY:
You've never asked. (taps a spot) Put a nail in here.

SHAWN:
(picks up hammer and nail) All right. This is weird. (hammers nail)

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

HENRY pulls a beer from the fridge for himself and offers one to SHAWN.

SHAWN:
No thanks.

HENRY closes the fridge and joins SHAWN by the kitchen window where he is looking at the completed doghouse.

HENRY:
Not bad. (pats him on the back and walks away)

SHAWN:
"Not bad"? (follows HENRY) It's like the Park Hyatt for poodles. Will you call Jack Syklan?

HENRY holds up a file.

SHAWN:
What is this?

HENRY:
Your results. We had an agreement.

SHAWN reaches for the file but HENRY jerks it back.

HENRY:
This is a derivative of methyl parathion. High-grade stuff. Whatever you're into, I want you to get out quick. I'm not kidding.

HENRY gives SHAWN the file and sits at the table. SHAWN opens it and starts to read.

SHAWN:
Wait a second. How did you get this so quickly?

HENRY:
Hmm? Oh, Syklan's a part of my poker game.

SHAWN:
So you didn't even have to call him?

HENRY:
(shrugs)The game was at his house. (opens beer)

SHAWN:
And I did all of that for nothing?

GUS:
For nothing? You've never completed a thing in your life. Now you have.

SHAWN is angry beyond words even though he tries. He storms out.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is sitting in front of VICK'S desk. VICK is standing behind it. GUS is standing beside SHAWN and LASSITER and JULIET stand to the side.

VICK:
Poisoned?

SHAWN:
(having a "vision") I feel somebody poisoned his food. There is a... Styrofoam container...yes, and a...(groans) "Happiness is a golden poem". What? (imitates cracking) Fortune cookie.

LASSITER:
This is ridiculous.

JULIET:
Is it?

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, what we have now points to a medical condition, not murder. All appearances show Mr. Cavanaugh having an anaphylactic reaction.

GUS:
Not to be out of line, but that could be triggered by several types of poisons, or altered medications.

LASSITER:
Or shellfish, which he was allergic to.

VICK:
(sits) Those results will show up in the toxicology report, which we will have a copy of in approximately two weeks.

SHAWN:
No, no, no! That'll be too late. (stands) All the contestants will have gone...(winces) Home. You won't be able to finish a real investigation. (puts hand to temple) Chief, I...I sense this. Something got out of control, and the perpetrator was willing to kill to cover it up.

VICK:
What proof do you have?

SHAWN:
(hesitates) Only what I feel.

LASSITER:
Why are you still listening to this crap?

SHAWN:
Dude, what is your glitch?

LASSITER:
You. You're my "glitch". (to VICK) Look, he got nowhere with his little inhaler assignment, and then he tells the media that we had a murder scene! Cut him loose, Karen! (she glares at him) I mean, do whatever you think is best...Chief.

GUS:
Mr. Cavanaugh was going to make an announcement. What about that?

JULIET:
The Director said he'd spoken of retiring.

SHAWN:
That's not what he was going to say.

LASSITER:
Oh, you know?

SHAWN:
I know.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, I asked you to check in about the inhaler incident. (stands) If you or your partner have anything about that, I'd be happy to hear about it. Otherwise...

GUS and SHAWN look at each other.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS leave VICK'S office and walk towards the exit.

SHAWN:
We've got to get back into the Spellmaster's room.

GUS:
You're serious?

SHAWN:
Gus, the killer was there. There's got to be some other piece of evidence inside.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk towards the fire exit.

GUS:
We're not going to have time to get in there. Besides, it's locked.

SHAWN:
We'll make it work. Whoa, whoa, whoa. How hard is it to get into this event without a ticket?

The fire exit door is open and there is a jacket hung on the handle.

GUS:
Impossible.

SHAWN sees the nametag on the jacket: Bill FINEMAN, Spellmaster.

SHAWN:
The new spellmaster. Check it out.

FINEMAN is having a smoke.

SHAWN:
That's exactly what I was hoping you'd say. (grabs jacket and closes door)

GUS:
You can't do that to him.

SHAWN:
Gus, he has to learn sometime that smoking is bad for him. (leaves)

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, MAIN THEATRE, DAY

ANNOUNCER:
We're picking it up as a new round commences. A lot of excitement in the air.

COLLINS:
Oh, yeah.

ANNOUNCER:
The tension is becoming butyraceous, Bud.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, BALCONY, DAY

SHAWN, wearing the Spellmaster jacket, limps over to the door and unlocks it with keys from the jacket pocket.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, BOX, DAY

SHAWN walks in, bumps his bad leg into the desk and groans in pain as he falls to the floor. GUS shushes him as he closes the door.

SHAWN:
I'm so sorry if my agonizing pain is inconveniencing you. (sees three uniform indentations in the carpet) What's this?

GUS:
It's a mark on the carpet. Let's go. Someone must have heard that.

DIRECTOR: (over intercom)
30 seconds, live to air. Positions, please.

GUS:
Time's up, Shawn.

SHAWN gets up and heads to the closet.

GUS:
Did you hear me, Shawn?

SHAWN opens the closet as GUS looks outside.

SHAWN:
I've got something. (comes out with a camera and tripod and sets it on the marks) Yes. (the camera is facing backwards)

DIRECTOR: (over intercom)
10 seconds. Prepare the next word.

SHAWN:
That can't be right.

GUS:
It doesn't mean anything, Shawn. Let's go.

DIRECTOR: (over intercom)
Broadcast in five, four, three, two...

SHAWN:
(turns the camera) Maybe this direction.

DIRECTOR: (over intercom)
Hello? We need the word now.

This new angle for the camera has it facing a wall.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, MAIN THEATRE, DAY

The audience looks up towards the balcony, as does the GIRL onstage, waiting for her word.

DIRECTOR: (over intercom)
Is everything okay? Leann, something's wrong. Send security.

SHAWN looks at GUS before leaning over and speaking into the intercom.

SHAWN:
Uh, no. Sorry for the delay. (to GUS) Give me a word.

GUS:
A word?

SHAWN:
Yeah. Something hard, but something you can spell.

GUS:
I can spell anything.

SHAWN:
Except "aggiornamento". Give me one.

GUS:
No. You are not going to be spellmaster.

SHAWN:
Gus, give me a word so we can get out of here. We're so close.

GUS just looks at him.

DIRECTOR: (over intercom)
Is everything okay up there?

SHAWN: (into mic)
It's fine. "Banana".

GIRL:
Can you repeat that?

SHAWN: (into mic)
Yes. Ba-na-na.

GUS:
"Banana", Shawn? This is the third round.

SHAWN:
You could've helped me.

GUS:
This is a dead end. We're walking. Let's go.

They stand and SHAWN turns the tripod one more time.

GIRL:
Definition, please?

SHAWN:
What? (limps back to the mic) A yellow fruit. Also a kind of pudding. A delicious pudding. (stands and goes back to camera)

GIRL:
Sentence, please?

SHAWN:
(hisses in frustration and heads back to the mic) "Anna banana would like to hear 'Venus' by Bananarama". "Banana". (moves back to camera)

GIRL:
B-a-n-a-n-a. "Banana".

The GIRL goes to sit down and GIRL 2 stands for her turn. SHAWN looks through the camera.

SHAWN:
Oh, wait a second. I've got something!

The camera is looking straight at MIKLOS.

SHAWN:
Dude, we got him! He was watching the Czech.

GUS:
Let me see.

SHAWN stands aside as GUS looks.

DIRECTOR: (over intercom)
We need to get the next word.

SHAWN:
(sighs and sits) Give me a word.

GUS:
No. You're ruining the whole event.

SHAWN:
Suit yourself. (looks at something) (into mic) "Onion".

GUS:
"Onion"?

GIRL 2:
"Onion"?

COLLINS:
"Onion"? Even Dan Quayle could spell that.

GIRL 2:
O-n-i-o-n. "Onion".

The audience applauds as does SHAWN. GUS glares at him.

DIRECTOR: (over intercom)
Are we off the list, Bill?

SHAWN: (into intercom)
Uh, no. Everything's fine.

GUS:
(sees the list SHAWN is using) You're using his grocery list.

SHAWN:
You refused to help me. Now I've got to give them something else. (into mic) "Mitchum".

BOY:
"Mitchum"?

SHAWN:
Yes. "When I go to Albertson's, I need to buy some Mitchum ice blast". "And...bananas. "

GUS only shakes his head.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, LOBBY, DAY

FINEMAN strides past with Security.

FINEMAN:
That wasn't me. I was locked outside. (walks up the stairs past GUS and SHAWN) I have a reputation to uphold.

SHAWN and GUS go down the rest of the stairs, SHAWN leaning heavily on the bannister.

GUS:
So he was watching the Czech. We have no proof. There was no film in the camera.

SHAWN:
He was using that lens for something else besides taking pictures. Now, what?

GUS:
Cavanaugh was known for ferreting out rule-breakers. He once caught a kid stealing the advance word list. And everything he did had a purpose.

They stop at a table that has booklets with information and words from past bees. SHAWN opens one before passing it to GUS.

SHAWN:
You couldn't have grabbed one of these five minutes ago? (walks off)

GUS follows, keeping the booklet.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, MAIN THEATRE, DAY

GUS and SHAWN take two seats on the aisle in the same row as MIKLOS where they have a clear view of him.

ANNOUNCER:
We're down to the final two spellers. This has been a hard-fought battle right from the start. We've had tragedy, controversy, but when it really mattered, these kids put together a fantastic display of the power of learning.

GUS:
(scoffs reading booklet) Look at this. Brendan Vu went down on "gladiolus".

SHAWN:
So?

GUS:
So? If I'd been able see any of the competition, I could've told you that was the winning word from the first spelling bee in 1929.

SHAWN:
Okay, you're scaring me again.

GUS:
All of these words from that round were the winning words. They do that once in a while. They make it a theme round. This one won the 1985 bee, this one from 1943...

SHAWN:
Gus, what are you saying?

GUS:
Guess which kid got the winning word from 1953?

SHAWN:
(mouths)I don't know.

GUS:
(whispers) You're staring at his father.

They look at JIRI onstage at the microphone.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Gus, that's who Cavanaugh was going to disqualify. That's what he was tracking in the rule book. 1-9-5-3. It was 1953.

FINEMAN: (over speakers)
Jiri Prochazka, you have the next word. "Mastoparietal".

MIKLOS opens his dictionary.

JIRI:
P... part of speech?

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, BOX, DAY

FINEMAN:
It is an adjective.

INT. CABRILLO THEATRE, MAIN THEATRE, DAY

JIRI:
C... could I have the d... definition?

SHAWN is watching MIKLOS.

FINEMAN: (over speakers)
Yes. Relating to the mastoid portion of the temporal bone and to the parietal bone.

JIRI looks in his father's direction. MIKLOS taps his dictionary.

JIRI:
M... A... S... T... O... P... A - R... I...

SHAWN notices JIRI'S tight grip on his inhaler. He also looks closer at MIKLOS and sees a wire running from his hand under his sleeve.

SHAWN:
(smiles) I got it.

GUS:
Let's call the Chief.

GUS and SHAWN get up and head to the back of the theatre as Mrs. FOOTE comes forward.

FOOTE:
And this year's winner of the central California regionals is Jiri Prochazka.

Mrs. FOOTE presents JIRI with the large cardboard check as those present applaud. GUS meets VICK, LASSITER and JULIET at the door. Onstage, SHAWN whoops and applauds.

SHAWN:
Whoop it up, people! This is what you came to see, right here! This is it! Yes! (holds up MIKLOS and JIRI'S arms in victory)

MIKLOS smiles nervously as he sees the police at the exits.

SHAWN:
This competition meant everything to Miklos! (SHAWN begins convulsing like he's being electrocuted.) Oh, boy! Gus! Gus, here we go! Gus, it's happening! (lets go of the hands and stumbles before recovering) I know who killed Elvin Cavanaugh.

VICK:
Can't he ever just tell us to arrest someone?

JULIET:
He does this a lot?

VICK and LASSITER:
Yes.

SHAWN:
(breathes heavily) I'm sorry. I'm kind of a slave to my visions. I'm a slave.

LASSITER:
(to VICK) Do you want me to cuff him?

VICK:
(looks at LASSITER) Why would I want that?

LASSITER:
Just a suggestion.

SHAWN:
They just sort of come when they want to come. Jiri... spell "soubrette".

MIKLOS:
Why is this man speaking?

SHAWN:
You can't, can you? Not without help from your dad. And that's not a real inhaler, is it?

MIKLOS:
This is crazy. This... this...

As SHAWN explains, we see in flashbacks what he's pieced together intercut with the reveal.

SHAWN:
(CAVANAUGH sees MIKLOS through the camera) Cheating was Cavanaugh's obsession. He was going to expose you as a cheater. (on stage) He was going to disqualify Jiri, and you knew it, and you couldn't let that happen. You had way too much to lose. (MIKLOS poisons the food) You slipped into the box. You knew his comfort was food. He was dangerously unhealthy. (on stage SHAWN reaches out)(CAVANAUGH eats) He's starting to go into shock...(the effects start)(on stage) You knew he wouldn't stop the bee. He never stops the bee. By the end of the round, it was too late. Too dizzy to walk, he stumbles...(CAVANAUGH tries to walk)(SHAWN stops at the edge of the stage) He tumbles over the rail, (CAVANAUGH falls) crashes to the chairs below...(MIKLOS remains in his seat as everyone rushes to CAVANAUGH) and there goes the evidence. (on stage) Except for one thing. (points) That inhaler.

JIRI slips the inhaler into his pocket.

SHAWN:
It sends electronic signals! The transmitter is in your jacket. You sent the signals from the audience to the stage. And I bet at your home, we'll find the van that ran me off the road when I alerted the police! Dangerous cocktail of unforgiving poisons.

JULIET:
You don't need it. (steps forward) I took your advice. I ran the Chinese food through the lab. Nothing's definite... (ro LASSITER) I'm sorry. He just seemed sure. I took a shot.

SHAWN:
(mouths) Thank you.

JULIET nods.

VICK:
I'll take it from here. (climbs the steps onto the stage)

MRS. FOOTE yanks the check out of JIRI'S hands.

EXT. CABRILLO THEATRE, DAY

JULIET escorts JIRI to the police car while LASSITER takes MIKLOS. SHAWN and GUS watch from the side of the road.

GUS:
I could've won that thing.

SHAWN:
Yeah, you could've. Thank the Lord you didn't.

GUS:
What is that supposed to mean?

The police car drives away and SHAWN and GUS walk along the side of the road.

SHAWN:
Oh, Gus. The guy who wins? Saddled forever as, you know, the dude that won the spelling bee. I'm sure you would have dealt with it later, but kids, high school kids especially, they're just ruthless... judgmental... horrible little bastards. (counts on his fingers) You wouldn't have been able to date a cheerleader. They wouldn't have invited you to any parties. You'd have been the object of ridicule. I mean, this way, you got to be a smart kid and a cool kid, the best of both worlds.

GUS:
That's true. I appreciate that, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Yeah, it was a nice balance. That's why I had to give you the wrong letter.

GUS:
(stops and glares at SHAWN) You knew that was wrong?

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, Gus. "Aggiornamento"? Everybody knew it was an "I".

GUS starts to get angry.

SHAWN:
(backs away) All right, you hold on. You were happy one second ago.

GUS:
I was about to win! I studied for three months!

SHAWN:
Yeah, and you would have kept studying forever and ever, all the way till nationals!

GUS starts walking towards him slowly.

SHAWN:
You're upset now, I can see that, but you'll be fine with it later.

GUS:
You know what that did to me?

SHAWN:
Yes, yes, I do. We went out the next night, and... and you were so flustered that you threw caution to the wind (starts moving more quickly as GUS gets closer) and you hooked up with Melinda Castleberg! It was nice! (limp/runs away)

GUS:
(chases) Come here, Shawn!

SHAWN:
At least I was honest!

GUS:
Come here!

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, DAY

HENRY is reading inside when SHAWN knocks on the door. HENRY comes over and opens the door.

HENRY:
Ah, Shawn. What a coincidence. (has newspaper in hand) Yeah, I was just reading the newspaper, a little article that sounded very familiar about a spelling bee.

SHAWN:
Thanks for the help, Dad.

HENRY:
(removes glasses) Police ever get that evidence?

SHAWN:
Yeah, a funny little bird tipped them off.

HENRY:
(slips glasses in shirt pocket) Leg doing better?

SHAWN:
It's getting there, doesn't hurt so bad. (sighs) Listen, Dad, the thing about the house, the dog, it was kind of a big deal. And I know I held a grudge about it for a while. But I think you were right. A dog needs a house, and a doghouse needs an occupant, so (puts hands over heart) as a token of my appreciation, I left you a little something. Sincerely, thanks.

SHAWN turns away and smiles as he runs down the steps.

HENRY:
Shawn? Shawn? No! No way!

Tied to a post in front of the doghouse is a Golden Labrador puppy.

SHAWN:
Enjoy, Dad.

HENRY:
Shawn, you got to take this thing with you!

SHAWN locks the fence gate.

SHAWN:
Are you kidding? There's no pets allowed in my apartment. (runs across the road to GUS)

HENRY:
I'm going to stick it on the street, Shawn! I swear, I'm going to...Shawn!

EXT. BEACH, DAY

SHAWN runs over to GUS, snickering.

HENRY:
Shawn!

GUS:
He's not going to keep that thing, you know.

SHAWN:
It's my neighbor's dog.

HENRY:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
We'll take a lap around the block. Let him stew a little bit.

HENRY:
I'm gonna take it and I'm gonna go,

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, DAY

HENRY is holding the puppy.

HENRY:
I'm going to stick it on the street! Shawn! Shawn!

1985

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, MUD ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is searching cabinets and closets.

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN walks into the kitchen, his flip-flops slapping on the floor, and keeps searching. HENRY is sitting at the table reading the paper and drinking coffee.

HENRY:
Hey, Shawn, what in the world do you think you're doing?

SHAWN:
Hide and seek.

HENRY:
I don't think so.

SHAWN:
But you said we could.

HENRY:
Not like that.

SHAWN:
But that's how you play.

HENRY:
Not in my house. Shawn, you can't tail a suspect like that. Look how loud you are. (sets down paper and coffee) Your perp is going to hear you coming from every turn. Those things (points at flip-flops) smack every time you take a step. If you're going to wear them when you compete...

SHAWN:
Compete?

HENRY:
(whispers) On the balls of your feet. (stands and demonstrates) Balls of your feet. You take deliberate steps. You don't know where he is. He shouldn't get to know where you are. He's invisible, you're invisible. Now you've leveled the playing field.

SHAWN:
Can I go now?

HENRY:
No, you're going to learn to do the little things right. For instance... (kneels behind wall) when you peer around a corner, I want you to stay down low, because they're expecting you up here at eye level. (crawls on all fours) When you walk down a hall, check the grains of the carpet. We just vacuumed, right? And never, ever again do I ever want to hear you slam a door when you can pull it closed.

SHAWN:
But we're just playing.

HENRY:
Well, play right, Shawn, or don't play at all. (sits back in chair)

SHAWN takes off his flip-flops and walks across the floor on the balls of his feet.

HENRY:
Shawn, (whispers) he's not in here.

SHAWN crouches as heads for the door.

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN creeps down the hall and hides behind a section of wall where he listens to LASSITER talking with JULIET and other officers.

LASSITER:
I don't need to tell you how vital it is that we maintain the utmost secrecy on this heist. The Attorney General does not want his son's wedding disrupted any more than it's already been.

SHAWN leans nonchalantly in the corner as an officer walks past.

JULIET:
How will we explain our presence to the press?

LASSITER:
We don't. Just let 'em stew.

JULIET:
Well, that's one approach. But if I may suggest, I once wrote a paper regarding press releases and such, and...

SHAWN smiles at JULIET standing up to LASSITER as the detective glares at her.

JULIET:
Sorry, your idea sounds great.

LASSITER turns as a door opens and SHAWN ducks back.

LASSITER:
Get the board.

The detectives walk away from SHAWN and he leans out. On the other side, almost mirroring his movements, is GUS.

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
I'm on to something big.

GUS:
Tailing cops? In a police station?

SHAWN:
Some monumentally expensive ring just got stolen. I'm going to get us on the case.

GUS:
We just got a case five minutes ago. (has file in hand)

SHAWN:
Yeah, a lame one. Stolen computers from a high school? Come on, like you weren't falling asleep during that meeting.

An officer comes through the hall pulling a board with all the information from the case. He pauses to talk to another officer and SHAWN gets a chance to look at it.

SHAWN:
This is an heirloom. It's worth five million dollars. Lifted from the hotel where they're having the wedding. The wedding's on Saturday. Ooh. Open bar. We're so there.

GUS:
Are we looking at the same thing?

VICK finds them.

VICK:
I told you to wait in my office.

SHAWN:
I had a premonition. Something sparkly. Just over five carats, perfect clarity, slight inclusion. Is this ringing any bells for you?

VICK:
(takes file from GUS and gives it to SHAWN) Solve the case I gave you, then we'll talk. In the meantime, I have a lot of work to complete. (heads for office)

SHAWN:
(reads file) It's the secretary.

VICK:
(stops and turns back) Pardon?

SHAWN:
The secretary. The secretary did it. Now, what can you tell me about the ring I'm envisioning?

VICK:
(takes folder) You barely even looked at this folder.

SHAWN:
It's in the papers.

VICK:
Where?

SHAWN:
The signatures. It's in her handwriting. She's faking her own signature, and later, there's evidence that it's...

GUS nudges SHAWN in the elbow and SHAWN pretends to have a vision, his hand writing in the air.

SHAWN:
I feel it...in the ink. Very bad vibes. Strong... squidish vibes.

VICK:
We'll check it out. Until then, I trust you can find the door. (heads for office)

SHAWN:
What about the ring?

VICK:
Not until this one is done. (enters office)

GUS heads for the door. SHAWN, with a look at VICK'S office, starts after him.

SHAWN:
Hey, let me gather some information? Make a little headway. Then I'll have a psychic episode that blows the ears right off their skulls.

GUS:
Shawn, I'm in meetings all day. I barely had time to come down here for this. We're doing what the chief says. Period. (slaps SHAWN on the back and leaves)

Left to his own devices, SHAWN sneaks downstairs.

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

SHAWN peeks through the window before entering. Inside is a table with four chairs, the board from earlier as well as two women and a man. SHAWN checks the window to make sure no one followed him before turning to those inside.

SHAWN:
So sorry to have kept you waiting. I'm Shawn Spencer, Chief Psychic here at the department. (shakes WOMAN 1'S hand)

WOMAN 1:
Thank you so much for helping. This whole thing has been devastating.

SHAWN shakes the MAN'S hand.

MAN:
My hands are still shaking.

WOMAN 1:
You're doing fine.

SHAWN:
Okay, I only have a second. I'll need you to tell me everything I have to know about the case as quickly as humanly possible. (points to photo on the board) What about this guy? (draws a circle in the air over it) What's going on with the best man?

MAN:
I don't know. He's not answering his phone or his door. This day has just been completely unreal...

SHAWN:
Guys, it's going to be fine. You're in good hands. I've never failed in a case.

WOMAN 2:
(removes glasses) I know who you are. I read about you in the paper.

SHAWN:
(sees the papers WOMAN 2 is reading) You did? (walks over to her) You're the sister of the groom. (studies papers and photos as he shakes her hand) And the maid of honor. And the wedding planner?

WOMAN 2:
Correct.

SHAWN:
That is so many hats.

WOMAN 2:
You should see my closet.

SHAWN:
I'm hoping to... but not until I find this ring.

WOMAN 2:
Well, the wedding's tomorrow. How fast are you?

SHAWN:
That depends entirely on how much cooperation I receive.

WOMAN 1:
Why don't you come to the wedding.

SHAWN:
Yeah! No, no, I couldn't possibly impose on you. No.

WOMAN 1:
Please, you're saving us here. You find this ring, we'd owe you everything.

JULIET and LASSITER enter the room.

LASSITER:
What in the hell is going on here?

SHAWN:
I just dropped by to say hello. Guys, this is head detective Carlton Lassiter and his lovely new partner, Juliet. His last one turned out to be his girlfriend, so she was transferred. I'm not sure if that was the only reason. I'll let you decide for yourselves.

LASSITER puts his arm around SHAWN with a fake smile.

LASSITER:
Shall we?

SHAWN:
Sure.

LASSITER takes SHAWN out of the room.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER still has his arm around SHAWN'S shoulder.

SHAWN:
If this is some sort of hazing ritual where we're going to end up naked in a river somewhere, (LASSITER is now gripping SHAWN'S shirt collar) I'll need to arrange for a ride home.

LASSITER pushes SHAWN against the column at the base of the stairs.

LASSITER:
Listen to me, Spencer. The department's reputation is on the line with this one. If I catch you anywhere near this case, I will throw every book I can find at you.

SHAWN:
What if you find the Bible? You going to throw that, too? Seems a little sacrilegious, don't you think?

LASSITER forms a fist with his right hand, clenching it tightly as he walks away. The moment SHAWN hears the door close, he puts a hand to his shoulder and makes a pained face.

SHAWN:
Ow!

EXT. CENTRAL COAST PHARMACEUTICALS, DAY

GUS is in his car as his cell phone rings.

GUS: (into phone)
Burton Guster. Central Coast Pharmaceuticals.

SHAWN: (over phone)
Dude, I got a suspect.

GUS: (into phone)
I'll call you back later, Shawn.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN is on a corded landline phone.

SHAWN:
No, you can't. I left my cell phone in your car yesterday... along with a tuna sandwich.

EXT. CENTRAL COAST PHARMACEUTICALS, DAY

GUS sniffs.

SHAWN: (over phone)
I seriously hope you found that.

GUS: (into phone)
Later this afternoon, Shawn.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN:
No, Gus, this happens now. The wedding's tomorrow.

EXT. CENTRAL COAST PHARMACEUTICALS, DAY

GUS ends the call.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

A hand with a tattoo on the palm reaches out for the phone as SHAWN sighs. SHAWN hands it back and we see that hand belongs to a prisoner and SHAWN was using the phone from inside the cell.

PRISONER:
Is he coming?

SHAWN:
Not yet. But we're getting closer. Thanks, Stabber. (leaves)

INT. HOTEL, LOBBY, DAY

SHAWN arrives at the hotel and hides behind a planter as LASSITER, JULIET and two other police stride through.

LASSITER:
Mandatory briefing, Magnolia Room, 15 minutes. Excuse us, please. Attorney General Maxwell.

MAXWELL:
Detective. I trust we're making progress.

The two men shake hands.

LASSITER:
I am right on schedule, sir. I've booked myself a suite to use as a command center.

SHAWN peers through the leaves of the plants to watch the exchange.

MAXWELL:
Why?

LASSITER:
I'll stay the night if I have to, keep an eye on things...

MAXWELL:
The city's not paying for that, is it?

LASSITER:
Uh, no?

MAXWELL:
That ring has been in my family for 200 years. My mother agonized over the decision to give it to my son. I'm not letting it get away now.

LASSITER:
Sir, we are checking every person who came through that door.  Every employee. Every guest.

MAXWELL:
Nobody checks out of this hotel until we're just short of going through every piece of their luggage.

LASSITER:
Way ahead of you, sir.

MAXWELL:
No, you're not. (walks away)

LASSITER:
(looks at JULIET) What?

LASSITER looks towards the planter and SHAWN ducks down quickly. LASSITER and JULIET leave. A hotel security GUARD is leaning over behind SHAWN.

GUARD:
Can I help you, sir?

SHAWN:
(thinks) I'm just... listening. (puts ear against planter)

GUARD:
For what?

SHAWN:
For what? (turns his head and sees the GUARD'S protective mask and gloves) Lyme disease.

GUARD:
Lyme disease?

SHAWN:
Lyme disease. Rickets. Avitaminosis. Legionnaire's. Bubonic. You name it. I want you to listen to something. (knocks on base) Do you hear that?

GUARD:
Mmm-hmm.

SHAWN:
We have spores in the wall.

GUARD:
Spores?

SHAWN:
Know where else they are? In the planter. You know where else? (stands) Everywhere in the entire hotel.

GUARD:
Who called you? Mike?

SHAWN:
Mike? Is this a big joke to you? I don't answer to Mike. Have you seen Mike lately? Mike can kiss my ass. I was called in by the state inspector himself. Are you at all aware how dangerous this is?

GUARD:
Hell yes, I am! (puts hand on mask)

SHAWN:
Good. I'm glad. I need access to this whole place...elevator shafts, air vents, the safe room, obviously...

GUARD:
The safe room is a crime scene.

SHAWN:
This eucalyptus will be dead by lunch. The safe room will be a triage unit if I don't get those spores out of there.

GUARD:
(briefly holds mask over nose and mouth) Understood. Can we let the cops finish up in there first?

SHAWN:
You tell them to hurry.

GUARD:
Oh, man. (leaves with mask in place)

After the GUARD leaves, SHAWN heads in the opposite direction.

INT. HOTEL, MAGNOLIA ROOM, DAY

LASSITER is giving his briefing. The TV is showing the surveillance footage of the safe room the night the ring was taken.

LASSITER:
13 minutes after midnight, members of the wedding party entered the safe room, placing the ring into a safety deposit box, which was slid into the safe and closed for the night. No sensors indicate that either the safe door or the lock box was opened again until the following morning. Please note, he has activated the time-lock, which prevents the safe from opening. No one walks into that room again until the following morning, when the ring is discovered missing.

McNAB:
(raises his hand) So it definitely didn't disappear during the night.

LASSITER:
Or so they would like you to think. However, if you look closely, there are nine glitches on this tape.

JULIET:
I'm sorry, glitches?

LASSITER:
Seams, static bursts in the image. Someone could have tapped in an alternate video feed of this room while it was empty. Or, more likely, as I believe, someone built a scale replica of this room.

A man laughs.

LASSITER:
Who laughed? Nobody?

As LASSITER turns to face the board, the man laughs again.

LASSITER:
(turns back) If someone disagrees with my theory, I'd like to know.

JULIET:
It does seem very elaborate.

McNAB:
And just a bit far-fetched.

LASSITER:
Are you a detective? Why are you here?

As LASSITER speaks, the camera pans up to the air vent.

McNAB:
You asked for all of us to come.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL, AIR DUCT, DAY

We can see LASSITER through the vent.

LASSITER:
Oh, well, Officer, since you're such an expert on fetching,

SHAWN is lying on his stomach listening in on the briefing.

LASSITER:
why don't you fetch me a cup of coffee.

SHAWN laughs again and LASSITER looks up to the vent. McNAB gets up and leaves to get the coffee.

LASSITER:
Moving on. All the employee alibis check out, except this one. (points to photo) Dietrich Mannheim. Currently the facilities manager. You may remember him from the security video. He was in the room when the ring was placed into the safety deposit box.

SHAWN smiles and leans closer over the vent.

LASSITER:
During questioning, he was nervous, evasive, and contradicted himself more than once. His work computer history reveals that he recently visited websites for boats and expensive cars, and he failed to show up for work. Questions?

JULIET:
Is this your only lead?

LASSITER:
His responses to my interrogation were hostile at best.

JULIET:
Clarify "hostile".

LASSITER:
Use my tone now as a guide.

INT. HOTEL, RESTAURANT, DAY

JULIET is sitting at a table by a large window picking at her food when SHAWN enters. He dusts off his shoulders and slides into the chair across from her.

SHAWN:
Detective O'Hara, all alone.

JULIET:
Well, not anymore, apparently.

SHAWN:
Work troubles? (raises hand to head) Yeah, I'm sensing work troubles. Here, let me read your palm.

JULIET:
How about just one finger?

SHAWN:
Come, now, let me see if I can be helpful.

JULIET:
Why are you here?

SHAWN:
The Maxwell wedding. Honestly. I was invited.

JULIET:
By whom?

SHAWN:
Beth. Bethany. The bride. Little baby "B". The "B" sting. Love her. God, Dylan is so lucky to have her. She grounds him in ways that he needed grounding, don't you think?

JULIET shakes her head and holds out her left hand, palm up.

SHAWN:
She's a good sport.(takes hand in both of his) Air supply? Really? Kidding. Just kidding. Relax. (closes eyes) This is work related. You thought this place would be different, (opens eyes) but nobody respects your opinions. They all think you're too young.

JULIET:
Always.

SHAWN:
Always.

They both realize that SHAWN is holding JULIET'S hand and SHAWN let's go and leans back in the chair.

SHAWN:
You know, I think you and I could help each other.

JULIET:
And how would that be?

SHAWN:
Well, I know things. Things about rings.

JULIET:
Oh, I thought you were here for a wedding.

SHAWN:
I am... ish.

JULIET looks around the room before putter her elbows on the table and resting her chin on her interlocked fingers. SHAWN mimics her.

JULIET:
You first.

SHAWN smiles.

INT. CCP, GUS' OFFICE, DAY

A SECRETARY walks up to his office door. GUS is sitting at his desk.

SECRETARY:
I just got a message for you, Mr. Guster, and, um... well, I'm afraid it's about your cat.

GUS:
My cat?

SECRETARY:
The poor thing is in the animal hospital. They think her leg is broken.

GUS:
I'll...I'll get down there later.

SECRETARY:
You're not going?

Another SECRETARY walks down the hall and stands next to the first.

GUS:
I'm very busy.

SECRETARY:
But your cat needs you, for moral support. The vet said it could be the difference.

GUS:
Later.

SECRETARY 2:
You have to go.

SECRETARY:
Mr. Guster, I know that you're in shock. Don't do anything you're going to regret forever.

GUS:
I don't even...

SECRETARY 3:
He's not going?

Giving up the argument, GUS stands, picks up his jacket and leaves his office. The SECRETARY smiles.

EXT. CENTRAL COAST PHARMACEUTICALS, DAY

GUS exits the building to find SHAWN lying on the front of his company car.

GUS:
So now I have a cat.

SHAWN:
(sits up) An orange tabby. Last Christmas, you made her a tiny Santa hat. It was adorable.

GUS:
Fantastic. I can't even have a make-believe boy cat.

SHAWN:
Gus, a boy cat wouldn't serve my purposes nearly as well. The next time I need you, Pickles is having kittens.

GUS:
"Pickles"?

SHAWN:
"Mrs. Pickles" is her full name. Though I'm not actually sure cats can marry outside of Boston.

GUS:
Yeah, well, in a related issue, I'm blocking your number on all the phones in the office. (heads for the entrance)

SHAWN:
If you think that'll work, I think it's endearing. In the meantime, aren't you the least bit curious about who was there when they put the ring in the hotel safe?

GUS:
(stops and walks back) Wait a minute. This is a safecracking case?

SHAWN:
Did I forget to mention that? (gets off the car and opens the passenger door)

GUS:
What kind of safe?

SHAWN:
The, uh...Hydra 700? (gets in car)

GUS:
The 700 is out? (talks through the window) That's impossible. Nobody could have cracked that.

SHAWN:
(closes door) I haven't even told you about the wall sensors.

GUS:
(looks at the building) Can we be done by 3:00?

SHAWN:
(thinks) Yes.

GUS gets in the car.

INT. HOTEL, LOBBY, DAY

There is police tape along the Registration Desk as SHAWN and GUS enter the hotel. Uniformed officers are all around.

SHAWN:
The safe room, right behind that door.

GUS:
What is all this? I thought this was a safe job.

SHAWN:
Oh, uh, Lassiter has this insane idea that this is an elaborate heist, like on par with Ocean's Eleven, or Thomas Crown, or, uh... the one where they kill Donald Sutherland in the first 10 minutes. Remake. Uh...

VICK comes up behind them.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer. Mr. Guster. What a surprise.

SHAWN:
Chief! Lookin' good. You're probably wondering...

VICK:
I sent an officer down to the high school to take a look at your secretary suspect. She cracked. He didn't even get the first question out.

SHAWN:
(surprised) Really? (nudged by GUS) 'Cause I...envisioned that being harder.

VICK:
Yet I don't recall asking you to come down here to the de la Cruz.

GUS:
Well, we have reason to believe this case goes in a completely different direction.

VICK:
Huh. Let me be perfectly clear. I didn't see you and we didn't talk. Call me if you have something. (leaves)

SHAWN:
I love her.

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN and GUS cross the floor to Registration. The CLERK behind the counter waves at SHAWN who motions for him to stop.

GUS:
He knows you?

SHAWN:
I had to lay some groundwork. He doesn't believe in psychics. This is plan "B".

CLERK:
Chief inspector Shawn, how are you?

SHAWN:
(shushes) I'm undercover. Not even the American police know I'm in on this.

CLERK:
(stammers) I'm sorry. I... I blew it again. A... and after you brought me into your confidence...

SHAWN:
Bobby. It's fine. Believe me, these other Interpol guys are very appreciative of what you're doing here.

BOBBY:
(picks up binder bearing Union Flag on the back) How long will you need?

SHAWN:
Just as we discussed. Five minutes, tops. (shakes BOBBY'S hand) You're my man.

BOBBY leaves and SHAWN and GUS go behind the counter.

GUS:
Interpol?

SHAWN:
(uses a computer) That's right. Missing ring division. I was recruited out of North Africa when I was 15.

GUS:
You could have at least used a British accent.

SHAWN:
(British accent) Oh, please, Gus. I started with a British accent, and then seamlessly slipped...( regular voice) into my fake American one. Bobby gave me some pointers. Apparently you Americans say "howdy" a lot. (a pretty woman walks by) Howdy. (watches her)

GUS:
(slaps SHAWN) What are you doing?

SHAWN:
Uh, a list.  (pulls folded paper from pants pocket) I made a list of suspects after attending Lassiter's briefing.

GUS:
He let you in his briefing?

SHAWN:
(laughs) He does when you're in the air shaft.

GUS:
(reads list) All your suspects are in the wedding party.

SHAWN:
Look, the only ones who knew they put that ring in the safe were at the rehearsal dinner.

GUS:
So it was an inside job.

SHAWN:
Looking like it.

GUS:
(sees what SHAWN is doing) You're making keys?

SHAWN:
Gus, how else do you expect me to get in the rooms?

GUS:
Shawn, you can't do that.

SHAWN:
Of course I can, I worked at the Hampton Inn for that three-day weekend in Austin when we were 19. I know you remember that. Gus, this is so easy. Try making a key.

GUS only glares at him.

INT. HOTEL, HALL, DAY

SHAWN looks at the door numbers and stops at one of those he was looking for. He uses one of the keys he made. It works.

SHAWN:
Dude, I rule. (looks inside the room) Nope. Innocent. Let's move. (closes door)

GUS:
What are you talking about? We haven't even stepped foot in there.

SHAWN:
Gus, do you need the remedial course? Really?

SHAWN rolls his eyes and opens the door. He sees a set of keys, wallet and glasses on the nightstand.

SHAWN:
Uncle Leo left his wallet on the table. Criminals are sneaky, jaded, suspicious people. They're smart and defensive. This guy has a reason to be trusting. Can we go now?

GUS motions with his hand for SHAWN to continue. SHAWN opens the door across the hall.

INT. HOTEL, BRIDAL SUITE, DAY

Inside are DYLAN, BETHANY, LACEY and other members of the families.

BETHANY:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
Guys. Hey. Uh, your door was open.

DYLAN:
Oh, it was?

SHAWN:
Yes, and I was worried that something horrible had happened. You're...you're okay?

DYLAN:
(takes BETHANY'S hand) Yeah. Yeah.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) I told you we didn't have to come in here. They're fine. Everybody's fine. This is my associate, Gus. You can just call him "Peter Panic".

DYLAN reaches out to shake GUS' hand.

GUS:
How you doing?

GUS and SHAWN step down into the room.

DYLAN:
So you're a psychic, too?

GUS:
Well...

SHAWN:
Gus here is a safe expert. Yes, he subscribes to "The Safecracker", a safecracking...comic book.

SHAWN walks over to LACEY.

GUS:
It's an online magazine. And it's a trade publication.

SHAWN:
(sits by LACEY) Excuse me for saying so, but how exactly do you figure into this legal family?

LACEY:
I started my criminal law degree. Then I came to my senses, went to Europe, painted, slept, ate, sank a boat. (SHAWN gasps) Disappointed?

SHAWN:
Besotted.

GUS:
We'd like to speak to the best man, if possible.

DYLAN:
So would we. Any ideas where he is?

LACEY:
We haven't seen him since the night of the 6th.

SHAWN:
That's the night the ring disappeared.

BETHANY:
The florist quit. So after we dropped the ring off at the safe, we had to wrap bouquets all night in our suite. (sits next to SHAWN)

DYLAN:
Everybody except Jack.

GUS:
Do you think he's a suspect?

DYLAN:
No, we just think he's lazy.

MAXWELL enters from an adjoining room, wrapped present in his hand.

DYLAN:
Hey, Dad, this is Shawn Spencer. He's the psychic I told you about.

SHAWN stands.

MAXWELL:
I know. (shakes SHAWN'S hand) Let's talk. (yanks him by the arm before walking him towards the door, arm about SHAWN'S shoulder) Son, I'm very comfortable with the current direction of the investigation. So let's let the real police department do their job. (opens door)

SHAWN:
Sir, believe me, I am only here to help.

GUS rolls his eyes and walks out the door.

SHAWN:
In fact, I was actually hoping to discuss...

MAXWELL:
I'm glad you understand. (politely pushes SHAWN out the door)

INT. HOTEL, HALL, DAY

SHAWN shakes his hand in the air to restore circulation.

SHAWN:
The guy shook my hand like I stole something.

SHAWN inserts a key card in another door. GUS knocks on the door.

SHAWN:
See? That's why I can't do this job alone.

When no one answers, they go inside.

INT. HOTEL, LASSITER'S SUITE, DAY

The decor and linens are orange. The are two evidence videotapes resting by the TV.

SHAWN:
Wow. That is about as orange as you can get.

GUS:
(closes door) Which suspect's room is this?

SHAWN:
Lassiter's. (starts going through the welcome food basket and takes an apple)

GUS:
The head detective? He has his own room?

SHAWN:
Perhaps paid for by the city.

GUS:
No. No. This has gone too far. We're not staying.

SHAWN:
(opens file) Gus, we need these witness statements. It's not exactly like we're being overwhelmed with cooperation here.

SHAWN throws an apple across the room to GUS. Catching it, barely, GUS then peers through the peephole into the hall. In the file, SHAWN finds a photo of LACEY.

SHAWN:
Oh, Lacey. Lacey, you can sink my boat. (jumps onto the bed with the file, stretches out and takes a bite of apple) Toss me the remote? (GUS throws it at him) Whoa!

GUS begins going through the other files on the counter as SHAWN turns on the TV to a baseball game.

TV ANNOUNCER:
It's the bottom of the eighth inning, and so far...

SHAWN:
What do you got? You got anything good?

GUS:
I hate to say it, but yeah. The Attorney General has an insurance policy on the ring. He'll collect a cool $3 million as long as it still belongs to him, which it does only until these two are married.

SHAWN:
Well, well, well.

They hear someone at the door so they straighten the files and SHAWN ducks down on the far side of the bed and GUS hides behind the counter. We see a pair of feet and then see it is only a bellboy bringing fresh towels. He sees SHAWN.

BELLBOY:
(stammers) I... I'm supposed to knock. Forgive me, Detective.

SHAWN:
Detective?

BELLBOY:
(makes a face) Head Detective. Sorry.

SHAWN and GUS both get up.

BELLBOY:
I was told you wouldn't be here until 6:00 tonight.

SHAWN:
That's right. 6:00 tonight. Head detective. I changed my plan. Please don't tell anyone.

BELLBOY:
Absolutely, sir. (zips lip)

SHAWN:
Thanks. 6:00, huh?

BELLBOY:
Is there anything I can do for you while I'm here?

SHAWN:
As a matter of fact, yes, there is. We'd like a room service menu delivered immediately.

The BELLBOY smiles and salutes.

INT. HOTEL, LOBBY, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter from the west elevator. SHAWN is eating some pastry/bread.

GUS:
In Lassiter's photo, there didn't appear to be a mark on that safe. I don't care how good you are, you don't crack a Hydra without leaving some sort of visible residue. We need to see that safe.

SHAWN:
That's going to be a little difficult.

Officers are blocking the entrance to the safe room.

SHAWN:
How close do you need to be?

INT. HOTEL, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS sneak into the kitchen.

GUS:
Is there a secret back door through the kitchen?

SHAWN:
No, we're going to take the air vents. Unfortunately, both my access points are blocked by Santa Barbara's finest.

SHAWN stops at the dumbwaiter.

GUS:
You think I'm going in there?

SHAWN:
You know you want to.

GUS:
Not in this suit.

SHAWN:
Do you want to see the safe or not? Look, this'll be easy. We take this dumbwaiter up to the grate, pop the screen, crawl right through the shafts. Three rights and a left. We check our progress through the vents.

SHAWN opens the dumbwaiter and gasps when he sees the body inside. GUS puts a hand to his mouth and whimpers. SHAWN then notices the blood dripping from the body's ear and the nametag: Dietrich Mannheim. He also sees the tips of his shoes and the scuff marks on the wall.

SHAWN:
Isn't it kind of weird how the body's just shoved in here?

GUS:
No, what's weird is there's a dead guy in a dumbwaiter and we're standing here staring at it, waiting for somebody to find us. Let's go!

SHAWN:
This is Lassiter's suspect.

GUS:
Shawn, close the hatch and keep your voice down. I don't want to explain how we got in here.

SHAWN:
I just need to see one thing.

SHAWN'S cellphone rings and the two of them fumble through SHAWN'S pockets to answer it quickly. GUS gets it and then SHAWN grabs it from him.

SHAWN:
You answered it. Uh, hello?

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

HENRY is sitting at his desk and there is a box of trophies and stuff on the table behind him.

HENRY:
Three days, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Dad, hey! Going to have to call you back.

HENRY:
No, no, (stands and walks across room) you were supposed to call me yesterday, you were supposed to call me the day before. We need to handle this now.

SHAWN:
Dad, I'm a little busy right now.

HENRY:
Shawn, just tell me when you're going to come by and pick up the box of trophies.

SHAWN:
Really tough to be sure.

HENRY:
Last week, you were all gung-ho about getting this stuff back. I went upstairs, I brought it down for you, it's sitting in the middle of my kitchen table. I need my kitchen table, Shawn.

SHAWN:
You're right. Can I please call you back, Dad?

HENRY:
How about you just give me an answer?

SHAWN:
Tonight. Uh, no. Tomorrow.

HENRY:
Tomorrow. Wonderful. Otherwise, I am putting it outside, and that's where it's sitting. (sits) Now, how hard was that?

SHAWN:
So easy. Anything else?

HENRY:
No, unless, of course, you need something.

SHAWN:
Nope, I'm good. Actually, wait, I do have one question.

HENRY:
Go ahead.

SHAWN:
How long does it take before a dead body starts to smell bad?

HENRY:
(laughs) God...(hangs up)

INT. HOTEL, BAR, DAY

SHAWN and GUS leave through the bar.

GUS:
Did you wipe our fingerprints off?

SHAWN:
Of course I did. We were never there.

GUS:
We need to call the Chief soon. If Dietrich was a part of this, he's not anymore.

LASSITER and O'HARA enter while SHAWN and GUS are leaving.

LASSITER:
Why is it the Attorney General has to call me wondering why some civilian is wandering around, grilling his entire family?

SHAWN:
Wait a second. The Attorney General has your number? What, are you guys tight? Give it up. What's the story?

LASSITER:
He also told me to keep you out of here by any means necessary,(grips SHAWN'S shoulders) which opens up an entire world of exciting possibilities for me personally. (pushes SHAWN forward)

SHAWN groans and jerks his body around back towards the kitchen as he has a "vision".

SHAWN:
Gus! Gus!

LASSITER, JULIET and GUS follow.

INT. HOTEL, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN burst through the door, still in the throes of his "vision".

SHAWN:
Oh, it's too much! It's too much! Too much!

LASSITER reaches for his gun.

JULIET:
You're not going to shoot him, are you?

LASSITER:
I haven't decided.

SHAWN:
Oh, my ear! (has left hand over left ear) Gus, my ear!

LASSITER:
Oh, for the love of Mike! You are not going to escape, so will you just give it up?

LASSITER grabs SHAWN - or tries to - and pushes him against the work counter. SHAWN keeps twisting, grabbing at utensils and pots as they progress.

LASSITER:
Give it up!

SHAWN presses a towel over LASSITER'S face.

SHAWN:
Check the dumbwaiter! Open the dumbwaiter! Detective O'Hara!

LASSITER tries to lift SHAWN, at least one leg. JULIET opens the dumbwaiter and the body falls out.

JULIET:
Oh, my God! (tries to push the body back)Lassiter. Lassiter.

GUS looks away. LASSITER releases SHAWN and looks at the dumbwaiter dumbfounded.

JULIET:
Lassiter...Get over here!

LATER>>>>>

SOCO is taking photos of the dumbwaiter and the Coroner's Office is there to take the body.

LASSITER:
Let's go. Get him in the van. Come on. You two, out. (grabs SHAWN by the back of the jacket and forces him along)

SHAWN:
Don't we get to wait around for the autopsy?

LASSITER:
We'll call you if we need you.

MAXWELL enters the kitchen.

MAXWELL:
Detective.

LASSITER:
Sir.

MAXWELL and LASSITER walk towards the dumbwaiter.

MAXWELL:
Shut this down. Keep it quiet. Nobody in the wedding party is to know about this. They've been through enough.

LASSITER:
Yes, sir.

MAXWELL looks into the dumbwaiter.

MAXWELL:
So, this is it.

SHAWN:
Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while.

INT. HOTEL, LASSITER'S SUITE, DAY

SHAWN sits back on the bed having turned on the TV.

GUS:
Can we at least watch the tape in another room besides Lassiter's?

SHAWN has kicked his shoes off and has the basket of food resting next to him.

SHAWN:
Gus, he's not coming back.

GUS:
Are you sure about that?

SHAWN:
Yes. Didn't you check his messages? Are you going to have some cookies?

GUS:
(crosses arms) No.

SHAWN:
You want to finish my banana?

GUS:
I want to leave.

The footage from the safe room plays on the TV.

SHAWN:
Look at the best man. He's smashed. And look at his hair. It's horrible.

GUS:
That's it?

SHAWN:
Hmm. We have to watch it again.

There's a knock on the door.

SHAWN:
It's open!

GUS:
"It's open"? What are you doing?

DYLAN enters with a six-pack of beer.

DYLAN:
Oh, what, am I early?

SHAWN:
Big Dyl! You're right on time. (to GUS) Did I forget to mention that we're hosting the bachelor party?

GUS shoots daggers at SHAWN before walking over to the bar and leaning on it. DYLAN offers him a beer.

GUS:
No, thank you.

LATER>>>>

The bachelor party is underway. SHAWN is in the middle of telling a joke/story.

SHAWN:
Dude says, "Uh-oh. I thought you said you wanted it inside the pinata!"

They all laugh.

SHAWN:
Eat! Eat like men! (runs over to where GUS is standing against the wall) You're really mad?

GUS:
We have less than 12 hours to solve the case, and you're throwing a kegger in a police officer's room. Why would I be mad?

SHAWN:
Gus, his best man was a total washout. He wasn't going to plan anything.

GUS:
We have to dig information out of suspects, and you're wasting time.

SHAWN:
Dylan!

DYLAN:
Dude! You, wow! Yes, (mimics visions with sound) wow!

SHAWN:
Gus here has some questions for you, you flaxen-haired Argonaut.

DYLAN:
Anything for you two. I love you guys.

SHAWN:
I've found that they're particularly forthcoming with information while in this state. For example, I've eliminated every suspect here. Although there is a guy stealing cable and another refilling his minibar bottles with shampoo, but I don't think these are gateway crimes to a jewelry heist.

A drunk DYLAN comes over to them.

DYLAN:
Seriously. Gus, come on, give me a kiss.

GUS and SHAWN look at each other.

DYLAN:
No, no, nothing weird. On my cheek.

GUS:
(jabs SHAWN with his elbow) Get me out of here.

SHAWN:
I think it's your turn to dig.

GUS:
Do you know who stole the ring?

DYLAN:
No. And to be honest, I don't care. I didn't even want the damn thing. Okay, the night that we announced our engagement, no, my dad stops dinner, right in the middle of my speech. (sits) So, he goes and gets my grandmother's ring. What am I supposed to say? "No"? So now it's not about us. It's about him again. I mean, forget the fact that I just chose the person that I want to spend the rest of my life with. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but if it were up to me, I'd just as soon we stop looking.

GUS:
Cross him off.

SHAWN:
Dylan, how is Dad? I mean, financially, would you say everything is...

DYLAN passes out.

SHAWN:
Okay.

GUS:
So much for that.

SHAWN:
Dylan was the only shot we had in this room, but that's okay. We have other suspects in this hotel.

SHAWN picks up a beer from the bar.

SHAWN:
At least take a traveler.

GUS takes it from him and puts it back. They leave the room.

INT. HOTEL, BRIDAL SUITE, NIGHT

The women are having the bachelorette party. SHAWN and GUS have infiltrated and are drinking shots with them. SHAWN has a flowered boa wrapped around his neck.

SHAWN:
Ah! Sweet nectar!

GUS:
Yeah! All right!

SHAWN:
It's crazy running into you guys here. What are the odds?

SHAWN and GUS flop back on the couch.

SHAWN:
You got anything?

GUS:
These girls are not criminals.

SHAWN:
Well, it was worth a shot.

LACEY sits next to SHAWN.

LACEY:
You want to get out of here?

SHAWN:
Yes, I do.

LACEY takes him by the hand and they get up. SHAWN removes the boa.

INT. HOTEL, LOBBY, NIGHT

SHAWN and LACEY exit the elevator hand-in-hand.

SHAWN:
So how you holding up?

LACEY:
I'm good. My dad brought in all this extra security for some reason.

SHAWN:
Can he afford that?

LACEY:
What do you mean?

SHAWN:
I don't know. It's just... It was a tough year financially for a lot of people...

LACEY:
What are you getting at?

SHAWN:
I'm just making random conversation.

LACEY gasps as they reach the refrigerator that houses the bouquets.

LACEY:
Here's my bouquet.

SHAWN:
Oh, it's fantastic.

LACEY:
Well, it's subpar. I was rushed. All that craziness. I wish I could fix it.

SHAWN:
Well, let's just...let's just take it out. (goes to open door)

LACEY:
It's locked.

SHAWN:
They lock up flowers?

LACEY:
I bet you could open it. You have good hands.

The elevator bell dings and SHAWN looks over his shoulder to see GUS walk out, his shirt unbuttoned showing a patch of shaving cream on his chest. There is also cream along his head like a laurel wreath.

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Excuse me.

GUS:
You left me in there.

SHAWN:
(walks over to GUS) Yes, I did, and you're very welcome.

GUS:
I just got a lap dance from Patrick Swayze.

SHAWN:
What do you mean? Like an impersonator?

GUS:
No, I think it was actually Patrick Swayze. I'm going home. We're done. All we've done is eliminate suspects. We're back where we started.

SHAWN:
Oh, Gus, we're fine. We've got the wedding ceremony tomorrow to solve the case.

GUS:
Oh, oh, okay. So we can do what an entire police force can't in two hours?

SHAWN:
Hmm. Okay, you're right. We should totally get there half an hour early.

GUS just points at him at walks away back to the elevator.

INT. HOTEL, BRIDAL SUITE, DAY

SHAWN enters wearing a nice suit with a white shirt and grey tie. He is carrying a present. BETHANY is in her gown and the bridesmaids are wearing mint green dresses with spaghetti straps. LACEY is pacing.

SHAWN:
Ah, you are the most beautiful bride in this room. (gives BETHANY the present)

BETHANY:
Thank you. (sets down present)

SHAWN:
Does anyone need help?

LACEY:
The bouquets still aren't here. We might as well not even have the ceremony.

SHAWN:
(walks to LACEY) Okay, you, relax. Breathe. (rubs his hands along her arms) Think happy thoughts. Puffy clouds, mac and cheese, Lou Diamond Phillips...(the bouquets arrive) Look, it worked.

LACEY pushes SHAWN aside and rushes to the wheeled table where a maid starts taking the bouquets out of the water.

LACEY:
What are you doing?

MAID:
Helping.

LACEY:
No, those bouquets are very specific.(takes bouquets from MAID)

MAID:
They look identical, ma'am.

BETHANY:
(to SHAWN) It's my wedding. Shouldn't I be the one freaking out?

SHAWN:
Plenty of time for that later.

LACEY:
(searches flowers) Where is it? Where's my bouquet?

BETHANY:
She's really a very nice person under normal circumstances.

SHAWN:
(walks over to LACEY) Lace? Everything okay up here? You all right?

LACEY:
(finds bouquet) Yeah. Sorry. I think I'm having sympathy Bridezilla. I'm good now.

SHAWN:
Great

The Flower Girl sits by BETHANY on the couch.

BETHANY:
EMMA doesn't want to wear the flower in her hair.

LACEY goes over and squats down in front of EMMA.

LACEY:
But these are magic flowers.

LACEY reaches behind EMMA'S ear and retrieves a flower. EMMA gasps in surprise. SHAWN seems impressed.

LACEY:
Do you want one now?

EMMA nods excitedly.

INT. HOTEL, LOBBY, DAY

LASSITER is looking at pages of receipts for his suite.

BOBBY:
I don't know what to tell you, sir, but these are the charges.

LASSITER:
$1600 for a junior suite? With a queen bed?

BOBBY:
Well, the room was a small portion. However, it's all your room charges that drove up your bill.

LASSITER:
I was hardly even in the room.

BOBBY:
I'm sorry, Detective Lassiter, but that's what it says here.

BELLBOY:
This isn't Detective Lassiter.

LASSITER:
I beg your pardon?

BELLBOY:
Oh, he's a shorter guy. Brown hair. Suede jacket. Helped him fill the Jacuzzi with champagne last night.

LASSITER:
(through clenched teeth) Really? If I brought this man here, could you identify him?

BELLBOY:
Oh, absolutely. In fact, I can tell you where he is. He's over at the Maxwell wedding. The chapel is just outside the east lawn.

LASSITER:
I'll be right back.

INT. CHAPEL, DAY

The couple is saying their vows.

MINISTER:
"I, Dylan, take you, Bethany... "

DYLAN:
I, Dylan, take you, Bethany...

MINISTER:
"to be my wife... "

DYLAN:
to be my wife...

LASSITER and JULIET enter.

MINISTER:
"that you will be a faithful friend... "

DYLAN:
that you will be a faithful friend...

GUS comes in behind the detectives.

MINISTER:
"and a true and loving companion. "

DYLAN:
and a true and loving companion.

MINISTER:
"I give to you my sacred vow..."

DYLAN:
I give to you my sacred vow...

GUS:
(cuts between them) Excuse me.

LASSITER starts after him, but JULIET takes his arm.

JULIET:
I think we should wait until the ceremony's over.

LASSITER:
Fine. (crosses arms)

GUS takes a seat next to SHAWN.

GUS:
Nice suit. Where'd you get that from?

SHAWN:
Gus, don't underestimate me, or my wardrobe.

GUS:
(sees tag hidden under lapel) Then you might want to remove...

SHAWN:
Don't pull that off. Don't, don't, don't. I'll just slide it... (tucks it back in place)

GUS turns back to the detectives and LASSITER holds up a key card between his fingers. GUS turns back.

GUS:
They're here for you.

SHAWN:
Not if I solve this case first.

GUS:
Good plan. You've got about five minutes.

SHAWN:
I already know who did it.

GUS:
No, you don't. How is that possible? Between all that, when you said your girlfriend just had an aneurysm because she got the wrong bouquet, you had the time to put all that out of your mind and solve the case?

SHAWN:
Gus...

GUS:
what?

MINISTER:
And now for a moment of silence.

Everyone in the chapel bows their head.

SHAWN:
Gus, I seriously do have a guess.

GUS:
Probability of being right?

SHAWN:
I don't know, high 60s?

GUS:
Close your mouth.

SHAWN:
But the person's in the room.

A woman sitting two pews in front of them shushes them.

SHAWN:
The thief could escape. Shouldn't I stop the wedding?

GUS:
No, under no circumstances are you allowed to stop this wedding.

MINISTER:
If there's any reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.

After an internal debate, SHAWN stands.

SHAWN:
I have something. It's not necessarily marriage-related. I hope that's not a problem.

MINISTER:
Sir, please...

SHAWN:
I know who stole the ring.

LACEY:
You cannot do this, Shawn. This wedding has taken over a year to plan.

JULIET pulls out her radio.

LASSITER:
What are you doing?

JULIET:
Radioing the chief.

SHAWN:
(puts a hand to his head, eyes closed) I can see it. I can feel it. I can now feel the ring. (opens eyes) It's in this room. It's in the room. It's in this room.

GUS:
(pulls SHAWN down) They wouldn't bring the stolen ring to the ceremony, you moron.

SHAWN:
They would if they couldn't get to it till today. (stands) Lacey, I'm so sorry. And believe me when I say, I really, really, really wish it wasn't you.

LACEY:
Me? Are you crazy? I'm the one who's done all the work.

SHAWN:
Yes, you are, and we're all very impressed, but it was also an excellent cover, wasn't it?

LACEY:
You are crazy, Shawn. And by the way, we're officially off for next Friday.

SHAWN falls to his knees as the "vision" hits him. We "see" everything as he explains it.

SHAWN:
Oh, boy! I can see it now! You're at the dinner table. They're announcing the engagement. You're thrilled, of course. You and Bethany have been best friends forever. Dad... Dad has a surprise for the happy couple. What could it be? Wait a minute. You didn't know the ring was going to Dylan. (stands)  You were always your grandmother's favorite, and you're the oldest girl. That ring should be yours, right? Right. You were counting on that ring. It was your future. (goes on his knees, his hands resting on a guest)  Sorry. I can see you plotting. I can see you plotting right there at the dinner table, but Dad... Dad throws a curveball.(stands) No, it was a slider. He's overly cautious, because sometimes engagements end. Not you guys. It's okay. They're not letting go of the ring until the wedding, which means you have a very small window within which to grab it.

BETHANY looks at LACEY, asking for the truth.

MINISTER:
Does all of this have anything to do with why these two shouldn't be married?

SHAWN:
No, sir. No, it doesn't at all, actually. (clears throat) Oh, boy! Oh, boy. Oh, boy. (waggles ring finger on left hand) Of course, you insisted it be used during the rehearsal, so then you had your chance.

VICK arrives.

SHAWN:
While everyone else was fawning over the ring, you made one final adjustment. It looked like you just straightened it out and put it right back, but you never did, did you? No, Lacey, because you... have magic hands... which I was really looking forward to on Friday. Everyone was fooled. Everyone was fooled except... Dietrich Mannheim, who hadn't yet discovered how to use this information to his benefit.

LACEY:
This is first-rate fiction, Shawn. Unfortunately, there's no evidence.

SHAWN:
There would have been no evidence if you could have gotten away that night. But there was a problem. (groans and staggers to a flower vase on a pedestal) Yes! You were called away. (sniffs the flowers and hugs the bouquet) The florist. The florist bailed on you. The bouquets. You got a last-minute batch of materials, and the bouquets would now have to be crafted by hand. There was no other time but now. You looked for a way out, but there was none. You had a $5 million ring that was about to be discovered missing any minute hidden in your palm, and you were going to have to pull an all-nighter in a room with eight other people. You thought you could get back into the cooler later and grab it, but they kept their flowers locked up. (standing in front of LACEY) So you had to have your specific bouquet or else. Lacey, you're not an unreasonable person. You're just a thief. Or at least you were a thief until Dietrich Mannheim called, told you that he was on to you. He wanted a piece of that action, too, or he was going to the police. You tried to talk him down, but he got rough. It got ugly. It was all spinning out of control. Eventually, they were going to find that body, so you started laying out clues. You sent the police off in all directions, because you'd grown up hearing all about crime scenes. I would say that's fortuitous, because you knew just what to leave, didn't you?

LACEY:
I have worked 18 hours a day on this wedding. I have sacrificed my weekends. I will not be treated this way.

SHAWN:
Then show us your bouquet, Lacey.

SHAWN looks back towards the detectives and starts to mouth "She's the" but then LACEY makes a run for it.

SHAWN:
Who, whoa, whoa! She's running? In those heels, really?

No one knows what to do. The guests and wedding party just stand there murmuring.

GUS:
We have to chase her, too?

SHAWN:
But we have no evidence except for that ring.

INT. CHAPEL, HALL, DAY

LACEY runs down the hallway and turns to her right. GUS, LASSITER, JULIET and VICK cut her off. She turns to run the other way and trips over the outstretched foot of an older guest asleep in a chair. LACEY falls into the gift table and the bouquet goes flying. GUS catches it. GUS reaches under the wrapping and pulls out the ring. SHAWN arrives the same LACEY had come.

SHAWN:
Dude, you're next.

MAXWELL brushes past SHAWN to go to LACEY.

INT. HOTEL, LOBBY, DAY

LASSITER is pulling SHAWN by the arm towards Registration.

SHAWN:
Come on. You're still angry, even after I solved your crime?

LASSITER:
Is this the man?

The BELLBOY looks over at BOBBY, who shakes his head.

BELLBOY:
No.

LASSITER:
This guy was not in my room?

BELLBOY:
I've never seen him before.

SHAWN:
You got a room? Why? We should have a party.

LASSITER:
Get out of my sight. (walks away)

SHAWN:
(fistbumps BELLBOY)(British accent) Thank you, Bobby. Interpol appreciates both of your efforts.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LACEY is taken away in handcuffs. SHAWN and GUS follow out of the room.

SHAWN:
I love weddings. Don't you?

GUS:
I didn't exactly think it was appropriate for you to give the toast.

SHAWN:
Well, the best man was unprepared. Someone had to step in. Besides, it was like a practice run for your wedding.

GUS:
(scoffs) You are not going to be my best man.

SHAWN:
You bet your ass I am. I've already picked out which song I'm singing at the altar.

GUS:
Really?

SHAWN:
You still like Ted Nugent? (GUS walks away) Remind me to show you your vows. They're going to make you cry. Gus... (follows after)

Episode 1x04 Woman Seeking Dead Husband, No Smokers, Pets Okay

1989

EXT SPENCER HOUSE, NIGHT

SHAWN and HENRY are hiding behind a log across the road from their house. HENRY is watching through binoculars

as SHAWN is sitting against the log facing the other way, less than thrilled to be there.

SHAWN:
How long do we have to wait?

HENRY:
Until we catch our bad guy.

SHAWN:
Can I sleep?

HENRY:
You can't sleep on a stakeout, Shawn. You can eat, you can chew gum... but you can't drink, because if you drink, you're going to have to pee, and the target always comes out right when you got to pee.

SHAWN:
Now I think I got to pee.

HENRY:
Well, then, Shawn, your bladder's going to get some training tonight, too. (sees someone walking towards the house) We got action. Now, I want you to stay...

SHAWN:
I know. I know, I know.

HENRY:
Shh. Go, go.

HENRY and SHAWN creep across the road and sneak up on their target The MAN peers into the back door. HENRY and SHAWN pause at the gate.

HENRY:
Come on.

HENRY and SHAWN move forward as the MAN bends over to pick up the newspaper on HENRY's porch. HENRY grabs him.

HENRY:
I got you! I got you red-handed, you lying son of a bitch. (mocking) "I don't know what happened to your newspaper, Henry". You're transparent, Clark. You didn't think I could nab a liar like you?

CLARK:
I can explain.

HENRY:
Tell it to the neighborhood watch association. (turns so CLARK is facing SHAWN) Give the paper to the boy, Clark.

CLARK hands the paper to SHAWN.

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is sitting behind VICK'S desk and starts to read the newspaper, his legs crossed on her desk. GUS walks in.

GUS:
What the hell are you doing?

SHAWN:
Checking baseball scores. My fantasy team is killing me.

GUS:
This is the Chief's office.

SHAWN:
I know. She runs the league. I'm kidding. She's in a meeting. She won't mind. Plus, we look really important hanging out in here. Gus, have you tried this chair? (stands) It's a pregnancy chair. (sits) We have to get one for the office, immediately. My birthing canal has never felt so in line.

GUS:
We need to get out of here.

SHAWN:
She told me to wait.

GUS:
For what?

SHAWN:
Gus, I'm not a mind reader.

GUS:
No, that's just what you tell everybody.

SHAWN:
I want you to try this chair. (stands and walks around the desk)

GUS:
I'm not trying that chair, Shawn.

SHAWN:
I'll sit on the birthing ball. (sits) I kid you not, that thing is like a refreshing waterfall cascading down your vertebrae. It might help with your stomach issues.

GUS:
Who told you I had stomach issues?

SHAWN:
Uh, my nose? The vent in the bathroom? Air fresheners all over the place?

GUS:
I'm trying a new medication for my lactose intolerance. (walks around desk)

SHAWN:
I believe the problem is physical, and I think it can be cured by what I am now referring to as... "the magic springy bounce-up chair".

GUS pokes the cushion on the chair as McNAB enters with drinks.

McNAB:
Hey, Shawn. Smoothies are here. (hands a cup to SHAWN)

SHAWN:
Pineapple?

McNAB:
Of course.

SHAWN:
Thanks, Buzz.

McNAB leaves and SHAWN slurps his smoothie through the straw.

GUS:
You're having food delivered?

SHAWN:
They were already going out.

GUS:
(annoyed) Oh, boy. I tell you...(sits in the chair and immediately relaxes) Wow.

SHAWN:
What did I tell you? (stands and walks over to GUS) Now, take a hit off this bad boy and complete the moment. You've earned it.

SHAWN hands GUS the smoothie and just as he is about the drink it, VICK enters.

VICK:
What do you think this is, Mr. Guster?

SHAWN:
I apologize. (GUS stands) This will never happen again. Give me that! (takes the smoothie)

VICK:
Boys, out.

SHAWN and GUS switch places with VICK.

SHAWN:
Gus, a smoothie? You know these things stain. (sips) Mmm. But they are very delicious. Chief, would you like some? (holds the cup out)

GUS:
That's not my smoothie.

VICK:
I don't care whose smoothie it is. I don't even remember why I asked you to stay now.

SHAWN:
You want us on that case, with the blond woman.

VICK:
No.

SHAWN:
Mm-hmm. Wintersby. Willachek? Whistlerbottom.

VICK:
No, no, it's...

SHAWN:
Wilcroft.

VICK:
No, that's not... Okay, wait a minute. Were you listening in on my conversation?

SHAWN:
I don't know if I heard it psychically or if I saw you walk by with her and Detective Lassiter, but I definitely heard the word "psychic".

VICK:
The woman, Raylene, said she visits an occasional psychic. She wasn't asking for one.

SHAWN:
Well, not in so many words.

VICK:
No, not in any words. This is a bank robbery case. We don't need psychics for a bank robbery case.

SHAWN:
Bank robbery?

VICK:
Mm-hmm.

SHAWN:
I didn't read anything in the paper about bank robbery.

VICK:
It was four years ago.

SHAWN:
So it went unsolved?

VICK:
It was solved.

SHAWN:
Well, then what does she need a psychic for? (GUS jabs him in the back) Gus, that is a perfectly reasonable question.

GUS:
Thank you, Chief. We'll be leaving now.

VICK sits.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm still confused.

VICK:
(stands) Her husband's partners are getting out of jail. This is a routine warning that we issue when someone may potentially be in danger.

SHAWN:
This is the part where we offer up our services.

GUS:
No, I think this is the part where we leave.

VICK:
That's a good idea.

SHAWN:
But we...

VICK:
(walks around the desk and ushers them out of the office) Believe it or not, Mr. Spencer, crimes were solved long before you got here, and they continue to be solved when you're not around. Oh, I remember what I wanted to tell you.

SHAWN:
What?

VICK:
Stay out of my chair. (closes doors)

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

GUS and SHAWN walk down the hall towards the exit.

SHAWN:
Bank robbers? Dude, that's awesome. We should go find Lassiter and our future client.

GUS:
We got to go.

SHAWN:
Dude, this woman is on an eternal quest for a good psychic. That's me! I'm going to go find her. (sips smoothie)

GUS:
I'm staying right here.

SHAWN:
Great idea. Wait 10 seconds and make an entrance. (hands GUS the smoothie) Drink some.

SHAWN turns back towards the bullpen as GUS sips the smoothie.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

RAYLENE walks into the bullpen with LASSITER and JULIET.

RAYLENE:
Are you saying that I'm in danger?

LASSITER:
Your husband's partners are being paroled today.

RAYLENE sits in the chair facing LASSITER'S desk. LASSITER sits on the edge of his desk and JULIET stands beside him.

LASSITER:
I have reason to believe their first order of business is going to be to try and find that lost money.

RAYLENE:
But the only person who knew where that money ended up was my husband.

LASSITER:
I know that, but do they?

SHAWN:
(enters) Hey, Lassie. Juliet. (looks at RAYLENE) I don't believe we've met. Or did we meet? (holds finger to temple) In a bank? No, that's not it. Why am I getting "bank"? Piggy bank? Sperm bank? Doesn't matter. I'm Shawn Spencer. I am the official head psychic here at the department.

LASSITER:
You don't have a title. And there is serious doubt as to whether you're really even psychic.

SHAWN:
I solved the McCallum disappearance. And the Summerland murder. (searches pockets) Oh, and I found your keys. (throws keys to LASSITER) And your badge. (throws badge to LASSITER)

LASSITER:
(fuming) Out.

GUS:
(walks in) Shawn, where are my keys?

LASSITER:
What? No. Out.

SHAWN looks at RAYLENE'S folder on LASSITER'S desk.

JULIET:
If you don't mind, we're a little busy. We have a...

SHAWN:
Excuse us, Raylene. (turns to leave)

RAYLENE:
Do we know each other?

SHAWN:
No, we don't. I'm sorry. Psychic, remember? Sometimes, I can't turn it off.

LASSITER rolls his eyes.

RAYLENE:
(stands) Do you do readings?

SHAWN:
We do it all. Full service.

RAYLENE:
I'm a bit of an enthusiast. I used to have a regular girl read for me.

GUS:
(pulls SHAWN back by his arm) Really? (takes a business card from his pocket) Uh, here's a card. We're at the beachfront location. I could put my cell number on the back if you have any questions. Anytime, really.

RAYLENE:
Thank you. You're so kind. (reads card) This is a pharmaceutical company.

SHAWN:
Like I said, we do it all.

RAYLENE:
Well, I always say, "a man with many hats... "

GUS:
"Doesn't like his haircut"?

RAYLENE:
Exactly. I thought I was the only one who read that book.

GUS:
That's my favorite.

RAYLENE:
Mine too.

GUS:
Really?

LASSITER clears his throat and GUS and RAYLENE stop their conversation, a little embarrassed.

SHAWN:
And... scene.

SHAWN and GUS leave. GUS looks back over his shoulder at RAYLENE.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is printing out newspaper reports about the bank robbery when GUS enters. GUS looks off-screen at something.

SHAWN:
Dude, what took you so long? This is good stuff. You've got to see what happened to this car. I mean, it was really... (looks in the same direction as GUS) What?

GUS walks forward and we see a big chunk of wall has been torn out with just some drywall left.

GUS:
What happened here?

SHAWN:
Oh, that? I had a drywaller come in and take out a wall.

GUS:
A wall? This is a rental. What do you think our landlord is going to say?

SHAWN:
Gee, I don't know. "Thank you"? Gus, this place was way too cramped.

GUS:
My name is on that lease.

SHAWN:
Don't worry. I'll make sure you get a thank-you note, too.

GUS:
You're taking my name off the lease, and the door, and these Frisbees. (picks up a neon-pink Frisbee bearing the logo)

SHAWN:
Gus, don't be ridiculous. Look, I'm almost positive this isn't a load-bearing wall, but if you're really concerned, why don't you go jump up and down in the attic and make sure.

GUS:
(sees RAYLENE in the waiting room) What is she doing here?

SHAWN:
Ah. She's our first real client.

GUS:
Actual client? Hired for the job?

SHAWN:
Actual client.

GUS looks at RAYLENE who smiles.

SHAWN:
Go on, man.

RAYLENE joins them in the office and SHAWN sits at his desk, feet up. GUS stands next to him.

RAYLENE:
I have to admit, when I met you at the police station, I was intrigued, so I checked your recent track record. It's amazing, really.

GUS:
Well, it's...it's a team effort.

SHAWN:
Not really. I do most of the work.

GUS:
What can we help you with, ma'am? (sits on the edge of the desk)

RAYLENE:
I need you to get in contact with someone.

SHAWN:
Well, tracking people down is our specialty. (GUS looks at him) What? Oh, it's not now?

RAYLENE:
This one might be a little tricky.

GUS:
How tricky? Is the person out of the state? Country?

RAYLENE:
He's dead.

SHAWN:
Ah, and I assume that's why you need a psychic.

RAYLENE nods.

GUS:
Hold on. Dead? Like dead-dead? Currently being eaten by worms?

RAYLENE:
He's actually entombed in a mausoleum.

SHAWN:
Gus, he's ascended to the next dimension. (to RAYLENE) It's fine.

GUS:
No, Shawn, I think we might be at a bit of an impasse.

SHAWN:
What exactly do you need to know?

As RAYLENE speaks, GUS gets up and walks away, his back to her.

RAYLENE:
My husband was not a perfect man. He got himself in a bit of trouble. Okay, I'll be honest, it was a lot of trouble. He got involved in a bank robbery. He was one of three, but the only one who didn't go to prison. Unfortunately, the reason he didn't get caught was that he drove his car down an embankment...

SHAWN:
Wait. (sits up) I see rain. No roads. No. (closes laptop showing article) There was a fiery crash, wasn't there?

RAYLENE:
Yes.

SHAWN:
What would you like me to ask, Raylene?

RAYLENE:
Well, this is hard to say, but he was the one designated to bury the money. They were to all meet later and divide the cash, only his partners were caught first.

GUS:
So why wait until now?

RAYLENE:
His partners think that I know where he hid the money. (starts to cry) If I don't give it to them, they're going to kill me.

GUS:
Shawn, can I speak to you outside, please?

SHAWN:
I... guess.

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS strides outside, SHAWN following.

SHAWN:
Dude, what is wrong with you?

GUS:
Shawn, I don't know how to break this to you, but you are not psychic.

SHAWN:
Clue me in on the problem here.

GUS:
It's a big problem when the job requires extensive conversing with the dead.

They both look through the window at RAYLENE in the office.

SHAWN:
Gus, what is the question that she wants answered? "Where is the money," right? That doesn't require any actual dead guy chit-chat. We simply trace his last steps, do a little research, ask a few questions, and bingo!

GUS:
Stop saying "bingo". You know how I hate that.

SHAWN:
Okay, fine. Yahtzee.

GUS:
We're not doing it, Shawn. (heads back inside)

SHAWN:
Mahjong! Gus! (follows)

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS walks back in followed by SHAWN. RAYLENE turns to face them.

GUS:
Mrs. Wilcroft...

RAYLENE:
Raylene.

GUS:
Raylene. Your problem is... outside of our reach.

Standing behind him, SHAWN shakes his head and mouths "It's not".

GUS:
You are in real danger.

SHAWN mouths something positive, hands in the air.

GUS:
I'd like to recommend police protection.

SHAWN mouths "We'll take the case!"

GUS:
I'm pleased to be of service. (shakes RAYLENE'S hand)

RAYLENE:
Thank you.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN winks at RAYLENE.

EXT. MOTEL, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET are in his car, eyes trained on a specific room.

LASSITER:
I know they're in there.

JULIET:
Just so you know, I am uncomfortable with intra-office romance.

LASSITER:
I wasn't considering it... and I'm completely uncomfortable with the implication.

JULIET:
So it wasn't true, the rumor about you and your last partner?

LASSITER:
I'm not going to dignify that with a response.

JULIET:
Mm-hmm.

Two men exit the room and walk towards the well-used car parked in front.

LASSITER:
This is them.

JULIET:
The bank robbers?

LASSITER:
Yeah, a bit worse for wear than the day I arrested them.

JULIET:
You caught them?

LASSITER:
I was part of a team, but yeah, it was mostly me.

JULIET:
That's a big deal.

LASSITER:
Would've been a big deal if I found the money and closed the case. Things like that make a career. Instead, I got a bunch of loose ends, a dead guy, and $3.6 million in cash that vanished into thin air.

JULIET watches as the men get into the car.

JULIET:
It's funny, they don't look so mean.

LASSITER:
What do you mean, "mean"?

JULIET:
They look like repairmen. Big repairmen, but they don't look like killers.

LASSITER:
Duck.

They both duck down as the car drives past. They get up and watch to see where it goes.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN has closed the door to the inner office and closed the blinds. Lit candles are on every available surface. There is a photo of RAYLENE'S husband standing on an easel. GUS opens the door to reveal RAYLENE and three other women sitting around a table holding hands. SHAWN is standing at one end wearing a loose blue robe that seems to billow through there is no wind inside. His arms are held out to his side as he chants.

SHAWN:
Eyes of a serpent, ears of a bat... send us a signal from...

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
(chant) I hear a voice.

GUS:
Can I see you outside, please?

SHAWN:
(chant) It wants me to come outside.

GUS:
Now?

SHAWN:
(chant) I should go.

With a sigh, SHAWN lowers his arms and uses his foot to turn off the fan that had been blowing on him. He stops in front of GUS by the door.

GUS:
Is that my bathrobe?

SHAWN precedes him into the outer office. GUS closes the door.

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm having a seance.

GUS:
You can't have a seance.

SHAWN:
Gus, there are no rules against having a seance. Anyone can have one. It's le a garage sale or plastic surgery.

GUS:
Okay, first of all, technically, you need to have a permit to have a garage sale. Secondly, you cannot speak to the dead.

SHAWN:
Oh, Gus, you don't understand at all, do you? I don't need to make contact with the dead. No, I need to speak with all the people in that room. They're witnesses. We can piece together the rest based on the information they give us. I'm already on to something. Check this out. The dead guy was on the lam for three days with the cash. He had help.

GUS:
From whom?

SHAWN:
I'm almost there.

They head back into the s√©ance room. SHAWN now sits at one end of the table, GUS at the other. They are all holding hands.

SHAWN:
Raylene?

RAYLENE:
Yes, Shawn?

SHAWN:
I'm sensing the last time he called, before the accident.

RAYLENE:
Ellen was the only one who talked to him.

The woman sitting across from RAYLENE opens her eyes at this betrayal.

SHAWN:
Ellen. Yes, I feel that deeply. You didn't tell the police that, did you?

ELLEN:
No, I was afraid. He's my brother. I didn't want to turn him in.

SHAWN:
No, of course not. Where did he call from?

ELLEN:
A pay phone outside a store.

SHAWN:
Yes, it was a store. I feel it. Which store?

ELLEN:
Uh, I think it was a... Thrifty Mart. Up north. He'd been driving. I... I've always imagined it was the one near... Pismo?

SHAWN:
Pismo! Yes. But the spirits are confused. They need more specific directions. Nearest... cross street?

ELLEN:
Uh, just past the park we used to hike with Roger.

SHAWN:
Who's Roger?

ELLEN:
(hesitates) He's our cousin.

SHAWN:
Really? But wait! There's more. The spirits are asking me... what is Roger's address?

ELLEN:
I really haven't seen Roger in years.

SHAWN:
(shouts) Come on, Ellen! Work with me! Think harder.

ELLEN:
Okay, sorry.

SHAWN:
How about a phone number?

GUS:
(stands in frustration) Okay.

SHAWN gasps at the broken circle.

SHAWN:
Gus, what have you done? You've broken the chain of spiritual trust.

GUS:
I didn't break anything.

ELLEN:
Don't ruin it for everyone, Gus.

GUS:
I'm not ruining anything. Listen, Raylene, I have to apologize to you. You seem like a very decent person, but what you need is protection, not this.

SHAWN buries his head in his hands.

GUS:
A bodyguard, a policeman. I can assure you, there is no spirit in here.

RAYLENE looks to SHAWN.

SHAWN:
(nervously) What?

GUS:
And let me make you a guarantee. There is absolutely no way there'll be any sort of contact with zombies...

At that moment, something is thrown through the window, shattering it. The women scream. Car tires are heard screeching as they drive away.

RAYLENE:
(to one of the women) You okay?

SHAWN rubs his hair, removing bits of glass.

SHAWN:
I think that's all for us tonight, ladies.

>>>LATER>>>

GUS peers through the closed blinds. SHAWN  creeps over and joins him.

GUS:
(whispers) Did you do that?

SHAWN:
(whispers) Why would I ruin our totally cool window?

GUS:
(whispers) For effect, to make me think you contacted an evil ghost.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Gus, please. Why didn't you float that idea by me sooner? That's genius. (looks out window) Somebody obviously wants us off this case.

GUS:
(whispers) I think it's those convicts. But whoever it is, we'll never find them. I just saw them run off.

SHAWN:
(whispers) You sure about that?

GUS:
(whispers) Yeah.

SHAWN:
Ladies, stay here. We're going after them... or it. (whispers to GUS) Let's get some tacos.

GUS:
Okay.

They leave the office.

INT. SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

GUS and SHAWN walk with JULIET, telling her what happened.

SHAWN:
And then the window just shattered.

JULIET:
And you think ghosts did it?

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, NIGHT

SHAWN:
No, no, no, no. Though there may have been some women present who thought ghosts were responsible.

GUS:
I blame it on the two convicts from the Holmby Bank robbery.

JULIET:
(puts file on her desk) I'm sorry, I still don't understand why that means you need to see the entire case file.

SHAWN:
Oh, no, Juliet, we don't need to see the whole thing. No, just the cover page, one or two others here or there. Definitely the witness list.

GUS:
Well, you got to see that.

JULIET:
And the Chief's okay with this?

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah!

GUS:
Yeah!

JULIET:
I don't think so.

SHAWN:
No?

JULIET:
No.

JULIET goes about her business, lifting a large file box onto her desk. GUS and SHAWN walk back into the hall.

INT. SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

GUS:
I liked the other girl better.

SHAWN:
Not me. Hey, since we're here, we should do some digging.

GUS:
Good idea. Why don't you dig me getting the hell out of here and going to get some sleep? (walks off)

SHAWN:
I set you up for that. Lobbed it right over the plate.

SHAWN watches GUS leave and sees that Office ALLEN is at the desk. He fakes a cough as he walks by.

ALLEN:
Mr. Spencer!

SHAWN:
Oh! (comes back) Hey, you. What a surprise. You look different.

ALLEN:
Yes, I took your advice. Three weeks without a cigarette.

SHAWN:
Well, it has certainly enhanced your aura. And remember, it wasn't my advice, it was your grandma's spirit.

ALLEN:
Have you spoken to her again?

SHAWN:
She's here.

ALLEN:
Now?

SHAWN:
Yes.

ALLEN:
Where? In this hallway?

SHAWN:
No. In the records room.

ALLEN:
(nods) I thought I felt something eerie in there.

SHAWN:
Me too. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed down there.

ALLEN:
Please. (holds up a ring with a large number of keys)

SHAWN gasps with feigned surprise.

INT. SBPD, RECORDS ROOM, NIGHT

ALLEN leads SHAWN into the darkened room and turns on the lights.

SHAWN:
No, no, no. Not too much light. You don't want to scare her away.

ALLEN dims the lights.

SHAWN:
Yes. (walks forward) Oh, yes. Yes, I can feel her, all right. (starts looking at the shelves) She's... she's over by the W's.

ALLEN:
Why?

SHAWN:
No. "W". (gasps) This is it.

ALLEN:
I'm nervous.

SHAWN:
Don't be. I want you to relax. Breathe. Close your eyes.

ALLEN closes her eyes and SHAWN grabs the box from the shelf and moves it to the lower one.

ALLEN:
Why would she be in the W's?

SHAWN:
I don't know. (looks through folders) Did you know any W's?

ALLEN:
That bastard Walter.

SHAWN:
Walter. (pulls out folder) Your ex? (reads)

ALLEN:
Wow! Yes. I hear something.

SHAWN:
Yes, me too.

ALLEN:
Paper!

SHAWN:
(writes on his hand) No. No, it's not paper.

ALLEN:
Yes, it's clearly paper.

SHAWN:
You have to concentrate. Breathe deeply.

SHAWN hurriedly puts away the file and folder.

ALLEN:
No. Uh-uh. I'm definitely not feeling anything anymore.

SHAWN puts the box back and resumes his vision pose just as ALLEN opens her eyes.

SHAWN:
I think we've lost her.

INT. SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN:
I'm so sorry I couldn't reach her.

ALLEN:
It's okay. (takes SHAWN'S hands) I know how temperamental the spirit world can...(sees the writing on his hand) Your hand!

SHAWN lets out an exaggerated gasp of astonishment.

ALLEN:
It was the spirits.

SHAWN:
Yes.

GUS:
It's a message from beyond. What does it say?

SHAWN:
(holds hand in front of his eyes) I think I should keep it to myself. It's a private message.

INT. GUS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM, DAY

GUS is asleep in bed when the lights come on. He wakes and sits up, startled. SHAWN is sitting on the windowsill.

SHAWN:
Dude, you look so peaceful when you're sleeping.

GUS:
(stands and points at SHAWN) Never come in my apartment again. You hear me?

SHAWN:
I've seen the Holmby Bank file.

GUS:
Look, Shawn, I don't want to...

SHAWN:
The cousin is the key. (stands)

GUS:
Which cousin? The one the sister mentioned?

SHAWN:
And then immediately regretted. You could see it. She let it slip. Dude, the guy runs a cemetery. Which one? Oh, I don't know, the one David Wilcroft is buried in? I'll bet you dollars to donuts he knows exactly where the money is. Look, it's all right here on my hand.

SHAWN holds up the hand he wrote on and GUS grabs it and turns it so he can read.

SHAWN:
His name is Roger Blaine, creepy as all-get-out. Lives on the grounds alone, no wife, no kids... (GUS points to a spot) Not that part. That's the Italian seamstress I met at the renaissance fair.

GUS drops SHAWN'S hand in disgust.

INT. ECHO, ON THE ROAD, DAY

GUS is behind the wheel as SHAWN eats.

GUS:
How much further is this place?

SHAWN:
I don't know. 50, 60 miles.

GUS:
60 miles? And you didn't get me a donut?

SHAWN:
I did get you a donut, and then I ate it.

GUS:
I can't believe I'm doing this.

SHAWN:
Solving a crime? That happens to be our job description.

GUS:
No, driving so far on a whim.

SHAWN:
"A whim", he says. A guy dies and gets buried by his own weirdo cousin in a tiny cemetery way up the coast in a town with a population of 200. That is not a whim. That is a clue.

GUS:
You think the cousin has the money?

SHAWN:
"Roger Blaine"? That even sounds like an alias. He could've killed Wilcroft. Or it could have been the sister. Gus, they're all kind of creepy. The dead guy, the undertaker, the sister, Raylene...

GUS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's nothing creepy about Raylene.

SHAWN:
Nothing creepy about the melodramatic widow?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Are you serious? Who marries a bank robber? Who sees a psychic every week?

GUS:
There's nothing wrong with her, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Okay, what is this thing you have with women in jeopardy? They have a name for this, you know. It's called the Stockholm syndrome.

GUS:
No, it's not.

SHAWN:
Florence Nightingale's disease?

GUS:
Are you trying to be funny? You can't ridicule me because I want to help.

SHAWN:
I can when you want to help too much. You have an unnatural affinity for this woman that I simply cannot wrap my brain around. She dresses like she's on her way to a PTA meeting.

GUS:
Fine. She reminds me of somebody who was very important to me.

SHAWN:
Who?

VICK:
Don't worry about it.

SHAWN:
Oh, no.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Don't say it.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Don't say Meredith Baxter Birney.

GUS:
It's not M.B.B.

SHAWN:
This is unhealthy.

GUS:
Okay, you were in love with her, too.

SHAWN:
I loved her because she was Mrs. Keaton and she gave birth to A.P.K.

GUS:
It's not her anyway.

SHAWN:
Well, who is it?

GUS:
My babysitter.

SHAWN:
Your babysitter?

GUS:
Yes, my babysitter.

SHAWN:
Gus, Mrs. Pilderman was in her late 60s.

GUS:
Mrs. Pilderman was 37 years old and she was a nurse, Shawn. She taught me things like, you know, about books and art. Things like that.

SHAWN:
Things like skinny-dipping.

GUS:
I did not go skinny-dipping with Mrs. Pilderman.

SHAWN:
Well, at least that sheds some light on it.

EXT. CEMETARY, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stand on the porch of BLAINE'S house. SHAWN knocks on the door.

SHAWN:
Huh. Nobody's home.

GUS:
No, somebody's here.

SHAWN:
You can see through doors now? That's the new thing?

GUS:
I can smell the laundry vent.

SHAWN:
No, you can't.

GUS:
Okay. (sniffs)

SHAWN:
Oh, Gus, please, with the supersmeller. You have to stop.

GUS continues to sniff and SHAWN starts to sniff as well.

SHAWN:
Oh, dude, I can smell it, too.

GUS:
I told you.

SHAWN:
Jeans and socks and underwear and a Bounce sheet.

GUS:
Make jokes. How long do you think it takes to dry a load of clothes? 30 minutes? Somebody's here and not answering the door. (bends over to pick through curtains)

SHAWN:
Gus, I apologize. That's very impressive detective work. I feel a little bad about the donut thing now.

GUS:
You should.

SHAWN:
(tries the door but it's locked) Dang it! Let's try the back.

They run down the stairs and peek around the corner of the house. They pause and then creep along the path to the back. SHAWN backs up against the house as GUS peers around him. SHAWN points down and then waggles his fingers in front of his eyes before crowing. GUS grabs his hand and shoves it down.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Just stay and watch. Go on, G.

SHAWN creeps around to the backstairs and climbs up them sideways. Just as he reaches the door, it opens abruptly from inside. SHAWN is startled by the man.

SHAWN:
Whoa!

GUS comes running over.

SHAWN:
You're not Roger. No. No, no, you're, uh...(flashes on photos) You're David Wilcroft. Aren't you supposed to be dead?

GUS faints. SHAWN looks at him.

SHAWN:
Gus? Gus?

INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE, DAY

WILCROFT walks them through the kitchen to the living room.

WILCROFT:
Look, it's not that easy to explain. I'm not a real criminal. I just... I got in a little over my head.

GUS:
You robbed a bank.

WILCROFT:
I didn't want to. I was in a bad place. They trusted me. I was supposed to stash the cash.

SHAWN:
(sees the mud on WILCROFT'S shoes and jeans) You lost the money.

WILCROFT:
Yeah. How'd you know?

SHAWN:
(puts his hand to his head and flashes on the articles) Uh... it was...it was raining really hard for two whole days.

WILCROFT:
It was the worst rainstorm in 30 years.

SHAWN:
You couldn't find it.

WILCROFT:
Yeah, by the time the roads reopened, every marker I left was gone. It was washed away. I lost three and a half million dollars. Driving back, I nearly drove off the road. It was then I realized I'd be better off dead.

SHAWN:
And you have been digging ever since.

WILCROFT:
Every chance I can get out there without the risk of being seen by hikers or mountain bikers, I dig.

GUS:
You know what? Raylene is in agony over this.

WILCROFT:
I didn't mean her any harm.

GUS:
You were never going to tell her?

WILCROFT:
I couldn't.

SHAWN:
Excuse us a moment.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Gus, what's happening with you and this guy's wife? Are you having feelings for this woman?

GUS:
That's ridiculous.

SHAWN:
No, no, Gus. Gus, this is wonderful. Look, we didn't know he was alive. When she came to us, she was technically available...

GUS:
Shawn, stop it. (to WILCROFT) I'm not hitting on your wife.

SHAWN:
No, he's not, but there is some serious crushing here. Dude, I am not blind. "A man with many hats doesn't like his haircut"? What? What book is that from?

GUS:
She's a charming woman.

SHAWN:
"A charming woman"? Oh, you're Jane Austen now? She is an adult, she is attractive, she is mature.

GUS:
Shawn...

SHAWN:
David, help me out here. Tell him that this is healthy.

WILCROFT:
Raylene is a very dynamic woman. Everybody's drawn to her. Look, guys, I know you want to turn me in. But you've got to understand, I am close. I am so very close. I've covered nearly every inch inside the Kalish trail loop where I buried it.

GUS:
And you want us to let you find it?

WILCROFT:
Get her to hide someplace, someplace safe. I just want to return the money and get on with my life.

SHAWN:
We have to think this through.

GUS:
Yeah.

GUS and SHAWN head for the door.

WILCROFT:
You know, in my mind, they were the lucky ones, they got to go to prison, pay off their debt to society. I've been living as a dead man. If Raylene's going to find out that I'm alive, at the very least don't let it come from a stranger, let it come from me.

EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk to the car.

GUS:
We're letting him go?

SHAWN:
He's not going anywhere until he finds that money. I doubt that'll be anytime soon. He did have cool hair, though. We're missing something else here. He's the key to solving this puzzle.

GUS:
(looks at SHAWN over the car) We need to tell Raylene.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're holding all the cards. Why would we do that?

GUS:
Because she's in danger.

SHAWN:
Maybe we can fix that.

They get into the car.

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS: (v.o.)
Your husband, he's alive.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
Gus!

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

RAYLENE is sitting on a chair in front of GUS' desk. SHAWN and GUS are standing.

SHAWN:
Remember the part where we weren't going to tell her?

GUS:
We never said that.

RAYLENE:
David's alive?

GUS:
We found him. He's with his cousin.

SHAWN can't believe that GUS has gone against the plan because of his feelings towards RAYLENE.

RAYLENE:
Roger? No, no, no. That can't be.

SHAWN:
I'm sure your head is spinning, and that you don't feel completely safe right now. But rest assured, we do have a plan. We are going to put the convicts back in jail.

GUS:
Where they belong.

SHAWN:
And are going to stay for a while.

EXT. STREET, DAY

The two convicts walk into a liquor store. Across the street, LASSITER and JULIET watch from his car.

LASSITER:
We'll put these guys behind bars where they belong.

INT. LASSITER'S CAR, DAY

While LASSITER looks through binoculars, JULIET removes an old fast food take-out tray from the dash.

JULIET:
Ugh. (puts it in the back seat) So, who authorized this stakeout?

LASSITER:
What?

JULIET:
You know, who set it up?

LASSITER:
I did.

JULIET:
I mean, who sanctioned it? Approved it? Above you.

LASSITER:
Above me? You know, I don't think I like where this is going.

JULIET:
I just mean it should be officially sanctioned  as per the police code.

LASSITER:
Which one?

JULIET:
11a-17.

LASSITER:
Ticky-Tack. Doesn't apply.

JULIET:
In most cases, someone still has to authorize it.

LASSITER:
Oh, that's right, I remember now. I did!

JULIET:
What about 42.211?

LASSITER:
What about it?

JULIET:
Well, it states that...

LASSITER:
It's superseded by 15.75.

JULIET:
Not necessarily.

LASSITER:
If you're in the jurisdiction Of a 23.40, it is.

JULIET:
Maybe.

LASSITER:
"Maybe"?

SHAWN pops up in the back seat.

SHAWN:
Technically, a 23.40 only applies in federal cases.

LASSITER:
(looks at SHAWN) What are you doing in here?

SHAWN:
I thought we could share info. What are we looking at? (reaches for binoculars on dash)

LASSITER:
(slaps SHAWN'S hand) Get out of my car!

SHAWN:
Shouldn't you be wondering how I slid in and lounged for two minutes without you noticing? (to JULIET) You're new and pretty, so it's okay.

LASSITER:
You've got 10 seconds before I latch the doors and haul you down to the station.

SHAWN:
(sing-song) They don't know where the money is.

JULIET:
What?

SHAWN:
Isn't that why you're following them? So they'll lead you to the money? Psychic. It's amazing. You'll get used to it. Look, the dead guy buried the money and then lost it, but that's beside the point. I think we can cut our losses, and put these two back behind bars, if we work together.

JULIET:
And how do we do that?

SHAWN:
First, we dress up as musketeers and make a very special pact. (puts his hand out in front, palm down, waiting for the other to put their hands on his) Come on, you watched them pull at least a handful of probation violations. You've been tailing them. You saw what they did to my office.

JULIET:
They haven't been anywhere near your office.

SHAWN:
They were near enough to bust out my window two nights ago.

LASSITER:
No, you're wrong.

SHAWN:
You lost them, anyway.

LASSITER looks back at the liquor store to see the two men are gone.

SHAWN:
We'll talk tomorrow. Bye, Juliet. (gets out of the car)

LASSITER grips the steering wheel with both hands and breathes deep to control his frustration. Around the corner, GUS drives up and SHAWN runs over and gets in the car.

INT. ECHO, DAY

SHAWN puts on his seatbelt.

GUS:
They don't want our help?

SHAWN:
Of course they don't, but they also lost our guys. Did you see where they went?

GUS:
Did I see where they went? You mean, did I see their car turn right on Riverside? Or did I see the parking tag from the 2400 motel?

SHAWN:
Touch√©. Did you see what kind of whiskey they bought?

GUS:
Shawn, please. Time is being wasted.

SHAWN chuckles as GUS drives.

EXT. 2400 MOTEL, NIGHT

SHAWN is trying to unlock the door to the bank robbers' room

GUS:
This is breaking and entering.

SHAWN:
No, no, no. Only if we break something. And then enter something. Entering is just "entering".

GUS:
I'm not breaking the law, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Look, you want to save your little widow? We've got to find some evidence to put these guys away.

GUS:
I'm standing firm on this.

SHAWN looks down at GUS' feet and gives up on the door.

SHAWN:
Fine. What about the window? If it just opens, does that count?

GUS:
Depends.

SHAWN gets the window open a crack and peers in. GUS sees something behind SHAWN.

SHAWN:
I see something.

GUS:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
I might be able to slide this chain off. (tries to move chain from the top of the window)

GUS:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
Gus, I'm trying to concentrate.

GUS:
You might want to turn around.

SHAWN:
What? (turns to see the bank robbers, one aiming a gun at him) Whoa! You guys parked around back, huh?

GUS and SHAWN slowly raise their hands.

INT. 2400 MOTEL ROOM, NIGHT

GUS and SHAWN are pushed into the room.

SHAWN:
Okay, okay! Was that really necessary? Were we resisting?

ROBBER 1:
Man, window inspector? In a motel? (takes off jacket)

SHAWN:
Okay, I lied. I did. I'm sorry. The truth is I'm a psychic. That's what I do.

ROBBER 2:
I've been in jail four years.

SHAWN:
You don't have papers? I thought you guys had TV and yard darts and Mah-Jongg and... (GUS smacks him) Okay. I... I... I, uh... I come bearing a message... from a departed being. David Wilcroft... wants you to know that he lost the money. It's gone forever.

ROBBER 1:
Why are you telling us this?

SHAWN:
Uh, he...he is concerned that you're going to harm... rins... rackle...

GUS:
Raylene.

SHAWN:
Raylene.

The two robbers laugh.

ROBBER 1:
Oh, that's funny.

SHAWN and GUS join in the laughter.

SHAWN:
That is funny.

ROBBER 1:
(sobers instantly) Jesse, can you make sure that we are not disturbed?

JESSE backs away to the door.

SHAWN:
You can...

JESSE goes outside, closing the door.

ROBBER 1:
Can you prove you're a psychic?

SHAWN:
Sure. Sure. Uh... uh, you are... a bank robber. Yes. You... did not like prison. (sees dirt on the hem of ROBBER 1's pants) You are wearing the same pants that you were released in, and you have... you've packed on a few pounds since being incarcerated...

ROBBER 1:
No, look, man, I'm talking about real proof. Like a test. Now, look, if you're right, you live. If you're wrong... Man, you don't want to be wrong.

SHAWN:
Here's the thing. It's not really a parlor trick...

ROBBER 1:
No.

SHAWN:
And... And I don't want to cheapen it.

ROBBER 1:
Look, prove it now. Let's go. (pushes SHAWN onto the couch) What's wrong with you? Move.

GUS:
(sits in chair) Okay, okay.

ROBBER 1 stands with his back to the TV and puts his other hand behind his back.

ROBBER 1:
How many fingers?

SHAWN:
H... How many, uh... fingers? What, are you...Are you kidding? I mean... (pours himself a glass of water from the metal pitcher on the table)

ROBBER 1:
Do I look like I'm joking around? How many fingers?

SHAWN:
We've got to be able to come up with something better.

ROBBER 1:
All right, man. Time's up.

SHAWN sees ROBBER 1's hand reflected in the TV and the pitcher.

SHAWN:
Four. (sits back and sips water)

ROBBER 1:
All right, how many now?

SHAWN:
(glances at the pitcher) Two. Now, can we move on? Because Gus and I have some questions that we...

ROBBER 1 changes his fingers to three and SHAWN checks the pitcher.

SHAWN:
Three. For instance, why was it so funny when...Three. And is it possible... Still three.

ROBBER 1 is undecided.

SHAWN:
Now it's technically two and a half fingers. And... the guy with the gun is flipping me the bird.

ROBBER 1:
You can see my fingers, can't you?

SHAWN:
No, no. Yes. Yes, I can. It's the reflection of the TV bouncing off the mirror to the... to the water pitcher here.

ROBBER 1:
Okay, maybe not. We're going to try this one more time. (moves in front of GUS) Now, how many fingers?

SHAWN looks at GUS who shows him three fingers.

SHAWN:
Dude... you need to stop picking three.

ROBBER 1:
(lowers gun) Respect, man. (fist bumps SHAWN) Oh, man, that's... yeah.

EXT. 2400 MOTEL, NIGHT

LASSITER and JULIET pull into the parking lot and see the light on in the room.

LASSITER:
Yep. They're back here.

JULIET:
I can't believe we lost them.

LASSITER:
Don't think that wasn't on purpose.

LASSITER puts the car in park.

INT. 2400 MOTEL ROOM, NIGHT

JESSE is back inside and is sitting next to SHAWN on the couch. All but GUS have beers.

SHAWN:
(toasts) To Wilcroft!

ROBBER 1:
A hell of a wheel man. (sits on SHAWN'S other side)

SHAWN:
He was the wheel man?

ROBBER 1:
Yeah. You should know that, right?

GUS:
Well, Shawn's visions sometimes are scattered. Incomplete.

SHAWN:
How does a wheel man miss a turn on a mountain road?

JESSE:
Oh, I tell you what, he didn't miss that turn. I bet he just drove straight off. You want to know why?

SHAWN:
(slowly looks to GUS) Because he was trying to get away from his... wife.

ROBBER 1:
Damn, you're good!

GUS:
Hey, no, no. That's... That can't be. Why would he be...

ROBBER 1:
We called her "The Viper". Man, she was cold as hell. We had to do whatever she said, man. We had no choice.

GUS:
Who?

ROBBER 1:
The wife.

GUS:
Raylene?

ROBBER 1:
You know her?

GUS:
Well, she came to us, she wanted to contact David.

ROBBER 1:
Figures. That was her only weakness. The occult. Man, she'd stop at nothing to get her hands on that money.

GUS:
No, she only wanted that money to protect herself from you two.

Both men point to themselves.

ROBBER 1:
From... from us?

GUS:
Yeah.

The robbers laugh.

ROBBER 1:
Man, the last thing we would ever do is cross her. All we wanted to do was get away from her. Especially David.

SHAWN looks sadly at GUS.

ROBBER 1:
She ran him around like he was an animal. He did whatever she said. (looks to SHAWN) Look, man, I don't know if you guys got caught up in the charm or whatever, but I'll tell you, man, that was her key. She could play anybody. I'm telling you, she's a very dangerous lady.

GUS:
Raylene was the mastermind?

SHAWN:
Whoo! I already knew that... because I'm a psychic. Come on, guys. We should go.

SHAWN and the robbers stand up. SHAWN shakes ROBBER 1's hand. JESSE peers out the window.

JESSE:
Uh... you don't want to go out that way.

SHAWN:
Why?

JESSE:
We got company outside. (sees LASSITER and JULIET)

SHAWN:
Is there another way out of here?

INT. ECHO, ON THE ROAD, NIGHT

SHAWN is driving while keeping an eye on the rearview mirror.

GUS:
I can't believe I just crawled through a bathroom window. It has to be a lie.

SHAWN:
Gus, you're attracted to dangerous women, man. It happens. Joan Jett, for example. Penny Marshall. Grace Jones. Or the woman who played Pinky Tuscadero.

GUS:
She seemed so sincere. So vulnerable, you know?

SHAWN:
Yeah, turns out she's a domineering snake lady who drove her browbeaten husband to fake his own death. And we... we led her right to the poor bastard.

GUS:
Man.

SHAWN:
Lizzie Borden. Kathy Bates.

EXT. MAUSOLEUM, NIGHT

GUS parks the car right in front of the mausoleum and the two run inside.

INT. MAUSOLEUM, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS run into a room where they see RAYLENE.

GUS:
Raylene, this is not...

RAYLENE turns to face them with a gun in her hand. They stop short.

SHAWN:
Whoa! What, today's gun day?

RAYLENE:
Sit. (points to bench)

GUS and SHAWN sit down.

GUS:
"Just rush in here". Bad idea, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Let her hang herself.

RAYLENE:
Quiet!

SHAWN:
(puts hand to head) Raylene, I'm sensing (stands) that this is going to end very, very badly.

RAYLENE:
Find me my money. (looks to WILCROFT) I know you have it.

SHAWN:
He doesn't have it. I'm the only one who knows where the money is.

GUS:
Whoa, whoa. (stands) He doesn't know where the money is.

SHAWN:
(clenched jaw) Of course I know where the money is.

GUS:
Shawn, I don't know what your strategy is, but you don't know where the money is.

RAYLENE:
You have five seconds. One...

SHAWN:
Really?

RAYLENE:
Two...

SHAWN:
The countdown?

RAYLENE:
Three!

SHAWN:
(jumps on the bench) Okay. It's in the crypt.

RAYLENE:
The money's in the crypt?

SHAWN:
(jumps onto WILCROFT'S bench) David here certainly isn't. (jumps to the floor) Think about it, Raylene. Roger runs the place. It's the perfect hiding spot. They can get in and out whenever they want.

RAYLENE:
(to WILCROFT) Pry it open.

WILCROFT:
With what?

RAYLENE:
(looks around) With the stanchion.

WILCROFT gets up and walks to the stanchion.

SHAWN:
Huh. (walks to GUS) Apparently, those are called "stanchions," Gus. Were you aware of this?

GUS:
Yes, I was. How did you figure out that money was in the crypt?

SHAWN:
(whispers) I'm bluffing.

GUS:
(whispers) This is not a good time to bluff.

SHAWN:
I think it's a great time. She was going to kill us. And besides, I've always thought a crypt was a great place to stash loot, you know?

WILCROFT approaches the crypt with the stanchion.

SHAWN:
It's kind of like a vault. You can just get in there whenever you need to.

GUS:
She's going to figure out you're lying!

SHAWN:
Eventually. But come on, it's going to take a while to bust open a crypt.

They hear a crash and turn around to see that WILCROFT has broken open a section of the crypt.

SHAWN:
(turns back to GUS) Wow. Not as long as I was hoping for.

RAYLENE:
Help him get it out.

GUS:
Raylene, please...

RAYLENE:
What are you waiting for?

SHAWN hears the door open.

SHAWN:
That.

ROBBER 1 and JESSE enter.

ROBBER 1:
Son of a...

JESSE:
David.

GUS:
I don't believe this.

SHAWN:
What are you going to do, Raylene? Shoot all of us?

RAYLENE:
None of you are armed. I can do whatever I want.

The robbers slowly raise their hands.

JULIET:
Really, now?

JULIET aims her gun at RAYLENE. LASSITER approaches from the other side.

LASSITER:
Drop it.

RAYLENE puts her gun on the bench and LASSITER picks it up and puts it in his pocket.

LASSITER:
(to WILCROFT) You, move away from the stanchion.

WILCROFT puts the stanchion down and sits back on the bench.

SHAWN:
Uh... what took you so long?

LASSITER:
Shut up.

JULIET cuffs RAYLENE and LASSITER cuffs WILCROFT. The detectives take their prisoners out.

GUS:
He does have nice hair.

SHAWN:
Yeah, that takes a lot of upkeep, though, man.

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
You've got to worry about split ends...

GUS:
Dandruff.

SHAWN:
Dandruff.

GUS:
It's horrible.

SHAWN:
It's awful.

GUS:
Yeah. Let's get out of here.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER, JULIET, SHAWN and GUS follow VICK.

VICK:
The Wilcrofts are not talking at all to our investigators.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

LASSITER, JULIET, SHAWN and GUS stand in front of the desk as VICK walks around behind it.

VICK:
We get indications from their lawyers that they will plead the fifth to all charges, which leaves me with a whole slew of loose ends. For instance, Detective Lassiter, could you tell me how you made the discovery that David Wilcroft was still alive?

LASSITER:
Well, actually, Chief, we never made that connection, per se. We were on a stakeout.

VICK:
Yes, I see that. (reads report) You describe it as... "harrowing and intense".

JULIET:
I'm sorry. Those were my words. (to LASSITER) You wanted me to spell-check it.

VICK:
I still don't understand how that connected you to David Wilcroft.

GUS:
Well, that's where we come in, Chief. Some good work was done...

SHAWN:
By Detective Lassiter. He was amazing. He figured out there was a connection to Roger Blaine, the cousin, who was involved with the faking of the death. Burnt body, no DNA, pretty convenient, he deducted.

LASSITER:
I never said that.

SHAWN:
No, but you thought it. That's how good you are, Lassie. You practically solved this entire case up here, (taps head) without uttering a single word.

LASSITER:
I did nothing of the kind. I was following the money and protecting Raylene.

VICK:
Who turned out to be the dangerous one.

SHAWN:
Which I picked up from Detective Lassiter's massive brain.

LASSITER:
Not true.

SHAWN:
True.

LASSITER:
Not.

SHAWN:
It was so.

VICK:
Gentlemen, please. So we still have no idea where the money is?

SHAWN puts his hand on LASSITER'S head. LASSITER shoves it away.

SHAWN:
I got nothing from him. But if he figures anything out, I'll be the first to know.

LASSITER:
Would you excuse us for a moment? (grabs SHAWN and spins him around, keeping a grip on the back of his neck) We're going to have a private conversation.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER:
I know what you're doing.

SHAWN:
Giving you credit.

LASSITER:
Trying to get me to admit you're psychic.

SHAWN:
You've already done that.

LASSITER:
No, I haven't.

SHAWN:
(pauses to think) You're right. I'm sorry, you didn't actually say it.

LASSITER:
Spencer, no matter what you do, I will never, never, ever say those words.

SHAWN:
Which words?

LASSITER:
You know which words.

SHAWN:
No, man, I lost my train of thought. Which words?

LASSITER only smirks at him. SHAWN puts one hand on LASSITER'S head and pinches the detective's nose with the other. He soon lets go.

SHAWN:
Oh. (loudly) That you think I'm a psychic. (those in the office look at them) Those words? So when are you going to tell them where the money is?

LASSITER:
I don't know where the money is.

SHAWN:
Sure you do. You're seeing... dirt. Am I right?

LASSITER:
No!

SHAWN:
What am I going to say now? (goes back into the office)

EXT, HIKING TRAILS, DAY

GUS parks the car near the beginning of the trails and he and SHAWN get out.

GUS:
What are we doing here?

SHAWN:
It's Saturday. I thought we'd get some fresh air.

GUS:
We drove an hour out of town to get some fresh air?

SHAWN:
Well, there's that...(opens the back to reveal shovels - and takeout) and...(takes out shovels) and we're going to find the dread pirate Wilcroft's dirty booty.

GUS:
Shawn, the guy's been digging for four years. We're going to find it in one afternoon?

SHAWN:
90 minutes, tops. (brings out the takeout) And I brought some chicken for a hearty snack.

GUS:
And how do you plan on finding it?

SHAWN:
Well, he said he dug up every inch of the Kalish loop after he buried it here, right?

GUS:
Yes, three miles' worth.

SHAWN:
But it was dark, and it had rained. And he said he thought it was right off the path. He may have gotten lost.

GUS:
I heard the story, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Did he realize that there is a "J" Kalish and an "L" Kalish trail? Dude, it's completely defunct. Check it out. (gives GUS map) Only used by the Rangers for back fires, medical access, mud slide emergency routes, like, for instance, during a torrential rainstorm. Otherwise, it's gated, and it looks completely abandoned from the road.

GUS:
Okay, I find it, (takes a dinner) I get credit. (picks up a shovel and starts down the trail)

SHAWN:
I'm the psychic. I have to get a vibration. (closes back of car and follows) "Chief?" "Yes?" "I'm getting a trailhead, a pathway...and something else." "What is it?" "Chicken bones. Yes, Tandoori style." "Fresh." "Oh, I bet they were delicious." "Yes."

Episode 1x05 9 Lives

1985

EXT. SPENCER HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and HENRY are eating breakfast outside at the picnic table. HENRY is reading the newspaper. SHAWN slurps the milk from his empty cereal bowl before reaching for the box to put more in. Nothing comes out. He slams the box on the table.

SHAWN:
This isn't happening to me!

HENRY:
What is happening to you, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Only the worst thing ever! A missing Captain Delicious magic mood ring! Dad, this is a crime. Can you have them arrested?

HENRY:
(looks up from paper) First of all, Shawn, no, this is not a crime.

SHAWN:
Can't you just haul them in for questioning? Lay into them a little?

HENRY:
And who is "them"?

SHAWN:
You know, the cereal people?

HENRY:
Oh, the cereal people, huh? Well, I'll tell you what, Shawn, you can spend a lot of time calling 411 to get the number for your cereal people, they're gonna stick you on hold forever, listening to bad music. Finally, you're gonna get some dimwitted secretary, who's gonna take your message, and then she's gonna throw it in a waste bucket. Or you can use the skills I taught you and you can outsmart them.

SHAWN turns the cereal box about in his hands, looking at all sides.

SHAWN:
What am I missing?

HENRY takes the box and sets down in front of SHAWN.

HENRY:
Where is the ring?

SHAWN:
Well, it'd be at the bottom.

HENRY:
Not in this box, you're right. The big old bad cereal company messed up. (takes a new box and sets it in front of SHAWN) So, you grab another box, tough luck. Where's the ring now?

SHAWN:
At the bottom. Now I got to eat the whole box.

HENRY:
(turns box upside-down) And where's the ring now?

SHAWN:
At the top!

HENRY:
(opens box) That's right. You see, sometimes, Shawn, you don't have to dig so deep. All you gotta do is turn something upside down to make it right side up. And then... (takes out ring) you get your prize.

SHAWN:
Thanks, Dad!

PRESENT DAY

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are strolling the sidewalk. SHAWN is eating Chinese food from take-out container and GUS is carrying a coffee and closed take-out container.

GUS:
Explain to me again why we couldn't sit in a restaurant and eat like civilized people.

SHAWN:
Moving is good, Gus, it helps the digestion. Plus, you and I never do this anymore.

GUS:
What? Eat and jog?

SHAWN:
No, talk. Just talk. Check in with each other, as men. I wanna know how you are. I wanna know how Gus is.

GUS:
Really? Like you're really asking me?

SHAWN:
Yes, I'm really asking, because I care.

GUS:
Wow, okay. Well, we've been working cases nonstop for a month. To be honest, I'm burnt. I just want to take a nap.

SHAWN:
I couldn't agree with you more, buddy. I think we should lay low for a bit. No more cases.

GUS:
Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that. I was kind of worried about telling you.

SHAWN:
Don't be a silly goose. Now, we've had a good talk, I think we both felt it, and look at this. Here we are.

They stop at a crime scene.

GUS:
What is this, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Okay, here's the thing. The police may have found a body, which I may have picked up on my police scanner, which I may have brought with me. (takes scanner from back pocket)

GUS:
No cases, Shawn.

SHAWN starts towards the building and GUS reluctantly follows.

SHAWN:
No cases. We go in, we see. We say hello. And we leave.

GUS:
Say hello? This is a crime scene. You can't just walk in there.

SHAWN:
(sees BUZZ standing guard) McNab. Nabby! (to GUS)  Buzz.

GUS:
Buzz? Seriously?

SHAWN:
That's his first name. Don't you ever talk to him?

GUS:
Why would I talk to anybody named Buzz?

BUZZ:
Shawn! My man!

SHAWN walks up to BUZZ where they clasp hands, point at each other, bump elbows before BUZZ goes one step further to bump hips.

SHAWN:
Okay with... Yes. You look trim. Somebody made their wedding weight.

BUZZ:
Five more pounds. I'm close. But I still have a month.

SHAWN:
You'll get there. You remember my partner?

BUZZ:
Sure, yeah. Matt, right?

GUS:
Gus.

BUZZ:
Right.

SHAWN:
So, what do you got going on up there? Don't hold out on me now.

BUZZ:
Looks like suicide. A guy from the phone company found the victim in his apartment. Been up there for a few days already.

SHAWN:
Few days? You mind if we head up, take a look, poke around a little?

BUZZ:
Oh, I don't know. Lassiter's up there and he's in a mood.

SHAWN:
Yeah, we just, uh, got his coffee. (takes cup from GUS) Wanted to bring it by, make it right.

BUZZ:
Oh, that's nice of you. He asked me to get it, but this is perfect.

BUZZ lifts the police tape and SHAWN and GUS duck underneath and head up the stairs. SHAWN sips the coffee.

BUZZ:
Hey, did you just sip that?

SHAWN:
(turns around) You don't taste Lassiter's coffee before you give it to him? That surprises me, Buzz. He's so particular. No cream, no sugar...

BUZZ:
It's three creams, four sugars.

SHAWN:
Yeah, it is.

BUZZ realizes SHAWN was testing him.

SHAWN:
Sharp as a tack.

BUZZ:
You!

SHAWN:
And fit!

BUZZ turns around and SHAWN and GUS continue up the steps. At the top, SHAWN throws away the coffee before going inside.

INT. VICTIM'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM, DAY

The body of an older, heavy-set man lies on the couch. An open bottle of pills rests beside him, some spilled on the cushion. SHAWN and GUS sneak in while LASSITER and JULIET are looking the other way.

JULIET:
We found a note. The body's been here at least three days. Maybe more. All signs point to a 11-44.

LASSITER:
(writes notes) Three 11-44s in four months? There must be something in the water.

JULIET:
Uh-huh.

SHAWN and GUS stop at the piano and face away from the detectives.

LASSITER:
(walks to center of room) All right, ladies and gentlemen, listen up. You know the procedure. I want this done right. I do not want any mistakes.

A forensics officer blows into an evidence bag to open it before placing the pill bottle inside.

LASSITER:
Hey, Blowie, I know you're new, but next time if you want to get your spit all over the evidence, why don't you just lick it?

INT. VICTIM'S APARTMENT, DINING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS slip out of the living room while LASSITER talks to the forensics officer.

SHAWN:
Clearly he doesn't need any more coffee.

GUS:
Okay, there is the dead guy. Can we go now?

SHAWN:
Relax. We just got here. Have some mee krob. (holds up take-out)

GUS:
How do you just eat when there's a dead guy laying there?

SHAWN:
What, is that rude? Am I supposed to share?

The Forensics officer heads their way.

GUS:
Forensics.

Forensics walks past them and into the kitchen. They follow.

INT. VICTIM'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS slip out of the living room while LASSITER talks to the forensics officer.

GUS:
Act natural.

They lean back against the door in their "natural" pose. SHAWN gasps as the Forensics officer opens a spice cabinet.

SHAWN:
That's it!

GUS:
What? What do you see?

Forensics moves on.

SHAWN:
Red pepper flakes.

GUS:
Is that a clue or something?

SHAWN:
No, it's a delicious spice, and it's exactly what my mee krob needs. I told you this. (goes to cabinet and takes flakes)

GUS:
What are you doing? This is a crime scene. You can't touch stuff.

SHAWN looks into the refrigerator as Forensics opens it and sees a marinating steak.

GUS:
What?

The forensics man leaves the kitchen

SHAWN:
Seriously, check this out.(goes to the fridge and opens door) A marinating steak?

GUS:
What, you want to eat that, too?

SHAWN:
No, but don't you find that a little odd?

GUS:
That a man would eat a steak?

SHAWN:
No, that a man who was ready to kill himself would take the time to marinate a steak for a future meal? (closes the fridge) Dude, (picks up take-out) this was not suicide. This was murder.

They leave the kitchen.

INT. VICTIM'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stride into the living room and SHAWN sees the latch on the apartment door is open.

SHAWN:
The door latch is still intact. (turns to GUS) Now I ask you. If you were gonna kill yourself, wouldn't you want the door to be locked so that no one could barge in on you right in the middle?

LASSITER walks up behind SHAWN and GUS tries to get him to turn around.

SHAWN:
What? I don't...What is it? I don't...(turns around)

LASSITER:
What in the name of sweet justice are you two doing in my crime scene?

SHAWN:
Your crime scene? That's funny. I didn't see your name on it anywhere.

LASSITER:
(mocks) Get out.

SHAWN:
We are. Just thought you might wanna know that this thing here, not a suicide.

LASSITER:
Great. Thanks for that. Really. And thanks also for bringing a snack to the crime scene.

SHAWN looks down and sees a smudge on the floor in front of the couch. He goes into a "vision".

SHAWN:
Oh, boy. Oh! (falls to his knees with a gasp, his right hand to his chest) I'm sensing a... I'm sensing there was someone here. Someone here in the room with the victim when he died.

LASSITER rolls his eyes to the ceiling. SHAWN takes LASSITER'S leg and pats his shoe.

SHAWN:
Someone with a sliver of grease on his or her shoe. (LASSITER kicks his leg free and SHAWN falls forward against the table) No, I'm not sensing a struggle. No struggle. (tabs the table) The door. Did you have to break down the door when you got here?

JULIET:
No, it was open. Why?

LASSITER:
No, no. Don't encourage him. Get up! (lifts SHAWN by the arm) McNab! (pushes SHAWN towards BUZZ) I want you to escort these two men out of here now!

SHAWN:
Come on, let me read the witnesses. You know, due diligence.

LASSITER:
Spencer, we did the due diligence. It was a suicide. There is no crime. There are no witnesses.

SHAWN:
You're wrong. There is a witness. (looks at chair where a cat is cleaning itself) There's a cat. I wanna talk to that cat. As soon as he's finished licking himself. Wow, I'm jealous.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are standing outside the building. SHAWN is holding the cat.

GUS:
I can't believe you took that cat.

SHAWN:
Gus, they were gonna ship him off to an animal shelter. What choice did I have? Plus, this cat is the lead witness in a major murder investigation. Wanna hold him?(offers GUS the cat)

GUS:
Oh, no, you don't. I'm not touching that cat. You took the cat, you carry it. (walks away)

SHAWN:
(follows) We are right on this thing now. I didn't have anything substantial. A steak, the chain on the door, a stain on a carpet... I wouldn't have believed me. We needed an in. Now we have one. Plus, he clearly likes you. Give him a snuggle.

GUS:
You know what? I'm actually gonna enjoy this. You having to carry this cat around, pretending you can communicate with it. I'm buying a disposable camera for when you have to clean out its dirty litter box.

SHAWN:
Let me tell you something. This cat here is a gift. A conduit for us to save lives. And he has more integrity in his furry little hand...

GUS:
Paw.

SHAWN:
Paw. ...than most people have in their whole appendages. Appendages.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
All of them. Than most people have in all of their appendages combined.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the office, SHAWN still holding the cat. The cat meows.

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah? I think he wants to sleep on your chair. Isn't it cool?

GUS:
How long are you gonna keep this up for?

SHAWN:
Until we solve the crime.

GUS:
Don't you or your cat get mad at me, but I don't think there was a crime.

SHAWN:
Oh, really? You don't think so?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Try telling that to this poor little guy who is traumatized seeing his owner killed. Tell him.

SHAWN holds the cat up in front of GUS and it hisses.

GUS:
I'm just saying I can kind of get where Lassiter is coming from. A few suicides is not uncommon.

SHAWN:
Gus, did you look at the sky today? Blue, clear. And did you feel it out there? Warm. Nice. Statistically, people in mild climates are far less likely to kill themselves. Now, if we were in Vladivostok, we could talk.

GUS:
Point is, at the end of the day, this was a 50-year-old man living alone with a cat. (sits at his desk)

The cat meows.

SHAWN:
Do you want down? You can get down. (puts down cat and sighs) You're probably right.

GUS:
I know I'm right.

SHAWN:
It was probably a suicide.

GUS:
Thank you. That was big of you to admit.

SHAWN:
I'm just... I'm unclear on one little thing.

GUS:
What's that?

SHAWN:
How do we explain the second body they just found? (brings out scanner)

DISPACTCHER: (on radio)
Deceased is in the car, over.

EXT. GARAGE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS arrive at the crime scene. A body of a woman rests behind the steering wheel.

SHAWN:
Detective O'Hara. What, you're here all by yourself?

JULIET points to LASSITER who has just arrived carrying a cup of coffee and notepad.

SHAWN:
Ah!

LASSITER'S spills the coffee down his front. SHAWN turns to hide a smile.

LASSITER:
Damn it all.

SHAWN:
Could have happened to anybody.

LASSITER ignores SHAWN and GUS and walks to JULIET beside the car.

INT. GARAGE, DAY

LASSITER:
Talk to me.

JULIET:
Well, victim is a female in her late 20s, Gloria Starks. We're waiting for forensics to confirm, but appears to be a suicide. Carbon monoxide poisoning. Asphyxiation.

SHAWN:
Oh, I'm afraid the cat doesn't think so.

LASSITER:
Turn around and walk away.

SHAWN:
This cat can tell us if the killer has been here. All I need is 30 seconds. Watch this. You ready boy? Huh? You ready? What? What, over here? Where? Wait. (cat meows) That is...That is very thoughtful. I'll tell him. (to LASSITER) He says the fact that you take three creams and four sugars in your coffee, dangerous.

JULIET:
Is that true? Do you really take three creams and four sugars?

LASSITER:
So what?

SHAWN:
So what? Carly, that is a heart attack waiting to happen. You're still a young man.

JULIET:
That was amazing. How did you do that?

LASSITER:
It was a lucky guess.

SHAWN:
Don't you get tired of saying that? Now, with your permission, I'd like the little boy cat to sniff out the car.

SHAWN notices writing on the windshield.

LASSITER:
Absolutely not.

SHAWN "accidentally" drops the cat into the back seat.

SHAWN:
Oops!

LASSITER:
What did I just say?

SHAWN:
(puts his hands up and walks to the front of the car) Just relax and let him do his job. He might find something. (looks at the windshield)

LASSITER:
(looks through window) He's peeing.

SHAWN walks back and sees the cat has peed on the dry cleaning on the back seat.

SHAWN:
No. No, he's drawing your attention to the evidence in the back seat.

LASSITER:
By peeing on it. Nice. (reaches through the window) Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

LASSITER picks up the cat by the scruff of the neck and gives it to SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Yes, did you make good pee-pee? Did you make good pee-pee? Yes, you did. What? (cat meows)(SHAWN laughs) What. That's a...That's a little inappropriate. I'm sorry, that's rude. (to LASSITER) He was just saying that he would have done the same thing, if he'd killed himself. He would have swung by the dry cleaners and grabbed the pantsuit first. (walks away)

LASSITER:
Maybe she picked up the dry-cleaning days ago. Did the cat ever think of that?

GUS is watching one of the technicians by the exhaust pipe.

GUS:
What is he doing right here?

JULIET:
He is measuring the amount of carbon monoxide emitted.

GUS:
Uh-huh. Okay. I knew that.

SHAWN:
Yeah, you did.

An officer enters the car from the passenger side and starts the car. Heavy metal blasts from the radio.

SHAWN:
Whoa! Now, does she strike you as the type that would go for heavy metal?

LASSITER:
Any number of people could have changed her radio station. Now, Mr. Spencer, if you and your new partner are finished urinating on things, I believe your work here is done. (turns around and makes notes as he whispers to JULIET) Check out the dry-cleaning.

JULIET:
I'm on it.

INT. ECHO, ON THE ROAD, DAY

SHAWN is behind the wheel and GUS is in the back seat.

SHAWN:
Look, I don't care what Lassiter says. The cat is not my new partner, Gus. Don't be ridiculous.

The camera pulls out and we see the cat in the front passenger seat.

GUS:
Then tell me again why the cat gets to ride shotgun?

SHAWN:
He gets carsick, and you know this. Do you want him to throw up again back there? Is that what you want? (pets the cat)

GUS:
It's not funny, Shawn. Here, lay these down.

GUS hands SHAWN newspaper from the back seat. SHAWN pets the cat as he settles on a pillow.

SHAWN:
He's doing fine, aren't you?

GUS:
This is a company car, Shawn. That means I have to return it in like-new condition. Lay these down.

SHAWN takes the paper and opens it on his lap and sees an article about the dead woman.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa! Look at this!

GUS:
What?

SHAWN hands paper back to GUS.

GUS:
(reads paper) "Seventy percent off of storm doors and window panes. Everything must go."

SHAWN:
Gus, flip it over. It's her.

GUS:
"Struggling actress lands big break in Santa Barbara play."

SHAWN:
And then kills herself? I don't think so.

GUS:
Okay, you might be onto something.

SHAWN:
Yeah.

GUS:
The play is called "Dazzle and Stretch".

SHAWN:
"Dazzle and Stretch"?

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

BUZZ knocks on the filing cabinet by LASSITER'S desk.

BUZZ:
I was wondering if I could ask you a question. (stammers) I could really use some advice.

LASSITER:
Yeah, all right. Get on in here.

BUZZ crosses into LASSITER'S "office".

LASSITER:
What can I do for you, McNab?

BUZZ:
It's just that, well...You're still married, right?

LASSITER:
Are you trying to piss me off?

BUZZ:
I just have a question. On your wedding night did you feel any, well, any added pressure to perform?

LASSITER:
Excuse me?

BUZZ:
It's just that my Francie is going to be expecting a lot on our first night as a married couple, and I was wondering if you had any tips for me.

LASSITER:
(stands) What the hell kind of sick bastard are you?

BUZZ:
Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate it. (nervously backs away and leaves)

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

The cat is on a chair washing himself and SHAWN is sitting in the other chair watching him. VICK is behind her desk.

VICK:
So, what you are trying to tell me is now it's the cat that's convinced these weren't suicides?

SHAWN:
Yes.

VICK:
Do you really think I'm going to open a bunch of closed cases just because a cat tells me to?

SHAWN:
(meows) This is it.

SHAWN gets and moves to the other chair as the cat meows. GUS rolls his eyes from his position standing behind the chair.

SHAWN:
(meows and stands) Yes, this is it. The girl that was found in her car, Gloria Starks, she's here. She's here with us.

SHAWN inhales deeply and pretends to be channeling a female dancer, strutting through VICK'S office.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

From his desk, LASSITER can see SHAWN.

SHAWN:
(feminine voice) Oh, despair! (puts hand to his head as if about to faint)

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN:
(feminine voice) I fear that you will leave me. What choice do I have? (breaks into song and dance) I dazzle and I stretch. I dazzle and I stretch.

LASSITER enters the office.

LASSITER:
What the hell is going on here?

VICK:
(shushes LASSITER) Mr. Spencer, this is telling me nothing.

As SHAWN continues his "dance", LASSITER takes the seat SHAWN vacated.

GUS:
He can't hear you right now 'cause, see, he's channeling the cat who's channeling Gloria.

SHAWN:
(singing) I dazzle

VICK:
Well, then what are we looking at?

SHAWN:
(singing) I stretch. (takes newspaper from under GUS' arm)

LASSITER:
Bad acting.

SHAWN twirls until he is standing behind LASSITER.

GUS:
I think she wants you to see something in the paper. Gloria's trying to tell you something.

SHAWN lowers the paper in front of LASSITER.

SHAWN:
(singing) Dazzle and stretch.

LASSITER:
(reads newspaper) "Seventy percent off on storm doors and window panes. Everything must go." (SHAWN flips paper over) "Struggling actress lands big break in Santa Barbara play." So what. (tosses paper aside)

GUS:
So what? Does that sound like a woman who would kill herself?

LASSITER:
Please, all actresses are crazies. I know, I dated one in college once. She had a nose ring.

SHAWN is done with his stretching exercises and groans.

SHAWN:
Good work, little buddy. (collapses into LASSITER'S lap)

LASSITER:
Whoa!

VICK:
I don't know. This is something.

SHAWN:
Something? Oh, come on, you guys. That's the biggest thing that ever happened for that girl. Now you need to stop waiting around for another suicide and start looking for a serial killer.

LASSITER:
Spencer, get off my lap.

SHAWN stands.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is writing on a mounted clear Plexiglass board. Also attached are photos of the crimes scenes and notes from the files.

GUS:
What does this mean?

SHAWN:
I have no idea, but I've seen it on Numb3rs all the time and it seems to work for them.

GUS:
You ready to give up?

SHAWN:
Four separate suicides, two of which occurred before we came on the case, and I don't see a pattern of any kind. Different ages, different sexes.

GUS:
Different socio-economic levels.

SHAWN:
Different methods of death. No duplicate weapons, locations. Man, what have we got? First we have a jumper, second, an oven, third, pills, fourth, carbon monoxide. They all have to be connected somehow. And what I see is whole lot of nothing.

GUS:
(scoffs) Nothing.

SHAWN flashes back to advice from HENRY.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1985

EXT. SPENCER HOUSE, DAY

HENRY:
You see, sometimes, Shawn, you don't have to dig so deep. All you gotta do is turn something upside down to make it right side up. And then... (takes out

ring) you get your prize.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SHAWN:
Wait a minute. (rearranges photos of the victims)

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
Turning things upside down in order to make them right side up. (steps back) And there's the prize.

EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX, DAY

SHAWN strides along the walk to the building entrance. GUS follows.

GUS:
This is the prize? Going to the first dead guy's place and what? Talk to a dead guy?

SHAWN:
No, we talk to the dead guy's brother.

GUS:
The dead guy's brother lives at the dead guy's place?

SHAWN:
(presses buzzer at door) They were roommates. But that's the point. He's getting rid of the apartment.

The signal buzzes telling them the door is open.

SHAWN:
And we're here to rent it. (goes inside)

GUS:
We're what?

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALL DAY

SHAWN knocks on the apartment door.

GUS:
Why can't we for once just talk to somebody as us?

SHAWN:
Because, Gus, I don't want him to be on guard. If he thinks we're investigating something, he'll clam up.

A man opens the door.

SHAWN:
Wes Hiltonbock?

WES:
Yeah?

SHAWN:
Hey, Shawn Spencer. I talked to you on the phone about the apartment, and this is Gus. It would actually be for both of us.

WES:
Yeah, okay, come on.

SHAWN:
Thanks, man.

INT. APARTMENT, DAY

They enter and look around the living room.

WES:
Just so you guys know, the utilities are included, but I would require first and last month and a sizable security deposit.

SHAWN:
Oh, that's not a problem. You take cats?

WES:
Yeah, I guess so. You two guys have a cat?

SHAWN:
We do, actually. He's sort of like our child.

WES:
I see. How do you guys know each other?

GUS:
We're partners.

WES:
Got you.

GUS:
Oh, no, no, no.

WES:
No, it's fine. Really, I'm totally fine.

GUS:
No, we're partners in a private...

SHAWN:
Relationship. (stands closer to GUS) Believe it, it's been a while. We finish each other's sentences. (starts exploring the bathroom) So, tell me, Wes, why would you want to give up such a handsome apartment? Do you...Do you not like it anymore? (takes a piece of mail and hides it under his clothes before returning to living room) Ooh, Gus, good news, shower for two.

WES:
Actually I just have some bad memories here. I used to... I used to live here with my brother, but he passed away.

SHAWN:
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Was he sick, or...

WES:
He killed himself.

SHAWN:
Oh, good Lord. I'm so sorry.

GUS:
Yeah, I'm sorry.

WES:
Yeah, me, too. We were real close, you know.

SHAWN:
God, was he depressed? I mean, were there signs? Did you... What am I... I'm sorry, you don't have to answer those questions.

WES:
No. Actually, I had no idea anything was wrong, you know. I mean, he had so much to live for. He was a great guy, you know. Smarter than me, more talented. He was a great singer. He was really going places. So look, are you guys...You guys interested in the place or...

SHAWN:
What do you think, honey?

GUS waggles his hand.

SHAWN:
I think it's great. I think it's perfect.

WES:
All right, then. Well, I got another couple coming by a little later so... But I'll let you guys know either way.

INT. ECHO, ON THE ROAD, DAY

GUS:
Shower for two?

SHAWN:
That was so I could see your face when I said it.

GUS:
You know, you enjoy these things more than you should. I suffered through that for no reason. We learned nothing.

SHAWN:
(pulls the envelope from his pocket) Yes, but I grabbed this while we were up there.

GUS:
You took his mail?

SHAWN:
It's not like I took his Sports Illustrated. Dude, it's a phone bill.

GUS:
You can't open someone else's mail, Shawn. It's a federal offense.

SHAWN:
Gus, he's dead.

GUS:
So what?

SHAWN:
Well, maybe I'll hold it to my head and read it psychically.

GUS:
Hurry up, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Gus, who's gonna see us?

GUS:
Hurry up.

SHAWN:
(opens envelope) Wait, there's like... There's like 16 calls here to some 1-800 stress line. Including the last call he made.

GUS:
I've seen the ads for that. So what? A depressed guy calls a stress line. And I bet you a hungry guy calls a pizza place. That doesn't tell us anything.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but it might give us a link. I'm gonna run the other victims' phone records.

GUS:
With what? Your do-it-yourself phone record running kit?

SHAWN:
The next best thing.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN has a "vision" for JULIET.

SHAWN:
The answer is in the phone bills. I need you to run the victims' phone records.

JULIET:
What, no cat this time?

SHAWN:
Juliet, I'm very serious about this. I have a strong sense about a stress line and I know the link is in the phone records.

JULIET:
I don't know why you would think I would do something like this for you.

SHAWN:
Some have said it's the hair.

LASSITER walks up behind SHAWN and GUS.

LASSITER:
Really? Who says that? Oh, guess what? We already ran the phone records and checked out the dry-cleaning. Turns out the pantsuits were picked up over a week ago. What kind of dog and pony show do you think we run here?

SHAWN:
Gus, you wanna take this one?

GUS:
No.

LASSITER:
Let me put an end to this non-case right now, okay? Yes, all the victims called the 1-800 stress line. Not just once, many times over.

JULIET:
Detective Lassiter and I have combed everything. We've gone to the bone on these.

SHAWN:
All the way to the bone?

JULIET:
I know this is hard for you to grasp, but these people did have something in common. They were troubled and they were depressed, and as sad as that is, they all committed suicide. Case closed.

SHAWN:
We've clearly wasted your time.

SHAWN and GUS turn and walk away.

GUS:
It's not over, is it?

SHAWN:
Of course not. They all called the same help line and they all killed themselves? Come on!

GUS:
Shawn, that's what stressed people do.

LASSITER and JULIET watch them leave.

JULIET:
Strange how he gave up so easily.

LASSITER:
Yeah, it is. Maybe we should take a closer look at that stress line.

The detectives head back to the bullpen.

SHAWN:
Gloria Starks only called that line 'cause she was stressed about an audition. You call a help line and they find you dead? That's not very helpful. What if someone there is killing the callers and making it look like suicide? Gus, we go to the stress line, I think we solve the case. Come on.

INT. BUILDING, HALL, DAY

SHAWN motions to a sign on a door that reads "DIAL-A-PSYCHIC".

SHAWN:
Ta-da!

GUS:
What is this?

SHAWN:
You're looking at our new business. Mazel tov.

GUS:
Are you out of your mind? You rented office space for this?

SHAWN:
Gus, don't be a crazy hooligan. I rented a sign.

SHAWN opens the door to reveal a janitor's closet lined with shelves of cleaning equipment. Resting on a "Wet Floor" sign is a pineapple  with a red bow. SHAWN picks it up.

SHAWN:
Now, let's go say hello to our new neighbors. (leaves)

GUS closes the door and follows.

INT. HELP LINE OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk into the busy office with everyone in their cubicles.

SHAWN:
Hello, everyone! (holds up pineapple) Who wants pineapple? Be honest. Ah, you guys can slice it up, fight over it later.

A MAN comes out of the office behind them.

MAN:
I'm sorry, gentlemen, may I help you? I'm Terrance, I run the line here. (shakes their hands)

SHAWN:
Terrance, hello. I'm Shawn Spencer, this is my partner Gus "Silly Pants" Jackson. Just came by to say hello. We've opened up our own little 1-800 thingy down the hall. Not as big as you guys. More of a closet, really.

TERRANCE:
Your own 1-800 thingy, huh?

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's called Dial-A-Psychic. Maybe you recognize us. I am the lead psychic for the Santa Barbara police department. McCallum murders. Edmond robberies? Over there, you? Nothing? Nothing? Wow, really. What, do you guys live in this room?

They all laugh. One of the men at the cubicles is younger with spiked hair, eyeliner, black nail polish and a pierced ear.

MAN:
So, you can know stuff about me just by looking at me?

SHAWN:
Yeah, pretty much.

MAN 2:
Do it.

SHAWN:
Do it?

MAN:
Go ahead, show us.

SHAWN:
Looking for a little demo.

GUS:
Well, for one, they don't like pineapple.

They all laugh.

SHAWN:
I don't know guys. I don't think Big T wants us to take up any more...

TERRANCE:
Oh, no, no, no. Go right ahead. Half the lines are down, phones are being worked on right now. We have time for your little trick.

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah? (shoves the pineapple at TERRANCE'S stomach before walking closer to the cubicles) Let's see what I can come up with.

SHAWN looks out the window and sees the man from the phone company working on the pole. He then zooms in on the first man, noticing his eyeliner and rhyming dictionary.

SHAWN:
Loose flowing stanzas, Bobby Frost. Are you a poet, by chance?

MAN:
Yeah! Yeah, I am!

The workers in the office gasp in astonishment.

MAN:
Wow. How did you know that?

SHAWN:
I guess you could say I'm a bit of a psychic poet. (everyone claps) Oh, please, stop.

MAN:
'Cause I'm like, I'm freaking out here!

GUS:
Do you see his eyeliner?

SHAWN:
Guy could be the drummer from The Cure.

EXT. BEACH, DAY

LASSITER is sitting on a bench by the water eating a sandwich. JULIET finds him. She is carrying file folders.

JULIET:
Wow, I can see why you come out here to eat. It's beautiful. (sits next to him)  Sound of the seagulls, the smell of the ocean, the salt air...

LASSITER:
Hmm. I never noticed. What do you got there?

JULIET:
(hands him files) What you asked for. I ran the sheets on all the volunteers at the stress line.

LASSITER turns to the man sitting on his other side.

LASSITER:
Do you mind? It's police business. (holds up badge) Scram. (man leaves) Let's see what we got here. (reads file)  Well, lookie there. It's a picture of an old friend.

JULIET:
Hmm.

INT. HALL, DAY

SHAWN comes out of the elevator and passes the phone man as he enters. He sees the Goth squatting on the floor listening to his MP3 player and jotting notes.

SHAWN:
Hey, Rory.

RORY doesn't hear him and SHAWN continues down the hall.

INT. CLOSET, DAY

GUS is sitting on an over-turned mop bucket when SHAWN enters and throws a soda can at him.

GUS:
Where the hell have you been? I've been sitting on this mop bucket in this tiny closet for the last hour and a half waiting for you to show up. I'm all cramped.

SHAWN:
Well, get up, man. Do some pushups or something. I need you light and limber.

GUS:
Do some pushups?

SHAWN:
Sure, like Clint Eastwood in Escape from Alcatraz. Sure, he spends the whole movie in a tiny little cell, right? But he's in the best shape of his entire life. Give me a little piece of tape.

GUS:
(hands SHAWN tape) What happened to the big ticking time clock?

SHAWN:
(holds up a poster with one hand as he reaches for the tape) Gus, what do you think I've been doing all day? (looks at telephone schedule) My work happens here (points to head) and here. (hand over heart)

GUS:
(stands) What are you doing?

SHAWN:
I am trying to create a pleasant work environment. (finishes taping poster) I can tell by looking at your little area that you don't care.

GUS:
We don't work here, Shawn.

SHAWN:
We do until we solve these murders. But don't worry, I have a plan. You are gonna call the stress line and pretend to be depressed.

GUS:
No, I'm not. (sits back down)

SHAWN:
Yes. And I will go down the hall when you make the call, ask for Rory, so that I can see him in action.

GUS:
Why don't you call him?

SHAWN:
Gus, please be serious for one second. No one's gonna believe that I'm depressed. Come on.

GUS:
I got an idea. Why don't you have the cat make the call? He's like your new partner, right? Where is he, anyway?

SHAWN:
Gus, he's far more comfortable in your car. Plus, I need him well rested for when he identifies the killer. Now, wait exactly two seconds and then make the call.

GUS:
Oh! I have no idea what I'd even say.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Here's a good opener. "Hello, my name's Gus. I have a deep-seated jealousy for a tiny little boy cat." (leaves)

INT. HELP LINE OFFICE, DAY

TERRANCE is talking with one of his workers.

TERRANCE:
Why would you put them on speakerphone? See, because I think that tends to undercut...

SHAWN walks in carrying a coconut with a bow and straw.

SHAWN:
Big T! Look sharp! (hands TERRANCE the coconut)

TERRANCE:
(sighs) What is it now, Mr. Spencer?

SHAWN:
Just wanted to pick your brain for a second. How many lines you got going here?

TERRANCE:
I have 12 lines, but I'm adding more all the time.

SHAWN:
I get it, I get it, the more lines, the more green, am I right?

TERRANCE:
I'm a non-profit operation. The calls are free. I'm not in this for the money.

SHAWN:
Really, that's weird. See, I'm thinking of charging four bucks a minute.

TERRANCE gives SHAWN the coconut back and goes back into his office. SHAWN looks around and sees RORY at his cubicle, listening to his music and writing.

SHAWN:
(softly) Rory. (walks over) Rory! (taps on cubicle) Hey, Ror.

RORY:
(looks up and removes earbuds) Hey.

SHAWN:
You really do love your music, huh?

RORY:
You kidding? Music inspires me.

SHAWN:
Yeah, you know, you don't really strike me as the...

RORY:
Charitable type?

SHAWN:
I was gonna say sensitive, but sure.

RORY:
Actually, I'm here as part of a community service on this assault beef, you know. I got into it with this guy who didn't like my poetry. So, 250 hours.

A phone rings.

SHAWN:
Two-fifty, wow, that's intense.

TERRANCE calls from his office door.

TERRANCE:
Rory, that's Line 6!

SHAWN:
I'll let you get back to work.

RORY:
Sorry. (picks up phone) Hello, Stressline, the extra S is for extra stress. This is Rory.

SHAWN sits in a chair in front of the cubicle, a file in one hand, the coconut in the other.

RORY:
Uh-huh. Right, so you're experiencing some stress. Career and personal?

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. CLOSET, DAY

GUS is sitting the bucket talking into his cellphone.

GUS:
Well, yeah, I suppose. I mean my career's not exactly where I would like it to be. No. No, I don't have a girlfriend right now. It's been awhile.

RORY:
Right. Right, that's not good. Does it make you have dark thoughts?

SHAWN looks at him.

GUS:
Like how dark are you talking? Like, "wanna be dead" dark?

RORY:
Okay, easy, I just wanna say this, like, right off the bat, suicide is not the answer.

GUS:
(stands) Who said anything about suicide? I just said maybe I should find a new hobby, like coin collecting. Or something at the beach. I like water activities.

RORY:
Like drowning?

GUS:
What? Drowning? I don't want to drown!

RORY:
No, no, of course you don't. That's awful, okay? But I don't care what you say about suicide in a lake being poetic, you know, like, your body floating to the top of the pristine, serene waters and your final breaths rippling out in an ever-widening circle, you know, like the circle of life.

SHAWN looks around in disbelief, surprised that no one is upset at what RORY is saying. He is certainly uncomfortable.

RORY:
But you have to stop that kind of thinking. You have so much to live for.

GUS:
You're damn straight, I have a lot to live for!

RORY:
Of course you do. You see, I can tell, this phone call is helping you already.

SHAWN mouths "I'm gonna go" and RORY waves goodbye.

INT. CLOSET, DAY

SHAWN enters and closes the door behind him.

SHAWN:
Dude, what the hell was that?

GUS:
Was he trying to help me? Cause I feel really creeped out right now.

SHAWN:
Dude, he put you on the creepy train headed for Creep Island where the natives drink creep nectar out of creepy coconut shells...

GUS:
Shawn, it's horrible.

SHAWN:
Yeah, I'm sorry.

GUS:
He's nuts, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Yes.

GUS:
And worst of all, he actually made some good points! I mean, pharmaceutical sales, not sexy. You are my only non-work friend. There's got to be something wrong with that.

SHAWN:
Hey, hey, hey, what is this?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(points to poster of dangling kitten) Hang in there.

GUS:
He's right, I need to start taking some more risks.

SHAWN:
Does that mean we can go cliff diving in Zihuatanejo?

GUS:
No. I'm being serious, Shawn!

SHAWN:
Look, would it make you feel any better if I told you Hiltonbock called? We got the apartment!

GUS:
What would make me feel better is if we called the police! This guy is dangerous, Shawn. Let's call Vick. Maybe get him arrested.

GUS grabs his jacket and starts for the door but SHAWN stops him.

SHAWN:
Gus, Gus!

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
The only thing this guy is guilty of right now is being a bad poet. You know how this game works. We cannot just pick up a phone and beg the police to come and save us.

GUS mutters angrily.

SHAWN:
Look, just... Just stay away from the water for now. Final decision, we wait.

SHAWN hears the elevator ding and looks at his watch. We then hear a woman speaking indistinctly. SHAWN opens the door and sees VICK, LASSITER and JULES with officers as they exit the elevator. They don't know which way to go.

JULIET:
No, it's this way.

VICK:
You sure?

JULIET:
Yes.

The police go down the hall and SHAWN looks at GUS.

SHAWN:
Now, was that so hard?

They exit the closet.

INT. HELP LINE OFFICE, NIGHT

LASSITER holds up RORY'S eyeliner with a handkerchief.

LASSITER:
Maybe you'd care to explain this.

RORY:
My eyeliner pencil?

LASSITER:
So, you admit it's yours. (turns around to look at SHAWN) Funny how Gloria Starks' suicide note was scrawled across her windshield in black eyeliner. Yet no eyeliner was found at the crime scene. You, my friend, are looking at exhibit A. (reaches out his hand without looking) Bag it, O'Hara.

JULIET opens the evidence bag and LASSITER drops in the eyeliner pen.

LASSITER:
(folds handkerchief) You like your music, don't you, Rory?

RORY:
Yeah, I do. It's my inspiration.

LASSITER:
I bet. I bet it inspires you to kill. That's why you couldn't resist playing your big-haired, drug-induced death music on Mortimer Tilden's stereo while you forced him to swallow all those pills. Or on Gloria Starks' car radio while she slipped into unconsciousness. And even now. Let's have a little listen, shall we?

LASSITER yanks out the headphone plug and we hear "Up, Up and Away" by the Fifth Dimension. RORY pulls the cord out of LASSITER'S grip. JULIET and VICK look at LASSITER.

LASSITER:
What, you think you can pull a fast one on me switching out your head-thrashing crap for this noise? (tosses the speakers back onto the desk)

RORY:
This crap is all I listen to. I hate metal music. I use the details that I get from callers to write better poems. I am not a killer!

LASSITER:
Yeah, I know, you're a poet, but you're also an assaulter, aren't you? Who do you think arrested you on that assault charge?

SHAWN looks out the window and sees the phone man working on the lines on the pole outside. It sparks a number of flashes. He remembers seeing the guy from the phone company in the hall and when BUZZ told him that "A guy from the phone company found the victim", and then the maintenance schedule for the phone lines. He looks up at the telephone pole and the man is gone.

RORY:
I didn't kill anybody.

LASSITER:
Get him out of my sight.

The officers take RORY away. As LASSITER walks out, he looks at SHAWN.

LASSITER:
What? You're not taking notes?

SHAWN motions with his arms in an "I don't know" gesture.

GUS:
How could you let him do that? Now Lassiter gets credit for solving the crime and we won't get paid.

SHAWN:
Oh, we're gonna get paid.

GUS:
How do you figure?

SHAWN:
Lassiter didn't solve the crime. Rory is innocent. He didn't do it.

GUS:
He didn't?

SHAWN:
No.

GUS:
Then who did?

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING, NIGHT

The cat lies on the grass as SHAWN pushes GUS up the telephone pole.

SHAWN:
Just grip the spike with your little foot and climb! Come on!

GUS grunts as he reaches the first rungs.

GUS:
Why do I gotta go first? (climbs)

SHAWN:
'Cause you're a climbing machine, Gus. Just, you know, be careful. Grip the spike with your foot! Okay, oh, okay, okay. (sees a mark on the sole of GUS' shoe that matches the one he saw on the floor at the crime scene) Grease. (remembers seeing the metal rungs as key hooks at Hiltonbock's apartment)

Dude, dude! Dude, I know who the killer is!

GUS:
Can I come down then?

SHAWN:
No, no, stay up there. I have to figure out where he's headed.

GUS:
Who is it?

SHAWN:
Well, put it this way, I don't think taking the apartment is such a good idea, unless you think it's cool that our would-be landlord is a serial killer.

GUS:
Hiltonbock?

SHAWN:
There was a pattern. See, all the murders coincide with dates that Hiltonbock was servicing the phone lines. That's when he had access.

GUS:
(grabs phone off hook) With this?

SHAWN:
Yes. Yeah, yeah, send that down.

GUS drops the phone down to SHAWN on its long wire.

SHAWN:
Perfect!(picks it up) See, this device stores all the incoming and outgoing calls. My guess is that wherever number he dialed last, that's where Hiltonbock is headed. And whoever that is, is probably his next victim. (dials)

BUZZ: (over phone)
Hello, you've reached Buzz McNab. I'm not in right now, but please do leave a message and I will get back to you when I get in.

SHAWN:
Oh, no. (dials)

GUS:
Who are you calling?

SHAWN: (into phone)
Hello, Chief? Hey, Shawn Spencer here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, I'm getting a vibe right now as big as a Buick!

EXT. STREET, NIGHT

The Echo hurtles around the corner and pulls up outside BUZZ'S apartment building. SHAWN and GUS get out of the car.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, you don't. Stay, boy cat!

They race up to the building and check the mailboxes to find which one belongs to BUZZ before running inside.

INT. HALL, NIGHT

They come up to BUZZ'S apartment door. SHAWN tests the handle and learns that it's unlock. With a quick fist bump, they dash into the apartment.

INT. BUZZ'S APARTMENT, NIGHT

WES turns on them, a gun in his hand with a noose wrapped about his arm. BUZZ is in his underwear standing on a chair. SHAWN and GUS hold their hands up.

SHAWN:
Hey, McNab, so this is the place, huh? It's nice. It's really nice.

LASSITER runs in, his gun aimed at WES.

LASSITER:
Drop it!

WES:
Don't come any closer.

LASSITER:
Put it down or I will drop you!

WES:
I swear to God I'm gonna shoot him.

VICK, JULIET and other officers have entered the apartment, all with guns drawn and aimed at WES.

LASSITER:
Drop it!

SHAWN:
Everybody breathe, just breathe!

LASSITER:
(to SHAWN) Get out of here.

SHAWN:
Well, the other ones must have gone a lot smoother than this, huh, Hiltonbock?

The cat enters the apartment without anyone noticing.

SHAWN:
Though, comparatively, it was probably pretty easy to get Mortimer Tilden to swallow those pills.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FLASHBACK

INT. VICTIM'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM, DAY

TILDEN is holding the bottle of pills in his hand as he sits on the couch. WES is kneeling on the floor in front of him, gun aimed at TILDEN.

WES:
You wanna die, old man, huh? Eat them!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SHAWN:
Because you are not really a cold-blooded serial killer. Are you?

LASSITER:
No, but he threw his own brother off a building!

WES:
I didn't push him off the roof.

SHAWN:
No, no, no. No, you didn't. You didn't do that.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FLASHBACK

EXT. WES' APARTMENT, BALCONY, DAY

WES is standing on the balcony looking down.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
But you were there. You saw it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SHAWN:
You saw the whole thing. You saw him jump off the balcony of the apartment that you shared.

WES:
He was weak.

SHAWN:
There's a lot of weak people out there, Hiltonbock. Are you gonna track them all down, huh, one at a time? Punish them for their weakness? You wanna get back at your brother so badly, you don't even care who these people were, just that they called the line. And look, you're gonna kill McNab here just because he had a few pre-wedding jitters.

BUZZ:
(stammers) I was just looking for a little advice. (looks at LASSITER) Nobody else would talk to me.

Everyone else looks at LASSITER and he acts a little embarrassed.

SHAWN:
It's okay, Buzz. We all have stress. All of us. Right here in this room. I mean, take a good look, Hiltonbock. We all have problems. Who else deserves to get shot or hung? Maybe it's Gus.

LASSITER:
That's enough, Spencer.

SHAWN:
No. Shoot him.

GUS:
What are you doing?

WES:
(turns his gun on GUS) Yeah, maybe I should.

GUS:
Don't listen to him. He's a crazy person, he's crazy. (hides behind SHAWN)

SHAWN:
That's right, I am crazy. So maybe you should shoot me.

WES:
Okay.

GUS moves away from SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Here's the best part. It doesn't matter what I think, because you have a problem that's a lot bigger than me. (points to LASSITER) This guy. The man with his gun trained on you is not only a fine human being, with a strong Irish hairline, he is an exemplary public servant and arguably the finest detective mind in the lower western Santa Barbara County area over the age of 35. And right now, while I'm speaking, he is devising a swift and stealth-like tactic that is going to disarm you and blow your freaking mind!

While SHAWN has been talking, WES nervously aims his gun at everyone.

SHAWN:
(whispers to LASSITER) Anytime you're ready. All right, we gotta make the move.

At that moment the cat jumps from the top of the CD shelf with a meow and onto WES who screams as the claws dig into his skin. Taking advantage of the situation, LASSITER tackles WES to the floor. The cat runs away. BUZZ bends over to pick up the gun.

LASSITER:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Using the tips of his fingers, BUZZ passes the gun to JULIET. LASSITER looks up at SHAWN.

LASSITER:
That was adequate, Spencer.

SHAWN:
Don't thank me. Thank the little boy cat.

LASSITER lifts a handcuffed WES to his feet and marches him out the door.

SHAWN:
(spots the cat) There you are. There's my big guy. (picks up cat) There's my big guy. (pets him) You are a hero. You are a hero today. Yes. Speaking of heroes, McNab, I was gonna get you something off the registry online, but it turns out the Chief already got you the asparagus steamer.

(BUZZ grins) So, instead I give you this little guy. (hands BUZZ the cat) Yeah. (backs away slowly) If you take him in the car, he likes to ride upfront, shotgun.

BUZZ scratches the cat's head and he purrs.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are sitting at the table eating breakfast cereal, the same one SHAWN was eating as a child.

GUS:
You know, there's something beautiful about the color Fruity Puffs turns the milk.

SHAWN:
(mouthful) I think it's the most beautiful thing in the whole world.

GUS:
You know, I've been thinking. You're not the only one who lives a charmed life, Shawn. I got it pretty good, too.

SHAWN:
Yes, you do, and it makes me glad to hear you say so.

GUS:
I mean, the other day at work, this dermatologist, Katie Finestatt, commented how I looked handsome carrying my sample case into her office.

SHAWN:
(mouthful) Finestatt said that?

GUS:
Yes, she did. And she is fine. (takes a spoonful) So, it got me thinking, maybe pharmaceutical sales can be sort of sexy.

SHAWN:
There are times when I have to stand a few feet away because you're literally sizzling.

GUS:
You see what I'm saying? I mean, you may be my only non-work friend, but you're my best friend. And how many best friends does one guy need, really?

SHAWN holds up his index finger.

GUS:
That's my point.

SHAWN:
It's all in the attitude, Gus.

GUS:
Exactly. Not sweating the small stuff.

SHAWN:
Life is too short.

GUS:
Too short. (picks up the cereal box) Changing my attitude, Shawn. (pours the cereal into his bowl but looks into the box when nothing else comes out) Where the hell is my prize? Where's my ring, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Easy now.

GUS:
No, no, I've timed the bowls out perfectly, Shawn. Me, then you, then me, then you, then I get the prize!

SHAWN:
What happened to "Not sweating the small stuff? "Life's too short," all that?

GUS opens the bottom of the box and realizes what happened.

GUS:
Did you open the bottom of the box?

SHAWN lifts up the hand he had hidden under the table. On his pinkie is a ring.

SHAWN:
Now, why would I do something like that?

GUS:
That's my ring.

SHAWN looks at the ring.

GUS:
You know I would kill for that ring, don't you?

SHAWN:
Oh, you're upsetting me. You just changed my mood from an orangey yellow to a muddy brown. You need to say something sweet. Quick.

GUS stands and wiggles his finger in the remains of SHAWN'S cereal and milk before stalking away.

SHAWN:
Gus! That's so childish. (SHAWN pushes his bowl aside and picks up GUS') I'm gonna eat yours!

The door slams in the distance as SHAWN eats the cereal.

Episode 1x06 Weekend Warriors

1986

EXT. FIELD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are in scout uniforms sitting on a picnic table eating peanuts. HENRY is wearing jeans and a police department t-shirt and he lectures the boys on the lesson.

HENRY:
"For every action, there is an opposite and equal reaction." Who? (kneels)

GUS:
Isaac Newton, third law of motion.

HENRY is putting together a rocket.

HENRY:
And how does that apply to the nature of man? Anyone? Shawn.

SHAWN:
You push, they push back.

HENRY:
Correct. Why?

SHAWN:
Because man is a stupid creature who'd rather fight than use his brain.

HENRY:
And what idiot said that?

BOTH:
You did.

HENRY:
(stands) The name of the game is survival, sports fans. In order to survive, you've got to fight. (stuffs the parachute into the rocket) And if you fight, you better damn well win. Because if you don't win, and you don't use your brain, then what happens? Gus?

GUS:
You lose?

HENRY:
And for this troop, that is not an option.Comprende?

BOTH:
Sir, yes, sir!

HENRY:
Because losing is for lowlifes. Losing is for quitters. (bends over so he's level with their faces) Are you boys lowlifes? Are you boys quitters?

BOTH:
Sir, no, sir!

HENRY:
Troop 101, ten-hut!

HENRY stands up straight as SHAWN and GUS jump off the table.

HENRY:
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the Junior Bobcat Manual's infamous Exercise Number 32, the launching of a solid fuel rocket. Now, one of you lucky grunts is gonna nab this thing and you're gonna haul ass back to me. (kneels and attaches rocket to firing stand) The prize? A hot fudge sundae. But if you lose? What does the loser get, Shawn?

SHAWN:
He gets to look on with envy.

HENRY:
That is correct. He gets to look on with envy. (stands) Because that, gentlemen, is the American way. On your marks. (the boys take up position as HENRY checks his pocket watch) Ready. Set. (fires rocket) Go!

SHAWN and GUS run towards the woods and over the fence.

EXT. WOODS, DAY

SHAWN looks around for the rocket just as GUS jumps down onto the path with something yellow in his hands. GUS runs away.

EXT. FIELD, DAY

GUS runs up to HENRY who is sitting on the table eating peanuts. SHAWN follows.

HENRY:
(sees what GUS has) What's this? (takes parachute)

GUS:
A parachute.

HENRY:
I sent you after a rocket. Shawn? Where's my rocket?

SHAWN:
I thought he had it.

HENRY reaches around behind his back and shows them the rocket. SHAWN sees another path and mud on HENRY'S shoes.

SHAWN:
A shortcut! You took a shortcut!

HENRY:
A shortcut, huh? Prove it. (stands and sets up the rocket again) I'll tell you what, I beat you this time, I'm eating the sundae. (fires rocket)

PRESENT DAY

EXT. FIELD, DAY

We see a rocket fall from the sky near a camp of tents by a small creek bed. SHAWN and GUS walk down a dirt road to a spot overlooking the field. SHAWN has a blanket over his arm and GUS is carrying a bag of take-out. They each have a jar of Snapple.

SHAWN:
Ooh, just in time.

GUS:
For what?

SHAWN:
The annual Civil War re-enactors meltdown.

GUS:
The event isn't until next weekend.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but this is the best part, the rehearsal. This is what they should charge for.

Down on the field, LASSITER is on horseback in full costume, including a period beard and mustache of a Union officer.

LASSITER:
Form battle lines! Prepare muskets!

GUS:
Is that Lassiter?

SHAWN:
Yes, it is.

GUS:
What died on his face?

LASSITER:
Charge!

The re-enactors charge forward, meeting on the bridge. GUS and SHAWN are now sitting on the blanket eating their sandwiches. During the mock battle, LASSITER sees something wrong and halts it.

LASSITER:
Stop, stop, stop! Stop! (blows a bugle for their attention) Okay, guys, that was better. (stammers) Really. It was good, actually. Okay, it wasn't good. (dismounts) Look, guys, I know I promised last week that I wasn't going to give any more notes. But, guys, come on, that last charge, it was... How do I say this? It was a soul-sucking embarrassment that made me ashamed to wear the uniform. Luke Bauer? Where's Luke?

A man in Union uniform steps forward. He has a bayonet through his eye.

BAUER:
(salutes) Colonel Lassiter, sir!

LASSITER:
Luke, what did I say about the bayonet gag, huh? Too much. There's gonna be kids watching this, all right? We don't want the people in the grandstands to vomit. Okay, I know we haven't reenacted this one for a while. But the battle at Piper's Cove, Kentucky, 1864, is special to me. It ended Confederate Quantrill's plot to assassinate Lincoln. And it involved my great-great-grandfather, Colonel Muscum T. Lassiter...

GUS:
Muscum?

SHAWN:
What the hell is a Muscum?

GUS:
It was a very common name of the era. (SHAWN looks at him) History Channel.

SHAWN:
ESPN, Gus. Channel 206. I'm begging you. (looks up and sees JULIET) Hey, Jules! Wanna join?

JULIET:
Oh, can I?

SHAWN:
I don't know. Do you have your own hoopskirt?

JULIET:
I rent one.

LASSITER:
Sally Reynolds, front and center.

A woman dressed as a Civil War nurse steps forward.

LASSITER:
You missed your cue, Sally. The cannon fired, yet no Sally.

SALLY:
I got stuck in the hospital tent. Sergeant Menish had a quick question about his homeowner's policy.

LASSITER:
How touching. However, today you are not here to sell insurance, Sally. Today you are here to help me win the Civil War. And according to our battle plan, when the fifth cannon fires you exit the hospital tent and you shoot Captain Quantrill off his horse.

SALLY:
There's no need to get nasty.

SHAWN:
I agree. It was totally out of line. (they look at SHAWN) Sorry, I didn't think you could hear that!

LASSITER:
Sally, sweet Sally. (puts a hand on her shoulder and walks with her) If you do not point your gun at Captain Quantrill and fire at the prescribed moment, the audience will not be able to make heads nor tails of what we are doing.(jumps into the dry creek bed walks over to body)  And it will appear as if the evil Captain Quantrill, now being portrayed by our horrifyingly method-acting Nelson Poe who happened to roll way off his mark, by the way, fell off his horse and is lying here for no apparent reason at all. Get up, Nelson. Nelson, I swear to God, if you're sleeping through rehearsal again... I said get up!

JULIET senses something is wrong and runs down to the bridge. SHAWN and GUS stand up. LASSITER kneels beside the body and checks for a pulse.

SHAWN:
Okay, either that guy is a phenomenal actor or he's dead.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN is trying to plead his case with LASSITER. LASSITER has changed into a suit but still had the facial hair.

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, let me in on this.

LASSITER:
No.

SHAWN:
I was there. Inexplicably drawn to the scene. I was meant to solve this case. It's sort of like a miracle.

LASSITER:
You have been out there every weekend we've rehearsed. And don't think I didn't see you trying to throw M&Ms in the injured soldiers' mouths.

SHAWN:
Okay, first of all, those were Skittles, and they have a rainbow of flavors.

LASSITER:
The answer is still no. Beat it. (leaves)

The Evidence Room door opens and SHAWN can see inside where JULIET is examining the bullet hole in the coat Poe had been wearing. The door closes and, as LASSITER walks past, SHAWN goes into a "vision".

SHAWN:
Oh! Hold it! I'm suddenly seeing Nelson. The bullet, traveling through the air, tearing, ripping, pain... The bullet went straight through his heart. This was not an accident, Detective!

LASSITER:
I don't know how you know that, and I don't give a rat's ass. This case is personal. One of my soldiers was killed on my watch. And I, not you, am going to clean it up. We clear?

SHAWN:
I wouldn't have gone with something as traditional as "we clear?" You could've gone foreign, right? Comprende? Capisc? Could have had a little fun with it. You dig my gist, sweetpants?

LASSITER shakes his head and walks to the conference room.

SHAWN:
(follows) These are just suggestions.

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

VICK is discussing the incident with some of the people from the re-enactment - including SALLY. SHAWN follows LASSITER inside and slips along the back to stand by SALLY.

VICK:
...and to you, the Central Reenactment Committee, I say as of today, the event next weekend is still on, pending an investigation. Now, most of you are cops. Should we find any evidence that this was not an accident and do not make an arrest, we will re-evaluate at that time. Now that said, Detective Lassiter, I want to know how, I want to know who, I want to know why. (groans at the sight of his beard)

LASSITER:
Oh, it... It's kind of hard to get off. It takes a long time to unstick the glue.

VICK just looks at him.

LASSITER:
All right.

LASSITER turns around and rips off the mustache and beard. Everyone in the room winces in sympathy. One of the men raises a hand to his handlebar mustache. LASSITER turns around, jaw clenched, and clears his throat. VICK holds out her hands and LASSITER hands them over.

LASSITER:
Thank you, Chief. Pending the coroner's report, I'd have to say there are no indications of foul play. The general consensus is that a live round got mixed in with our blanks.

SHAWN looks at SALLY but turns away when she looks at him. She turns away quickly.

LASSITER:
Mr. Mahoney is the regiment's munitions expert and jeweler, one of Santa Barbara's finest. He can expand on this. Mr. Mahoney.

MAHONEY, an older man with white hair and beard in a Union uniform stands.

MAHONEY:
As you know, Detective, we had live-round target practice this past weekend. Along with you, we assumed a musket ball got stuck in one of our rifles, laid there unseen, and then a blank was inserted during the last rehearsal... Poor Nelson. A terrible, terrible, tragic accident.

JULIET enters as MAHONEY is speaking. SHAWN and SALLY don't look at each other again.

LASSITER:
The battles meant so much to him. (MAHONEY sits) Anyway, this is an official police investigation. So let's focus on our schematic and nail down the specifics. Detective O'Hara, please.

JULIET steps forward.

SHAWN:
(to SALLY) Hey. What's the deal, why do you keep staring at me?

SALLY smiles but says nothing. JULIET moves in front of a board they have set up to show everyone's position on the field.

JULIET:
One. It's our understanding that the victim was shot off his horse at the top of the creek bank here...(se see Nelson fall off his horse) And then rolled to the creek bed here. (we see Nelson roll on the ground)

LASSITER:
Two. We know Nelson was facing west, so we're gonna focus our attentions here on the opposite bank where we assume the shot originated.

SHAWN:
Assume. (pushes way forward) Detective?

LASSITER:
Spencer?

SHAWN:
What about three, the missing bullet? I saw it ripping through Nelson's body, in through the front, out through the back. And it still hasn't been found.

VICK:
Wait. How do you know all that?

SHAWN:
Lassy, you wanna take this one?

LASSITER:
He had an "episode" in the hallway. Look, I can handle this myself.

SHAWN picks up the small army man representing Nelson Poe and holds it to his ear.

SHAWN:
Nelson, Nelson, you're going to have to speak up. You're teeny! You were shot through the heart?

VICK:
(harsh whisper) Now, that was privileged information!

LASSITER:
I didn't say anything.

SHAWN:
(shushes them) Are you sure about this? It's bold, but I'll run with it. He says people don't get shot through the heart by accident. He says he was murdered.

VICK:
You're hired.

EXT. FIELD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are walking through the camp.

GUS:
You told them what?

SHAWN:
Gus, she was hot, and she was dressed as a nurse. You know how I feel about that. Oh, come on, what was I supposed to do, not impress her? Plus, the tiny figurine made a very convincing argument.

GUS:
I don't know how you're gonna prove murder with two lousy bullet holes.

SHAWN:
Oh, relax. I did some checking on Nelson Poe, nobody liked him. Ever. And second of all...(hesitates)

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Dude, I don't have a second of all.

In the creek bed, LASSITER is directing the search. SHAWN and GUS sit on the bridge and watch.

LASSITER:
And we know Nelson was on top of the ridge, facing the Union soldiers over here when he was shot. So Schwartz, take Team A, check out that high grass. O'Hara, take Team B, start going over the ridge.

SHAWN reads the roster list of re-enactors LASSITER is holding behind his back. Some names have check marks next to them.

LASSITER:
Do it.

MEN:
(salute) Yes, sir.

SHAWN and GUS chuckle. LASSITER turns around and SHAWN gives him a mock salute.

LASSITER:
Find something amusing?

SHAWN:
Mildly amusing. More odd. Delightful, in a queer sort of way.

The search party breaks apart and LASSITER joins SHAWN and GUS on the bridge.

LASSITER:
For your edification, the reenactment of the battles...

SHAWN:
Edification?

LASSITER:
Yeah, edification.

SHAWN:
Is that legal? Like, in public. Public edification's legal?

LASSITER:
It means for your information...

SHAWN:
Why didn't you just say that?

LASSITER:
For your edification, the reenactment of battles, battles fought by our forefathers to preserve this Union, is a sacred trust. What are you guys doing here, anyway?

GUS:
I'm a bit of a Civil War buff.

SHAWN:
I'm reading the dirt. The trees. The hot dog stand. No real information there, but they do great sauerkraut. I may even be able to help you name a suspect.

LASSITER:
Look, I told you, we're 95% sure this was an accidental shooting.

SHAWN:
What about the other 5%?

LASSITER:
If I am wrong, we will hold a press conference, you two will be cordially invited to say "I told you so."

SHAWN:
Seems fair. Hey... Can I wear your face wig?

LASSITER walks away.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN dumps out a box of miscellaneous toy figures onto the air hockey table. GUS is sitting at his desk.

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
Shockingly, Lassiter is holding out on us. I do not think that he thinks that this was an accident.

GUS:
What do you mean? (stands and walks over)

SHAWN:
I saw three names checked off the roster on his clipboard.

GUS:
What names?

SHAWN:
Gus, I thought you'd never ask.

SHAWN uses the figurines and draws on the hockey table to reconstruct the battlefield. He even takes branches from a plant to act as woods.

GUS:
What is this?

SHAWN:
The battlefield.

GUS:
Based on what?

SHAWN:
The briefing room board at the police station.

GUS:
You did this from memory?

SHAWN:
Yes.

GUS:
You said you saw it for two minutes.

SHAWN:
Right, two whole minutes.

GUS:
You got problems.

SHAWN:
Factoid! (holds up small wooden hoop) The musket is accurate from 30 yards. (lays the hoop on the table encompassing two figures) Poe. G.C.

GUS:
G.C.?

SHAWN:
(flashes on the list) George Cheslow.

GUS:
George Cheslow? From sixth grade?

SHAWN:
Little Georgie!

GUS:
He's, like, a dentist now.

SHAWN:
Really?

INT. DENTIST OFFICE, RECEPTION, DAY

A mother and son are at the counter.

RECEPTIONIST:
See you in six months.

The mother and son leave and we see SHAWN and GUS sitting in front of the window.

SHAWN:
We go in, we check it out. See if George Cheslow had any reason to murder somebody. (makes exaggerated popping sound) Pop out.

RECEPTIONIST:
Mr. Guster. The dentist will see you now.

SHAWN:
Sweet.

SHAWN stands but GUS grabs him by the arm and pulls him back down into his seat.

GUS:
Whoa! Me? My teeth are gorgeous. You said the appointment was for you.

SHAWN:
Right. For me to do some snooping. Because I'm a much better snooper than you are. You just keep him occupied.

GUS:
Occupied how?

SHAWN looks at him as if to say "What a stupid question".

INT. DENTIST OFFICE, EXAM ROOM, DAY

GUS is in the dentist's chair, a mold in his mouth to take an impression of his teeth. He tries to talk but it's indecipherable. SHAWN is fiddling with a model mouth.

SHAWN:
Gus, stop it. Be a man.

GUS talks again.

GEORGE:
What's he saying?

SHAWN:
He says his teeth are gorgeous.

GEORGE:
I'm sorry, Shawn, but the reason you have to be here, too, is?

SHAWN:
George, Gus has phobias. And being alone in a dentist chair is one. He could snap at any moment. This is actually for your own protection. Last time he bit off an index finger. Thankfully, I was there. They were able to save everything but the nail.

A gorgeous blonde enters the room.

BLONDE:
Oops. Pardonne-moi. Honey, can I talk to you for a minute?

GEORGE:
Oh, sure. Gentleman, duty calls.

GEORGE gets up and walks out with the BLONDE. GUS looks at SHAWN who moths "Hot!" With GEORGE out of the room, he looks through some drawers. He then steps to the other side of the open partition to listen to the conversation.

BLONDE:
Oh, and the credit card won't go through. Do you have any cash?

GEORGE:
Oh, sure. (reaches into his pocket)

BLONDE:
I've got tennis, then dinner with Karen.

SHAWN sees that she is wearing an expensive necklace and tennis bracelet. She also cleans out GEORGE'S wallet.

GEORGE:
Okay, I'll hit an ATM, that's...

BLONDE:
Don't wait up if I'm late.

GEORGE:
Oh, okay. All right. (she kisses him on the cheek) Bye, sweetie. Good shopping. (he pats her ass and growls)

SHAWN ducks back into the room before GEORGE comes back in.

GEORGE:
Ah, yes. (sits down)

SHAWN:
George, I heard you got married, but, wow, huh?

GEORGE:
I know what you're thinking, "What's wrong with this picture?" But, you know, where is it written that the ugly guy never gets the girl?

SHAWN:
Everywhere, man.

GEORGE:
Yeah.

GEORGE stands and hits his head on the light

GEORGE:
No, we're fine. We're better, you're fine. Don't worry about it. (pats GUS on the shoulder as he goes to check the X-rays) Let's see here.

SHAWN:
So how is married life treating you these days, George? Everything...Everything solid? (looks around while GEORGE'S back is turned)

GEORGE:
Why are you snooping around here, Shawn? (turns around) You think I did this because Erlene was having an affair with Poe?

SHAWN:
Huh?

GEORGE:
You didn't know.

SHAWN:
Of course I knew, George. I'm a psychic.

GEORGE:
It was over, completely over. I'm beyond it and Erlene's beyond it. (sits back down) At least, I think she is. I... I had some gauze...(looks around) It's right...If I could just...

SHAWN flips the magnifying lenses down over GEORGE'S glasses.

GEORGE:
Oh, there you go. Thank you. (uses the gauze to wipe GUS' mouth)

SHAWN:
George, do you wear your glasses out on the battlefield?

GEORGE:
Oh, I want to, but Lassiter won't let me. He says they're not of the period. (removes the impression from GUS' mouth)

SHAWN:
Well, if it makes you feel any better, Gus here doesn't think you did it.

GUS:
Neither does Shawn.

GEORGE:
(examines GUS) Well, thanks, guys, I appreciate that. Oops!

GUS:
Oops?

GEORGE:
Small cavity.

GUS:
I don't have any cavity in my mouth...

GEORGE:
It's right on the surface. Don't worry about it. (injects Novocain)

GUS grunts.

GEORGE:
There we go. There's my trooper.

GUS:
Listen, Georgie, nobody's drilled my mouth for anything...(his words become unintelligible as the drug numbs his mouth)

LASSITER and JULIET enter with officers.

LASSITER:
George? (sees SHAWN) Why am I surprised?

SHAWN:
It is a funny coincidence. Hey, Jules.

GEORGE stands.

LASSITER:
George, I hate to say this, but you're under arrest for the murder of Nelson Poe.

GEORGE:
What? On what grounds?

SHAWN:
You said it was an accident.

LASSITER:
We discovered a stack of love letters at Nelson's house indicating he was having an affair with your wife and that you had threatened to kill him.

GEORGE:
(scoffs) Oh, come on.

LASSITER:
I am so disappointed in you.

GEORGE tries to get away but walks into a table and the officer is able to cuff him.

GEORGE:
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

JULIET and the officers take GEORGE away. GUS stands.

GUS:
(mumbles) You got the wrong man.

LASSITER:
What did he say?

SHAWN:
You've got the wrong man.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER is walking down the hall with VICK when SHAWN joins them.

SHAWN:
First, I told you so. Secondly, I think George Cheslow is an innocent man.

LASSITER:
Yeah, you know, he's right. We do have a paper-thin case.

They walk into VICK'S office.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

LASSITER:
I mean, all we've got is motive, means and opportunity.

SHAWN:
Look, guys. I had a dream last night. I was sipping iced wine with a baby tree monkey. And I fell and I landed in a wooded area. And that's where I saw Nelson Poe get shot. Only, in my dream, the shooter was much closer than I originally thought. (reaches into pocket and pulls out ammunition) This is a minie ball, am I right? (tosses it at LASSITER)

LASSITER:
(catches minie ball) Where did you get this?

SHAWN:
Your desk. Now, it's common knowledge that minie balls cause huge gaping holes in human flesh which leads to a quandary in my dream. Why was Nelson Poe's exit wound so small? If George Cheslow had been in that wooded area, he was way too far to make a shot that caused such a little hole. Whoever shot Nelson was much, much closer.

LASSITER:
And this "whoever" would be...

SHAWN:
Engelbert Humperdinck.

LASSITER:
So you've got nothing. Thank you for the random speculation. Goodbye.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, if you can't name names, I'm afraid he's right this time.

SHAWN:
Fine, I'll get you a name. (heads for door but stops in front of LASSITER) And I'm gonna get you a woman. (leaves)

VICK walks behind her desk and takes a sip of water. LASSITER looks at her.

LASSITER:
"Afraid he's right"? "This time"?

INT. MAHONEY'S JEWELRY STORE, DAY

HENRY is sitting at a table in front of the windows with MAHONEY. He has a red jewelry box in front of him. MAHONEY has an order slip.

HENRY:
It's a gift, actually, for my son. A surprise of sorts. This way he, my son, will be able to keep track of time for a change. Kid was late at birth, he's been late ever since. (holds watch) Now, he is going to have a gold pocket watch just like mine. I've had mine for 30 years.

MAHONEY:
I see. Now, the inscription. What would you like it to say?

HENRY:
"Shawn, don't lose this watch, Henry Spencer."

MAHONEY:
(writing) Spencer. (hesitates)

HENRY:
What, too much?

MAHONEY:
No, no. It's just that your son is no doubt familiar with your last name. It might contradict the sentiment.

HENRY:
All right, what would you suggest? (crosses arms)

MAHONEY:
"Love, Dad"?

HENRY:
(scoffs) "Love, Dad." Well, why don't you just put "Kissy, kissy"?

MAHONEY:
Right, too mushy. No problem. So, before we go any further, let's see. (itemizes) Vintage gold pocket watch. Gold chain. Taxes and engraving, comes to a total of... (holds the calculator up for HENRY)

HENRY:
Wait, wait, wait. Where's my discount? I'm ex-cop. Half the regiment's cop. I thought we agreed on $400.

MAHONEY:
Oh, yes, we did. But at $4 per engraved letter, that adds a total of $210.

HENRY:
All right, take away "Shawn," "this watch", "Spencer." How much does that come out to?

MAHONEY:
$56 for the engraving plus tax, $460 even.

HENRY:
And what does the revised inscription read?

MAHONEY:
"Don't lose, Henry."

HENRY:
Clean, to the point. I like it.

INT. CENTRAL COAST PHARMACEUTICALS, GUS' OFFICE, DAY

GUS is sorting through samples when there is a knock on the door and a secretary steps in.

GUS:
Come in.

SECRETARY:
Mr. Guster, I know you said you didn't want to be interrupted, but there is a Lieutenant Crunch here to see you.

GUS:
Crunch?

SHAWN appears in the doorway in a Union soldier uniform complete with cap and long sideburns.

SHAWN:
Actually, I've been promoted. It's Captain Crunch.

GUS:
Thank you.

The secretary leaves and SHAWN closes the door.

GUS:
Not in a thousand years.

SHAWN:
Dude, we're joining that regiment.

GUS:
No, we are not, Shawn.

SHAWN:
They're down to 30 guys.

GUS:
Please, I have a meeting in...

SHAWN:
And this mystery is still wide open. Gus, think about it. Camping out under the stars.

GUS:
There's just one thing you haven't considered in this perfect scenario of yours, Shawn.

SHAWN:
That's not true. I've considered everything.

GUS:
Really? And what role would I play in this production of yours?

SHAWN:
I don't... What do you...

GUS:
What role would I play in the midst of all those hardcore down-to-the-last-detail Civil War re-enactors? Would I be...

SHAWN:
No. Gus, no.

GUS:
Okay, then maybe would I be...

SHAWN:
Never. Who are you talking to? You're talking to me. This is me.

GUS:
Then what, Shawn? What would I be? Because I tell you, there is no way, no way, that I would ever, never ever...

SHAWN:
May I please tell you what I was thinking?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I was thinking Glory. I was thinking Denzel.

GUS:
Did you just say Denzel? As in Denzel Washington?

SHAWN:
No, the other Denzel. Of course. And we'll put you on a horse, and we'll give you your own sword. You're gonna have a chestful of medals. You can be anything you want. You can be a pilot.

GUS:
The Air Force wasn't formed until World War I.

SHAWN:
That's fair. So you can't be a pilot. Look, I called Mr. Mahoney, he's Mr. Uniform, and I told him to make you something spectacular.

GUS:
Denzel Washington.

INT. MAHONEY'S JEWELRY STORE, DAY

From within the store, we see SHAWN and GUS walking towards the entrance. SHAWN opens the door.

SHAWN:
Captain Mahoney, you said we needed recruits? Voil√†.

MAHONEY walks over and shakes GUS' hand.

MAHONEY:
Welcome aboard, son. (to SHAWN) I didn't expect you back so soon. Don't know if the uniforms are ready yet.

SHAWN:
But it is spectacular?

GUS:
You saw Glory?

MAHONEY:
This is the best we had. Well, come along.

The cross the floor.

SHAWN:
I told you.

INT. MAHONEY'S JEWELRY STORE, STOREROOM DAY

In the basement, aside from stock for the store, is MAHONEY'S Civil War memorabilia collection.

GUS:
Wow, Captain, it's quite an establishment you've got here.

MAHONEY:
My sanctum sanctorum. (unlocks barred door) Fine jewelry, yes. Even my vintage pocket watch collection. But above all, the finest Civil War memorabilia and props west of the Mississippi.

SALLY enters with a garment bag.

SALLY:
I can attest to that. I've repaired nearly half of them.

SHAWN:
(removes cap) Sally. I am so happy to see you, though I'm a little disappointed you're not wearing your nurse's uniform.

SALLY:
Griffin called me, frantic, saying we needed one more outfit. You okay with that?

SHAWN:
I sure am. It's just a shame you didn't dress me.

SALLY:
Still time for that.

SHAWN turns and looks at GUS.

MAHONEY:
Aside from reenacting, Sally insures half the regiment. Auto policies, homeowners. Even theft.

SHAWN:
Speaking of which, Griff, I'm thinking of insuring my legs. Sort of like Mary Hart. What do you think, three, five million a haunch? Keep in mind my calves are like carved marble.

MAHONEY:
That's not the kind of policy she writes.

SHAWN:
So she wrote yours?

MAHONEY:
Of course. And it's worth more than both your legs put together.

SHAWN:
Does that policy include plastic explosives? (holds up metal case) 'Cause I see that you're packing C-4. Is this authentic?

GUS:
Better yet, is it even legal?

MAHONEY:
For the reenactments. We fudge the fireworks sometimes. Our audience goes wild every year when the fake cannon fire showers them with dirt.

GUS:
What do we have here? (picks up a period rifle) C.S. Richmond High Hump. .58-caliber percussion  loader. (aims) Iron ramrod.

MAHONEY:
Good Lord, Burton, you are a wonk.

GUS:
(feels something on the rifle) What the heck?

MAHONEY:
Sorry. Sorry. The battlefield can be pretty messy at times. (takes rifle and gives GUS handkerchief)

JULIET senses something is wrong and runs down to the bridge. SHAWN and GUS stand up. LASSITER kneels beside the body and checks for a pulse.

SHAWN:
(picks up a glass jar) What about these jars with the buttons in them?

MAHONEY:
For the super hardcores. They soak their brass in urine.

SHAWN puts the jar back.

SALLY:
You ready to try this thing on?

GUS:
Sure.

GUS looks at himself in the mirror. He is wearing a uniform that is practically dripping in gold braid and red sash. It also has fringed gold epaulets. The hat has a large red plume. SHAWN comes up behind him.

SHAWN:
Dude, you look awesome.

EXT. RE-ENACTORS' CAMP, NIGHT

A man is playing a harmonica and small cooking fires are burning. GUS, in uniform, is walking will SALLY, who is also in costume.

GUS:
Are you sure there's not another uniform?

SALLY:
Yeah. But, I'm checking with the Ventura Association. Personally, I think you look dashing. I always loved the marching band.

SHAWN has taken his creature comforts with him and is playing an electronic golf game while sitting on an inflatable chair. Some other soldiers are watching. He is also grilling hamburgers.

SHAWN:
It's not so much me as it is Mickelson. He's good.

GUS:
(walks over to SHAWN) Shawn, we're supposed to be roughing it.

SHAWN:
Gus, for your edification, they don't have TiVo out here. Hi, Sally Reynolds. (throws away controls and stands) Keep an eye on those patties. (holds out arm for SALLY) Shall we? Let's go somewhere dark. You can give me a history lesson.

After SHAWN and SALLY walk away, GUS tries to sit in the chair without puncturing it with the sword. SHAWN and SALLY walk towards the creek bed.

SHAWN:
Captain Quantrill, he's the guy that burned down the abolitionist town?

SALLY:
Lawrence, Kansas, 1863. A year later they were hell-bent on assassinating Lincoln.

SHAWN:
But Lassiter's great-great-granddad, Muscum, he stopped 'em cold on the bridge, yeah? Sort of like a noble calling, right?

SALLY:
Something like that.

SHAWN:
And the nurse you portray, who's that?

SALLY:
Jenny Winslow. She lost her husband and two sons at Lawrence. She wanted revenge, and she got it.

SHAWN:
And what about you, Sally Reynolds? What do you want?

SALLY:
Shouldn't you already know?

SHAWN:
Why, because I'm psychic?

SALLY:
My aunt used to think she was a psychic. She got predictions wrong all the time. Then she'd get the smallest random detail right, and she'd say, "You see?"

SHAWN:
So, what you're saying is that you doubt me? That hurts my feelings.

SALLY:
Well, you still haven't guessed what I want.

They kiss. SHAWN'S foot sets down partway off the bridge.

SHAWN:
Damn it!

SHAWN falls off the bridge and rolls down the slope to the creek bed. GUS comes running. Dazed, SHAWN looks up at the sky and has a clear view at a large tree branch. GUS and SALLY run up to him.

GUS:
Shawn? What happened?

SHAWN:
Gus. I know how Nelson Poe was killed.

EXT. SPENCER HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN, still in costume, knocks on the door. HENRY opens the door.

SHAWN:
Good morning, Father.

HENRY:
(looks him over) Good morning, Your Highness.

SHAWN:
I lost your pocket watch.

EXT. CREEK BED, DAY

SHAWN is using HENRY'S metal detector along the bed where he fell the night before. HENRY is sitting on a barrel watching.

HENRY:
The truth, Shawn, you're not really my son, are you? Because I gave you a watch with the inscription "Don't lose." And what is the first thing that you do?

SHAWN:
I lose the watch.

HENRY:
You lose the watch!

SHAWN:
Well, here's a news flash, Dad. My birthday wasn't yesterday, okay? It was four months ago.

HENRY:
Yeah, well, here's a newsflash for you, kid. After you were born, it took you four months to smile at me. That's when the clock started ticking. Look, Shawn, I appreciate this newfound respect that you've got for time, but what the hell are you doing out here in the boonies with an antique gold pocket watch?

SHAWN:
I don't know, trying to clear an innocent man named George Cheslow?

The metal detector begins beeping rapidly. SHAWN kneels down, pulls a pencil from behind his ear, and begins to clear the straw on the ground. He picks up something and stands.

SHAWN:
(dejected) It's a button. (starts searching again)

HENRY:
(stands) All right, look, this case of yours, I... I've been thinking about it and...

SHAWN:
Really?

HENRY:
What? No, I haven't been "thinking." Look, killing your wife's lover is something that's rarely planned. It usually just happens. So even if this dentist Cheslow did plan it, he's not gonna be some numb nuts hanging around waiting for love letters that're gonna point the cops in his direction, right?

SHAWN:
Exactly. He's not gonna hang around like a numb nuts. So here's the deal. I think Nelson rolled into this creek and was shot from that tree right up there.

HENRY:
And you figured this out last night when you fell on your ass down here by yourself.

SHAWN:
Right on my ass. Now all I need to do is find the missing bullet.

HENRY:
And how and where do we find this missing bullet?

The metal detector beeps rapidly again. SHAWN repeats the process and looks up at HENRY.

SHAWN:
How about right here? (stabs the pencil into the ground and stands)

HENRY:
Shawn, what about the watch?

SHAWN:
(pulls watch from pocket) You mean this watch? Hey, I needed a metal detector. Target was out of stock. And you won't let anyone use yours, so... Hey, I found the bullet.

HENRY:
(mock cheers) Well, hey, you didn't find the killer, did you? You need to find the killer. (takes detector and heads for the bridge)

SHAWN:
Hell of an exit.

HENRY:
P.S., you look like an idiot.

>>>>LATER>>>>>

GUS is walking with LASSITER and JULIET to SHAWN who is standing in the creek bed.

LASSITER:
I am warning you, he'd better not be wasting my time.

GUS:
Honestly, Detective, I've never seen him so excited before.

SHAWN:
(as Lincoln) "Four score and seven years ago..."

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
(as Kennedy) "Ask not what your country can do for you..."

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
(as Kennedy) "...but what you can do for..." (normal) Gus? Is that you?

GUS:
Shawn!

LASSITER jumps down from the bridge and into the creek bed and makes his way towards SHAWN. JULIET and GUS follow.

SHAWN:
Yellow! All I see is yellow. Yellow and the number two.

LASSITER:
I'm already getting a bad feeling here.

SHAWN:
There's lead. No, graphite.

LASSITER:
Fine, I'll play. A pencil?

SHAWN:
Yes, a yellow pencil.

LASSITER:
You see a yellow pencil?

SHAWN:
Yes.

LASSITER:
Where?

SHAWN:
I'm not sure. Please, help me, Detective, please. A little to your left.

LASSITER walks to his left.

SHAWN:
Back to your right.

LASSITER goes to his right.

SHAWN:
Oh, you are getting warm, you are so warm! Oh, gosh! You're burning up! How can you stand that?

LASSITER looks down and sees the pencil sticking up from the ground between his feet. He picks it up.

LASSITER:
Great, you found a pencil. Now we can all take the SATs.

SHAWN:
There's more. The evidence, the critical evidence, it's there, just look closer. Look closer.

LASSITER scrapes away the straw using the pencil and sees the bullet. With a groan, SHAWN falls to his knees. LASSITER picks up the bullet using tweezers. JULIET opens an evidence bag and LASSITER drops the bullet inside.

SHAWN:
That's it. Gus. That's it. That's the bullet that killed Poe.

LASSITER:
And I bet when I run it through ballistics, it's gonna match George Cheslow's musket.

JULIET'S cellphone rings.

SHAWN:
No, you're wrong, it's not Cheslow.

JULIET:
O'Hara. Yeah. We're on our way. (ends call)(to LASSITER) It's a 439 in progress.

LASSITER:
Four thirty-nine?

JULIET:
Yeah.

LASSITER:
We gotta go.

JULIET and LASSITER walk to the bridge.

SHAWN:
(stutters) Wait, I was... I'm not finished! There's more!

LASSITER:
E-mail me! (helps JULIET)

SHAWN:
Juliet! I found the bullet! I...

JULIET shrugs and follows after LASSITER.

GUS:
Should we go?

SHAWN:
No. No. (stands) Let's run through this from the killer's point of view.

EXT. TREE, DAY

SHAWN is sitting on a branch in the tree he had spotted from the creek bed. GUS is standing on the ground looking up.

SHAWN:
Okay, Nelson was shot from up here. Let's do a list.

GUS:
Okay. One.

SHAWN:
The killer climbs the tree, like so.

GUS:
Right. Two?

SHAWN:
He gets ready to shoot from here. (uses his hands like a rifle)

GUS:
Three.

SHAWN:
Three. Nelson rolls down the creek, way past his mark.

GUS:
Four.

SHAWN:
Looks up, sees the bad guy.

GUS:
Okay, which means Nelson wasn't the original target!

SHAWN:
Bingo. He interrupted the plan.

GUS:
Okay, look up there and see if you see a notch. You know, that would steady a gun.

SHAWN:
A notch. (looks around)

GUS:
Yeah, like a notch.(makes sawing motion) It should lead us to the intended target.

SHAWN:
That's not a notch. That's a notch. (aims imaginary gun) The hospital tent. Dude, I think I got it.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Sally Reynolds.

GUS:
Sally Reynolds?

SHAWN:
Sally Reynolds.

GUS:
Why would someone want to kill Sally Reynolds?

SHAWN:
I have no idea.

EXT. PARK, PARKING AREA, DAY

MAN: (over speaker)
Folks, our Civil War re-enactment has begun.

SHAWN and GUS, in costume, hurry out of the Echo. SHAWN is carrying a garment bag. JULIET sees them and gets out of her car.

JULIET:
Hey, what's up, guys?

SHAWN:
You're going to get a call from a very irate Sally Reynolds saying two guys just drove by and stole her dress. Just ignore it, okay?

JULIET:
What the hell are you guys doing?

GUS:
Sally was the target. Shawn's gonna put on that dress and wait for someone to shoot him.

SHAWN:
Right, but the plan sounds a lot better when you don't say it like that. Listen, Detective, we have reason to believe that the intended target was Sally Reynolds. Now, we've stolen her dress and we're gonna catch the yellow-bellied son of a bitch red-handed. I forced the ending, that's horrible.

JULIET:
So, risking getting shot is the only way to solve the case?

SHAWN:
Absolutely.

JULIET:
Then we should stop the battle.

SHAWN:
No, we can't. It's too late. They're gonna start in less than a minute. Listen, Juliet, please let us go?

GUS is bouncing on his feet in anticipation.

JULIET:
I can't let you do that.

SHAWN and GUS groan in frustration.

JULIET:
You're a civilian. It's too dangerous.

SHAWN:
It's fine. We'll spot the guy well before he gets a shot off.

JULIET:
I'll do it. (takes garment bag)

SHAWN:
What?

JULIET:
I'll do it. (walks off)

SHAWN:
Juliet?

SHAWN and GUS follow her.

EXT. FIELD, DAY

LASSITER is leading the attack.

LASSITER:
Charge!

The re-enactment begins complete with cannon fire.

INT. HOSPITAL TENT, DAY

JULIET is bending over a table groaning as GUS and SHAWN try to zip the dress.

JULIET:
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

SHAWN:
Careful, Gus!

GUS:
Sorry! Just take a deep breath.

JULIET:
Okay.

GUS:
I don't think these dresses were intended to fit over a bulletproof vest.

SHAWN:
Remember, we will be out there watching.

JULIET:
Got you.

GUS:
To catch the bad guy before you get shot.

JULIET:
I understand.

SHAWN:
But just in case, I want you to bob left, weave right. Traditional bob and weave, no reason to get fancy out there.

GUS:
And don't become an easy target.

JULIET:
I did go to the Academy.

GUS:
Or you could die.

JULIET:
Right.

SHAWN finishes zipping up the dress and moves JULIET'S braid so it hangs down her back.

GUS:
Now remember, the fifth cannon boom is your cue to shoot whoever's playing Quantrill.

JULIET moves towards the entrance.

SHAWN:
Right. Wait, how do you know that?

GUS:
I read the manual. Didn't you?

SHAWN:
I didn't open the manual, it was like War and Peace. There were 17 chapters.

As they argue, JULIET puts on a helmet.

GUS:
It's the manual, Shawn.

SHAWN:
It was this thick...

JULIET:
Hey. Hey.

GUS:
Sorry.

SHAWN:
Sorry, sorry, sorry. All about you right now. All right, you're a champion. Now go out there and catch us a killer.

JULIET ties a bonnet over the helmet.

SHAWN:
Juliet, please be careful.

GUS:
And don't die.

SHAWN:
How many times you gonna say die?

GUS:
Shawn, just get...

JULIET opens the tent flap and flinches at the cannon.

SHAWN:
You're putting the word "die" into her head. She knows there's a killer!

JULIET:
Guys?

SHAWN:
Yeah?

JULIET:
A favor.

SHAWN:
Sure! Name it. (gets cap from a peg)

JULIET:
Kick me.

SHAWN:
Do what?

JULIET:
Kick me!

SHAWN:
Okay!

EXT. HOSPITAL TENT, DAY

JULIET is kicked out of the tent. After checking that the dress is hiding the vest, she bends over and picks up the rifle before leaving. SHAWN and GUS sneak around from the other side.

GUS:
Now what?

SHAWN:
Now we get ready to find a killer.

The two share a fist bump.

EXT. FIELD, DAY

As the battle continues, JULIET takes up her position. SHAWN and GUS stand under the tree and wait for it to happen. The man playing Quantrill rides out on his horse.

SHAWN:
Here it comes. The moment of truth.

JULIET takes her place and shoots Quantrill as scripted. When nothing happens, she looks at GUS and SHAWN and shrugs. SHAWN shrugs in return.

GUS:
Where's our killer?

As JULIET leaves, SHAWN looks up in the tree.

SHAWN:
That's weird. Nobody came.

GUS:
Well, at least Juliet is out of danger now.

GUS nearly trips over something metallic.

SHAWN:
What?

They squat down and uncover a manhole cover.

SHAWN:
Well, I wonder where this leads.

With effort, the two move the lid.

ELSEWHERE...

SHAWN climbs out of the other side of the tunnel.

SHAWN:
Watch your head.

The first thing we see of GUS as he climbs out is his plume.

SHAWN:
Oh, did you get sewage on your feather?

GUS just glares at him. They realize they are on the Confederate side.

GUS:
We've crossed to the other side of the creek bed.

SHAWN:
Yeah, the police accounted for all of the Union soldiers. But nobody's considered that the murderer could have come from this side. After all, this was the bad side, right?

GUS:
You know that's right.

They enter the tent.

INT. TENT, DAY

The tent is acting as an armory. SHAWN finds a pair of boots.

SHAWN:
May I ask, who goes out on the battlefield without their boots?

GUS:
Maybe someone has bunions.

SHAWN:
Bunions, Gus? Really? That's what you're bringing to the table? I'm trying to solve a murder here. (puts the boots down and finds something else)

GUS:
I deal with bunions at work every day, Shawn. They hurt...They hurt people. That's a perfectly logical assumption.

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah? What about this? No tunic.

GUS:
(takes tunic) This is Mahoney's!

SHAWN spots a missing button and takes out the one he found on the creek bed. He holds it against the tunic.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
The brass button.

GUS:
(whispers) Mahoney did it.

They jump up and down in excitement.

GUS:
(whispers) That's why he had that sticky musket. He must've gotten sap on it from that notch in the tree.

SHAWN:
Wait. This doesn't track. Why kill Sally? She's hot, they're friends. She even wrote his insurance policy.

There's a loud explosion.

GUS:
That was C-4!

SHAWN:
That didn't come from the battlefield, it came from the south.

They nearly solve the case simultaneously.

SHAWN:
I solved the crime.

GUS:
No, I did.

SHAWN:
I said it first.

GUS:
I identified the uniform.

SHAWN:
I found the button near the tree. I said it first. (taps GUS) Tap, tap, no take-backs.

GUS:
That's not fair, Shawn. I was identifying the C-4 sound.

SHAWN:
Dude, you snooze you lose, Gus. I don't have to tell you. That manhole we found connects to the sewer. It's going to lead us right to our killer. Let's go.

GUS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa! We're going in by ourselves?

SHAWN:
What, are you crazy?

INT. MAHONEY'S JEWELRY STORE, STOREROOM DAY

The door is off its hinges and smoke hangs in the room from the explosives. Inside the room, MAHONEY is putting his items in a sack. GUS and SHAWN arrive and stand in the doorway. GUS has his sword drawn.

GUS:
Where you going, Mahoney?

SHAWN:
Hey, Griff!

MAHONEY:
Hello, boys.

As GUS puts his sword away, MAHONEY pulls a gun.

MAHONEY:
Back off. Back off. Back off. This gun is loaded.

MAHONEY forces SHAWN and GUS into the outer room. Waiting for them are other re-enactors who aim their rifles at MAHONEY.

SHAWN:
Yes, but mine are so much bigger.

LASSITER pushes his way through.

LASSITER:
Get out of the way, I'm coming through. What the hell is going on down here?

SHAWN:
Colonel, arrest this traitor.

LASSITER:
(steps forward) I'll have that weapon, Captain.

LASSITER disarms MAHONEY. GUS and SHAWN fist bump.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK opens MAHONEY'S bag on the table.

VICK:
Okay, hold on, I'm gonna need you to walk me through this. Mahoney blew up his own vault?

GUS is hypnotizing SHAWN with the pocket watch. MAHONEY is sitting at the opposite end of the table, handcuffed. They are all still in costume.

MAHONEY:
That is an absolutely outrageous...

LASSITER:
Shut up!

SHAWN:
Not only did he blow it up, he used the battle as a cover to rob his own store. Then, he'd collect a multi-million dollar insurance policy in a couple of weeks, then slip back to the battle during the cannon fire with no one ever being the wiser. (comes out of "trance") Oh, ye immoral man of low fiber! You should really eat more bran.

MAHONEY:
I want to see my lawyer.

LASSITER:
In due time.

VICK:
Wait, but I still don't understand. Why kill Nelson Poe?

SHAWN:
That is the rub, isn't it? Sally Reynolds was the intended target. The question is why?

JULIET and SALLY enter the room. SHAWN is holding his bugle outstretched in front of him.

SHAWN:
Hi, Juliet.

JULIET:
Got your message.

SALLY:
What the hell is going on?

SHAWN:
Oh, I can see it clearly now. Sally wrote Mahoney's multi-million dollar insurance policy. That means she... (looks at SALLY and lowers bugle) She was in on the fraud from the start.

SALLY:
That's a lie.

SHAWN:
(looks at MAHONEY) But Mahoney here didn't want to share those millions, so he gets an idea. What if sweet, sweet Sally with the filthy mouth and the bedroom eyes had a little accident out on the battlefield during the rehearsal?

SALLY:
You mean Griffin tried to kill me?

GUS:
That's right.

MAHONEY:
This is a lie. You are fabricating everything you're saying.

GUS:
Now you hold on a second, Mr. Mahoney.

SHAWN:
Oh, hey, Gus, you see, when Nelson rolled down the creek bed (we see what happened as SHAWN describes it) and landed too close to the river, he looked up and he saw Griffin in the tree with his trusty musket, who said, "Griffin, now you must kill Nelson Poe to keep his stinking mouth shut."

GUS:
Told you you had the wrong person, Lassiter.

LASSITER:
I know.

VICK:
Detective O'Hara...Lose the hoop skirt before you hurt someone. Read 'em their rights and book ' em.

JULIET takes SALLY out of the room and two officers take MAHONEY.

LASSITER:
Excuse me, gentlemen.

SHAWN:
Hey, it was good work, Detective. We got 'em.

LASSITER:
"We"?

SHAWN:
We're a team, right?

SHAWN and GUS salute LASSITER. He leaves the room.

1986

EXT. FIELD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are in scout uniforms walking through a field. SHAWN is carrying a volleyball.

SHAWN:
Gus. When we grow up, think I'll ever be as cool as you?

GUS:
You're better at kickball.

SHAWN:
Not what I asked.

GUS:
We talking about your dad again?

SHAWN:
Mmm-hmm.

GUS:
Come on, dude. The guy respects you.

SHAWN:
Not like he does you.

GUS:
I'm not his son. I mean, he might like me okay, but he loves you.

SHAWN:
Did he say that?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Then how can you be sure?

GUS:
You mean he's never said it?

SHAWN:
Come on, Gus. We're guys.

SHAWN drops the ball and it rolls in front of a culvert. SHAWN picks up the ball and the boys look at each other.

BOTH:
Charge!

They run into the culvert.

Episode 1x08 Shawn vs. the Red Phantom

Look! I did it! Sorry it took so long.




1986

EXT. BEACH, DAY

SHAWN is running along the beach, arms outstretched, a towel around his neck acting as a

cape. He runs home.

EXT. SPENCER HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN runs into the yard.

SHAWN:
Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than...

SHAWN stops when he sees HENRY in uniform sitting on the steps, flipping through a magazine.

HENRY:
Hey.

SHAWN:
Hey.

HENRY holds up the magazines.

HENRY:
Where did these comics come from? Gus, right? Come here. (SHAWN walks over) Well, at
least you're not a tattletale. (tosses the comics to the ground)

SHAWN:
What's the big deal? All the kids read them.

HENRY:
Yeah, well, all the kids don't live in this house, and all the kids don't have a police officer as a father, Shawn.

SHAWN:
So what?

HENRY:
So, these things make cops look like idiots who'd rather flash a signal in the sky than do real
police work. They set a bad example.

SHAWN:
They do not. (picks up comics)

HENRY:
(stands) Shawn, don't argue with me. Do you have any idea of how many kids' brains I have
to scoop up off the driveway because they think they can fly?

SHAWN:
Those kids are dumb.

HENRY:
Shawn, these things are a fantasy. Real heroes do not wear a cape and they don't wear their underwear on the outside. The guys who wear capes... they're on angel dust. Come here. (puts a hand on SHAWN'S head and guides him to the steps where they sit) You want to know what a
real hero is?

SHAWN:
What?

HENRY:
He's flesh and blood. He wears a badge. He lays it on the line every time he walks the beat. Shawn, do you really want to be a hero someday?

SHAWN:
Yes, sir.

HENRY:
Become a cop. Get your head out of the clouds.

SHAWN sighs.

HENRY:
All right, let's see if we can make this thing useful somehow, huh? (takes the towel from around SHAWN'S shoulders and drapes it over his head) Hit the showers. (kisses SHAWN'S head)

SHAWN heads inside.

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is sitting at her desk, rubbing her tired neck and shoulders. The phone rings and she
picks it up.

SHAWN: (over phone)
Somebody needs a hot oil massage.

JULIET:
Pardon?

SHAWN: (over phone)
Stress? Tough day at the office? Who are you kidding? You'll probably never get those reports typed.

JULIET:
Who is this?

SHAWN: (over phone)
Shawn.

JULIET:
Spencer.

SHAWN: (over phone)
Great, you were already thinking about me. You know, you should roll your head both directions
if you really want that to work.

JULIET:
(taps her fingers on the desk and looks around) Okay, where are you?

SHAWN: (over phone)
On the phone. Where are you?

JULIET:
You know damn well where I am. How can you see me? (stands)

SHAWN: (over phone)
Do you really want to know?

JULIET:
I don't ask questions I don't want to know the answer to.

SHAWN: (over phone)
Then never ask a boyfriend if he thinks your sister's hot.

JULIET:
I don't have a sister.

SHAWN: (over phone)
How about a boyfriend?

JULIET:
Where are you? (looks around the department)

SHAWN: (over phone)
Well, there's a spectral plane where all of our auras are visible, see. When a soul is tortured
or stressed, like yourself...

JULIET:
Okay, never mind.

SHAWN: (over phone)
You asked.

JULIET:
You know what, Shawn? (goes back to desk) I have a really hectic day today. (picks up
notepad) The chief, she's...

SHAWN: (over phone)
Out of the office. Going to a seminar on non-lethal weaponry with Lassiter? Out of town? She
sort of left you in charge?

JULIET:
(drops pad on desk) Okay, psychic. Give me the details. How did you figure that out?

SHAWN: (over phone)
Most of it is in her day planner.

JULIET looks in the direction of VICK'S office and sees SHAWN sitting in her chair, facing in
the opposite direction, holding up the day planner. JULIET gasps. SHAWN turns around.

JULIET:
You cannot be in the Chief's office.

SHAWN: (over phone)
Oh, come on. She's not going to know. Notice how no one ever looks in here? Why is that? What are you guys so afraid of? It's not like the belly bites. She's actually a pretty kick-back lady
if you give her a chance. Look what she's done with this place, it's really warm in here. I know
I can't stay away. And have you tried this chair? (looks at JULIET and smiles)

JULIET:
Okay, you have five seconds to get your butt out of... (looks at notepad) Actually, you
know what? Stay right there.

SHAWN: (over phone)
Ooh, indecisive. I like that.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

JULIET enters and SHAWN is sitting at the desk and claps his hands. JULIET tosses the notepad
on the desk.

JULIET:
Take a look at that. Tell me what you think. (closes the blinds)

SHAWN:
(reads notepad) Flower doodle in the upper right-hand corner is excellent. This horse at
the bottom doesn't look anything like My Little Pony.

JULIET:
The writing, not the... That's a dog. I draw when I get anxious.

SHAWN:
I think you made a wise decision not going into animation, Juliet.

JULIET:
(sits) Mmm.

SHAWN:
Okay, fine. Something about a missing kid.

JULIET:
He's not a kid. He's 18. And he's only been gone for 24 hours, so technically he's not missing.

SHAWN:
You want my help.

JULIET:
I'm not sure yet. His name is Malone Breyfogle.

SHAWN:
Malone Breyfogle?

JULIET:
Mmm-hmm.

SHAWN:
I'll tell you this much, kid's been lifted up by his underwear more than once.

JULIET:
He seems like a good kid. Honor roll, never been in trouble. His mother's worried sick.

SHAWN:
You can't do anything until he's been missing for 48 hours? (gets up and walks around to the
front of the desk) That's so stupid.

JULIET:
Exactly. I know the rules and regulations. They made sense when I memorized them, but... When
you have to look into some poor mother's eyes and tell her she can't worry about her son until
he's two days missing...

SHAWN:
That is really depressing. Consider me hired.

JULIET:
You're not hired. I can't pay you. If it turns out there's something to it, I'll make sure you
get put on the case. That's all I can do.

SHAWN:
Juliet, (picks up notepad) I'm quite sure we can work out some kind of services exchange.
You see, I like to do a little sketching myself, and sometimes I need a model.

Juliet scoffs, stands, takes the notepad and leaves the office.

SHAWN:
Was that inappropriate? Felt okay.

EXT. STREET, DAY

GUS and SHAWN are crossing the road.

GUS:
Let me get this straight. I left in the middle of work to come check out a case, which is not a
case, in which we likely won't get paid.

They walk up a driveway.

SHAWN:
Who are you kidding right now? I pulled you out of a Starbucks. Where you were pretending to
finish your route that you actually finished yesterday so we could do a tiny favor for Juliet
that will grant us much larger favors in the future. (rings doorbell) Preferably ones
that I can't mention in the presence of nuns or men of the cloth.

The door is opened by MRS BREYFOGLE.

MRS BREYFOGLE:
Oh, hello. Thank you so much for coming. Come in. Can I get you boys anything?

SHAWN and GUS step inside and she closes the door.

INT. BREYFOGLE LIVING ROOM, DAY

GUS and SHAWN are sitting on the couch. SHAWN is hugging a pillow.

MRS BREYFOGLE:
(calls from other room) They'll be ready in a minute.

GUS:
I can't believe you're letting that woman make us pancakes.

SHAWN:
She offered, Gus. Tell me you're not excited about pancakes.

GUS:
She's worried sick.

SHAWN:
Cooking helps her cope.

GUS:
How do you know that?

SHAWN:
How do you know it doesn't?

MRS BREYFOGLE:
(from kitchen) Do you boys want your syrup warmed up?

SHAWN:
(calls) I don't need it, Mrs. Breyfogle, but Gus does, so, I guess, yes.

GUS:
You're the one who won't eat cold syrup.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but I'm working you into the conversation. Now she knows your name.

MRS BREYFOGLE enters the living room with SHAWN'S plate, already having given GUS his. They
use the pillows on their laps as a flat surface for the plates.

MRS BREYFOGLE:
I'm just afraid something terrible has happened. (gives SHAWN his plate) Here you go.
(sits in chair) My son, Malone, has been acting so strange lately.

GUS:
(swallows) Strange how?

MRS BREYFOGLE:
Well, he worked so hard to get a paid summer internship with a big computer company, then turned
it down at the last second, wouldn't tell me why. Rarely leaves his room. Even his two oldest
friends, Rob and Don, tell me they hardly get to see him.

SHAWN:
Have you spoken with Rob and Don since Malone disappeared?

MRS BREYFOGLE:
No. I spoke to their parents. Both boys are at computer camp.

SHAWN and GUS exchange a look.

SHAWN:
All right. These are delicious.

GUS:
Yes.

SHAWN:
But I need to see his room.

INT. BREYFOGLE HOME, MALONE'S ROOM, DAY

MRS BREYFOGLE leads SHAWN and GUS into the room. It is a mess with comics strewn about the
floor and the bed unmade. There is also a photo of three boys smiling into the camera. SHAWN
"sees" plaster on the bed and looks to the ceiling where there is a recessed light.

MRS BREYFOGLE:
Are you all right?

SHAWN:
I feel the answer is in the light.

MRS BREYFOGLE:
The light?

SHAWN reaches back to the switch on the wall and keeps turning the light on and off.

GUS:
(whispers) Shawn? Will you tell the spirit to hurry the hell up?

SHAWN moves over and steps on the bed, hands reaching the low ceiling around the light.

SHAWN:
Oh, yes. (stands in the center of the bed) Yes, I'm definitely feeling something here.

(looks at GUS and slowly bounces) It's good. It's nice.

MRS BREYFOGLE:
What? What is it?

SHAWN:
This mattress. It feels like one of those mattresses where you can bounce a bowling ball, but
the glass of wine doesn't spill. Gus, go find a glass of wine and a bowling ball.

GUS only glares at him impatiently.

SHAWN:
Mrs. Breyfogle, I feel we'll find a clue in here.

SHAWN takes out the bulb and cash showers down.

EXT. STREET, DAY

GUS and SHAWN leave the house and walk down the driveway.

GUS:
How does some 18-year-old kid still living at home make that kind of money?

SHAWN:
Lemonade stand? That is, if instead of lemons, he's using heroin.

GUS:
Whatever it is, anything that pays in stacks of cash like that can't be legal. Or healthful.

SHAWN:
It's obvious what happened. Malone was involved in some shady dealings. He's either off on a
spending spree or things got a little too shady for him.

They cross the street to the car.

GUS:
So, what now?

SHAWN:
Find his friends. Computer camp, please. Malone's rolling in dough. Whatever he's doing, they're
with him. We find them, we find him. The question is where.

GUS:
(points at him with car key) Wait a second. You don't already know where he is?

SHAWN:
Gus, I'm a professional gathering information, okay? I'm getting there.

GUS:
(chuckles) You know, Shawn, I... I just thought you were a little better than this. Just
a little.

SHAWN:
All right, what is this? You know where he is?

GUS:
(leans against car) Of course I do. While you're playing with light switches and ordering
breakfast, I was investigating a case. (swings the keys in his hand)

SHAWN:
I see. Okay. Okay, I'll bite. (leans against the car and crosses his arms) Where is he,
Chocolate Columbo?

GUS:
Tri-Con.

SHAWN:
Do what?

GUS:
Tri-Con. The Tri-Annual Comic Book and Science Fiction Convention is in Santa Barbara this
weekend. You saw all those comic books in Malone's room. You're 18 years old. You have a ton of
cash burning a hole in your pocket and you love comics. Where else would you go to spend your
disposable income? Think, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Gus, I apologize. That's brilliant.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
Let's verify it so we can go check it out.

GUS:
Shawn, I'm sure he's there. There's no doubt.

SHAWN:
You're sure?

GUS:
Yep.

SHAWN:
How's that?

GUS reaches into his pocket, pulls out a piece of paper, unfolds it and shows SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Are those directions to the convention center?

GUS:
I found it in his wastebasket.

INT. LASSITER'S CAR, ON THE ROAD, DAY

LASSITER is driving while VICK has her head turned, looking out the window.

LASSITER:
You know, in case I never said it, I was really pleased when you were named as chief. Interim
chief. I'm sure that's only temporary.

VICK:
Mmm-hmm.

LASSITER:
It's true that the outgoing chief was important to me. He was my mentor. Made me the cop I am
today.

VICK:
Mmm-hmm.

LASSITER:
I know the outside perception is that the force was a real boys' club under him, so I thought it
was really smart when they named a, you know, woman.

VICK:
All right, honey.

LASSITER:
(glances at VICK) Excuse me, what?

VICK:
I love you.

LASSITER:
Huh?

VICK:
(chuckles) Okay. (hand pushed back hair to reveal Bluetooth) Yeah, I'll just see
you when we get back. Okay. (looks at LASSITER) I'm sorry, Detective, were you saying
something?

LASSITER:
No, I wasn't.

INT. CONVENTION CENTER, ENTRANCE HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS approach the entrance into the main convention hall.

GUS:
We can't just walk into the con.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, "the con"?

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
You're calling a place filled with overweight teenagers battling mild cases of scoliosis and
advanced bed-wetting "the con"?

GUS:
We can't get in there. The tickets were sold out a month ago.

SHAWN:
Did you already try to get tickets?

GUS:
Focus, Shawn.

SHAWN:
How much were they?

GUS:
Will you focus?

SHAWN is distracted by something happening behind GUS. A man in a casual suit takes a poster
advertising the presence of George Takei from an easel, hiding it.

MAN:
No, no, no, leave this out of sight until we get the issues resolved with the food in his room,
all right? I don't know if he's going to walk over the blueberry issue, but we cannot have
people lining up until we're sure he's participating. (picks up poster and dials cell) I
gotta call his agent. (walks away) Get me a list of all the produce vendors in the area.
We can't risk alienating the Star Trek fans.

SHAWN and GUS try to get inside.

SECURITY:
You can't come in without tickets.

SHAWN:
They didn't tell you we were coming?

SECURITY:
Who?

SHAWN:
We work for George. Takai?

SECURITY:
You mean Takei?

SHAWN:
Yeah. Those closest to him know exactly how he likes it pronounced, okay? You think you can have
a convention without Commander Chekov?

GUS:
(whispers) Sulu, jackass.

SHAWN:
Have his fresh blueberries arrived yet?

SECURITY:
(checks clipboard) I don't have record of receiving them yet.

SHAWN:
You don't have record of having received them yet. Give me that. (takes clipboard and flips
page)  They don't have the fresh blueberries. (laughs and looks at GUS)

GUS and the SECURITY man join with forced laughter. SHAWN slams the clipboard onto the
podium.

SECURITY:
(stammers) What's the big deal?

SHAWN:
What's the big deal? What is the big deal? Do you have any idea what happened when they forgot
his blueberries at the con in San Antonio? That comb-over will be the least of your...
(regains control) You know what, it's better. It's better if you don't know. It's how I
ended up with a stutter and a wooden pinky toe. Now for the love of Scotty...

GUS:
(whispers) Still Sulu.

SHAWN:
Would you...(stutters) Please, let me get in there and save all of our asses?

The SECURITY man lets them through.

INT. CONVENTION CENTER, MAIN HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the main hall that is lined with booths and people milling about, a large
amount in costume.

SHAWN:
Dude, some guy in a wolf costume with a light saber just said hi to you.

GUS:
I don't know that guy.

SHAWN:
He looked right at you.

GUS:
He was mistaken.

SHAWN:
He said, "Hi, Gus". And then another dude with a cape and a codpiece gave you a half-nod.

GUS:
I don't know any of these people, Shawn, okay?

SHAWN:
Uh-huh.

A young WOMAN at one of the booths hands them each a flier.

WOMAN:
Hey, guys. I'm Talia. This is Dent. We're from Parastone Pictures and just wanted to remind you
to go see the world premiere of the Red Phantom trailer tomorrow night.

DENT:
It'll be the biggest movie of the summer. Do not miss out.

SHAWN:
No way, I love the dead phantom.

TALIA:
Red Phantom.

SHAWN:
What, he didn't die at the end? (walks away with GUS) Bye.

TALIA:
Bye.

GUS:
I hear this movie's going to bomb.

MAN ON P.A.:
Check one. Check two.

GUS:
Too bad. I kind of dug the Red Phantom.

SHAWN:
You haven't even seen the trailer, you already hate it, how's that possible?

GUS:
Fortress of Attitude.

SHAWN:
What did you just say to me?

GUS:
Fortress of Attitude. It's this site that reviews movies based on comic books. The
Malcontent, the guy who runs it, says he already saw a 30-minute presentation here at the
convention. He blazed it online.

SHAWN:
Can't you just look at porn on the net like every other guy and his brother?

GUS:
Everybody reads this blog.

SHAWN:
No. Not everybody.

GUS:
Everybody here does, Shawn.(stops walking) And you know what? I don't care what you
think. So why don't you let me do the talking here at the convention, and try not to embarrass
me. This is my turf. And yes, I know the guy in the codpiece. His name is Dave. And he's a very
nice guy. (struts off in the other direction)

SHAWN:
(watches him go) Snap.

They wander through the exhibits and GUS picks up a few things. At one booth a man is signing
autographs.

MAN:
Two for 50 cents.

GUS stops and looks over SHAWN'S shoulder.

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
That's Hiltz Kooler. (walks over to the MAN signing autographs) Excuse me, Mr. Kooler?
I'm a huge Green Spirit fan. He's my favorite, actually. I was wondering, (reaches into bag
and pulls out comic) would you mind signing my original copy of The Green Spirit Strikes
Again? (hands KOOLER the comic)

KOOLER:
Whoa. Haven't seen one of these in a while. (signs comic)

GUS:
I couldn't believe I found a guy selling one. I love how this story reinvented the character for
today.

KOOLER:
Well, there you go. (hands back comic) Enjoy. It's one of my favorites.

GUS:
You know, I wish they'd based the movie on this story arc. (puts comic back in bag)

KOOLER:
What am I gonna do? I told them about a million times. They don't listen to me.

GUS:
Still a huge fan.

KOOLER:
Well, I'm glad someone is after that Green Spirit movie.

SHAWN:
Wait, wait, wait. Is this the movie you dragged me to where the hero had big nipples on the
outside of his costume?

KOOLER:
Damn those nipples.

SHAWN:
(laughs) They were like big angry marshmallows.

GUS:
(drags SHAWN away) Be nice to him, Shawn. The Green Spirit movie nearly killed the
character.

SHAWN:
Gus, all I care about is finding our guys. I can't take much more of this.

GUS:
There's too much real estate. We can't cover it all at once. Maybe we should split up.

SHAWN:
I can help our situation. (walks off)

Up onstage is the MAN who didn't want to promote George Takei due to the blueberries. He is
the Events COORDINATOR.

COORDINATOR: (into microphone)
So, next on our list... (SHAWN goes onstage and stands next to him on the podium) Sir,
can I help you?

SHAWN:
Yeah, I'm Shawn Spencer, psychic, SBPD. I just need a moment.

COORDINATOR:
Psychic?

SHAWN:
Mmm-hmm.

COORDINATOR:
Welcome. (into microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, science fiction fans, we've got a
special treat for you today, we have a psychic, a real live professional psychic.

GUS gets up onstage and stands beside SHAWN.

GUS:
(whispers) Shawn, no.

COORDINATOR:
Who's this?

The crowd clamors.

SHAWN:
This is my sidekick, Magic Head.

A MAN in the crowd raises his hand.

MAN:
You're a psychic? Like Professor X?

GUS:
Professor X is a telepath, not a psychic.

SHAWN:
But I do have telepathic tendencies.

GUS:
No, you don't. You have psychic visions. They're different.

SHAWN:
No, really, I can do both.

GUS:
No, you can't.

MAN:
Can you read me?

SHAWN:
Sure. (SHAWN wiggles the fingers of his right hand by his temple and places his right on GUS'
head. GUS ducks out from under it) I'm getting a reading. I'm getting a reading right now,
yes. You spend a great deal of time in front of your computer.

The man gasps and the crowd murmurs. SHAWN reaches for GUS' head again, but GUS knocks his
hand away.

SHAWN:
And, I see a girl. Yes. You like her from afar. She doesn't really know you exist.

MAN:
Yes. Yes. Her name's Megan. Do I have a chance?

SHAWN:
(hesitates) Don't put too much work into it. I think she might want to be "just friends."

GUS:
(whispers) Shawn, we're supposed to be looking for Malone.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Obviously Malone is keeping a low profile. (pretends to get another
vision) Whoa! Boy, I'm getting...Whoa! I'm getting an "R." I am getting an "R." (walks
back and forth across the stage) Does anyone here have a name that begins with "R"? Oh, wait
a second...Hold, nobody... and a "D." Yes a "D." An "R" and a "D." (stammers) An "R"
name... Rim... Rolph... Robert... No "bert," just Rob. Rob. And a "D" name, yes. Uh, Dan. Uh,
Doodle. Dook... Dook...Dookie... Duder... Dumb...Don! Yes! Rob and a Don.

Two teenage BOYS in the back raise their hands.

BOYS:
(shout) That's us!

The crowd applauds as the BOYS come forward.

SHAWN:
An actual Rob and Don together. (chuckles) Sometimes I scare myself.

ROB and DON come onstage.

SHAWN:
Hey, fellas, first I need you both to empty your pockets.

ROB and DON do so and hold the contents in their cupped hands.

SHAWN:
Mmm... Oh!(takes an object from one of the boys) A room key. Even though you both reside
locally.

ROB:
Oh, our friend sprang for a hotel suite for us.

SHAWN:
Ah, room 129.

DON:
428.

SHAWN:
Yes, of course. (reaches for GUS' head again) I'm getting something. This friend you
speak of, I sense you haven't seen him for a while, but you didn't tell anyone, no. You're not
supposed to be here. You told your parents you were going to computer camp. Computer camp, guys?
Really? (makes another attempt at GUS' head but GUS blocks him) I know what you're
hiding.

Scared, the BOYS run from the stage.

GUS:
We're not going after them?

SHAWN:
What for? Malone's not with them. But I think I know where he might be.

SHAWN and GUS leave the stage.

COORDINATOR: (into microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, Shawn Spencer and Magic Head.

INT. CONVENTION CENTER, HALLWAY, DAY

SHAWN and GUS exit the exhibition hall.

SHAWN:
Let's check out room 428.

They start down the hallway. Ahead of them is the SECURITY man from earlier speaking with
George TAKEI.

SECURITY:
Well, they seemed pretty convincing. That's them there!

TAKEI:
(walks over) Why are you telling people you're my assistants?

SHAWN:
(looks at GUS)(hesitantly) Because we are your assistants.

TAKEI:
Excuse me?

SHAWN:
Are you serious, George? (scoffs) I know we said we'd work outside the loop, but this is
a little ridiculous.

TAKEI:
I don't recognize you.

SHAWN:
You hired us personally. We met you in Chicago at a screening of that movie with the whales.

GUS:
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.

TAKEI:
The last time I was in Chicago, I was doing a reading from my autobiography.

SHAWN:
Right. We booked that. (to GUS) Remember Robin told us he'd never be able to fill a room
that size?

GUS:
Yeah.

TAKEI:
I don't know any Robin.

SHAWN:
That's because I fired her. Look, George, you don't need that kind of negativity, okay? It's her
fault what happened in San Antonio. Though you didn't hear that from me.

TAKEI:
I'm very confused.

SHAWN:
Look, George, we can stand around and talk all day...

GUS:
Like Robin used to.

SHAWN:
Or I can try to do something about solving your blueberry crisis. The choice is yours.

TAKEI:
Well, all right, then. Get to it.

SHAWN:
Thank you. (walks on)

GUS:
Thank you. (follows SHAWN)

INT. MALONE'S HOTEL ROOM, DAY

The room is trashed.

SHAWN:
Ew!

GUS:
Gosh. I see why Rob and Don were freaked. They didn't want to be held responsible for this mess.
(closes door)

SHAWN:
This place is trashed.

GUS:
Maybe Johnny Depp stopped by. (laughs at own joke as walks around room)

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, did that joke just arrive in a time machine from 1992?

GUS:
He used to trash hotel rooms.

SHAWN:
Used to. The man has kids now. He lives in France.

GUS:
You got a better version?

SHAWN:
Of course I do. How about that lame-o who's dating Kate Moss?

GUS:
He's British and nobody knows who he is.

SHAWN:
Okay, fine. Too inside. Stephen Dorff. Always solid. (sees flyers for The Malcontent)
Dude, come here.

GUS:
Why would this kid have these mock-ups?

SHAWN "zooms" in and highlights letters in the word: MALcONtEnt.

SHAWN:
Because I think our missing person has a secret identity. By day, he's a laptop-toting, comic-
loving virgin. At night, he's your favorite blogger.

GUS:
You think The Malcontent is a kid?

SHAWN:
He must have pissed off the wrong people with his blog.

GUS:
(sees a handwritten note on a table) Shawn, look.

SHAWN:
"One down, two to go." Hmm. There goes the kid-on-a-spending-spree theory. Oooh. Keith Moon.

GUS nods in agreement.

INT. SBPD, DAY

SHAWN is leaning against a desk when GUS joins him.

GUS:
I just went over the posts on Malone's blog.

SHAWN:
Did he bash anything in particular?

GUS:
The Red Phantom movie. He's relentless. It's weird, because if you go back a little, he
was originally saying great things about it.

They walk upstairs to the main floor.

SHAWN:
So Parastone Pictures paid him to praise the Red Phantom flick. That must be where all
the money from his room came from.

GUS:
Makes sense. Malone's blog started the bad buzz which sunk Parastone's last comic book movie.

SHAWN:
I don't think the nipples helped either, Gus.

GUS:
Well, yeah.

SHAWN:
So the studio had everything riding on this new film. They would have done anything to prevent
history from repeating itself.

GUS:
But Malone blazed The Red Phantom anyway.

SHAWN:
He reneged, which might be why he's missing. We need to find those execs.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET stands when she sees them.

JULIET:
Hey. Any progress?

SHAWN:
I picked up Malone's astral trail. (JULIET looks at him) That's what it's called. It
leads to a hotel across from the convention center. Room 428. Oak door, can't miss it.

JULIET:
That's more specific than usual.

SHAWN:
Sometimes the spirits are in a giving mood. You won't find Malone, but I sense some seriously
dark juju magumbo went down in there.

JULIET:
(picks up phone) Yeah, send some uniforms to the hotel across from the convention center
and tell them to cordon off room 428. Good. (hangs up phone)(to SHAWN) This had
better be for real. (picks up jacket and walks with them) So, how's the convention? A lot
of cool stuff going on, I bet.

SHAWN:
Oh, come on. Not you, too.

GUS:
You're a collector, too?

JULIET:
Since middle school.

GUS:
(stops walking) I just got Hiltz Kooler's autograph.

JULIET:
(whirls around) Shut up, you did not?

GUS:
Yes, I did.

SHAWN:
(raises hand) Hi. Missing kid, worried mom. Can we focus here?

GUS:
Since when did you get so structured?

SHAWN:
Since you turned into Urkel (stammers) and you just became (stammers) Jan Brady...

GUS:
Wow.

SHAWN:
Tina Yothers... There's... There's not an exact match for that.

JULIET walks away.

GUS:
You didn't want to tell her about our suspicions with the Parastone executives?

SHAWN:
Please, Gus, we have to leave something to divine later.

They follow after JULIET.

INT. LASSITER'S CAR, ON THE ROAD, DAY

LASSITER and VICK sit facing forward, both silent. LASSITER tries to make conversation.

LASSITER:
Yeah. This is nice. It's good one-on-one time. Let the guard down. You know, I had an idea not
too long ago, and it's funny I should think of it now, but it really doesn't make any sense to
have so many officers working the daytime shift at Grab.

VICK:
(shows discomfort) Detective.

LASSITER:
(continues without having heard) Since most car thefts occur at night.

VICK:
Lassiter.

LASSITER:
Now, if you were to split the shift, go with me on this...

VICK:
Carlton!

LASSITER:
What?

VICK:
My water just broke.

LASSITER:
Are you sure?

VICK:
No, Carlton, there's water spilling out of me for some other reason.

LASSITER:
Oh, no. Oh, can you move my briefcase?

VICK:
Your briefcase?

LASSITER:
It might be in the line of the...

VICK:
Do you understand how uncomfortable this is?

LASSITER:
It's leather. I didn't Scotchguard it! (VICK is aghast) You know what, never mind. Just
has tremendous sentimental value.

VICK:
Just take me to the nearest hospital. All right? (LASSITER goes to put the light on the
roof) Oh, I don't think we need that.

LASSITER:
Oh, I think we do. (puts light on roof) Do you know what? We'll use the siren, too. For
you. Just in case. (flips on siren)

The car speeds down the highway.

EXT. CONVENTION CENTER, DAY

As SHAWN and GUS exit, KOOLER is just going in.

KOOLER:
Hey, guys.

GUS:
Hey.

KOOLER:
Can't stop to talk. Got to sign autographs. (goes inside)

SHAWN:
Look, dude, I got a date with that Talia girl from the studio in, like, an hour. A nice romantic
walk on the beach to Jim's. Best scungilli in Santa Barbara.

GUS:
Why couldn't you just talk to her now?

SHAWN:
Because, Gus, happy hour doesn't start until 5:00.

GUS:
You're supposed to be figuring out if she's innocent.

SHAWN:
That's exactly what I plan to do.

They stop short when George TAKEI appears in front of them.

TAKEI:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
GT.

TAKEI:
The blueberries are still wrong. I requested North Carolina blueberries, but they sent me
Michigan blueberries. People say I'm crazy, but I can taste the difference.

SHAWN:
I don't think that's crazy at all.

TAKEI:
And I requested that my green room not be at the end of the hall. I have to be in the middle.
It's affecting my chi.

SHAWN:
Gus.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Did you skimp out and get the Michigan blueberries?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
And screw up the room location? And what are you doing to George's chi? Are you touching it and
whatnot? Stop it. This is my fault, Mr. Takei. My fault for farming out responsibilities that I
should have seen to personally. My humblest apologies. We'll get you the right blueberries as
soon as possible and a better room assignment. You have my word.

TAKEI:
Well, all right, then. (looks at GUS) Good help is hard to find, I suppose. (walks off)

GUS:
Why did you blame that on me?

SHAWN:
Dude, we needed a fall guy.

GUS:
I can't be the fall guy in front of one of my heroes, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Okay, then you and I need to create a third imaginary assistant that's completely incompetent. I
think her name should be Beatrice. What say you?

GUS doesn't answer, just walks off.

EXT. BEACH, DAY

SHAWN is walking with TALIA, who is on her phone.

TALIA: (into phone)
All right, yeah, just send it to my assistant.

SHAWN:
It's tremendous. You don't mind it, though. You don't mind all the comic book stuff?

TALIA:
It's fun, harmless, a little wish fulfillment. Oh, come on, you didn't pretend to fly around
like Superman when you were a kid?

SHAWN:
(ignores question) So, uh, pretty high stakes on the Red Phantom movie, huh?

TALIA:
We, uh, took a bath a couple of years ago on this other comic book movie, The Adventures of
the Green Spirit.

SHAWN:
Yeah, the nipple flick.

TALIA:
God, is that all anyone remembers about that movie?

SHAWN:
Yes.

TALIA:
Ugh, we had to build a landfill for the unsold action figures. So, we're pulling out all the
stops to launch the trailer for the Red Phantom movie. You know, lasers, music. Dent even
organized this whole pyrotechnics display. Word of mouth is the first and most vital step in
this world.

SHAWN:
Vital enough to pay somebody off?

They stop walking.

TALIA:
What?

SHAWN:
Hmm? Let's say there's a blogger, right? And he's wielding way more power than he should. And he
can be had for a price. You guys would be fools not to take a shot, right?

TALIA:
Who are you, Shawn?

SHAWN:
I'm a psychic. I work with the police. I'm investigating a disappearance. Malone Breyfogle. The
Malcontent. I'm sensing you probably know a lot about him.

TALIA:
Okay, this conversation is over.

SHAWN:
No. It's just starting to get good. See, he reneged on a promise and now he's missing.

TALIA:
Missing? Look, whether or not this guy had a consultation fee is beside the point. We don't harm
people. It's just a movie.

SHAWN:
Just a movie? You think your boss will tell me the same thing?

TALIA:
I don't know. Why don't we go ask him together?(heads off) Dent is back at our convention
headquarters.

SHAWN:
Fine. So, no scungilli, then?

INT. CONVENTION CENTER, STAIRS, DAY

SHAWN:
I didn't expect you to be so cooperative, so if I seemed a little pushy...

TALIA:
Accusing me of kidnapping?

SHAWN:
I accused you of bribery. I implied you may have had something to do with the kidnapping.
There's a difference.

INT. CONVENTION CENTER, HALL, DAY

SHAWN:
You know, a lot of couples start off on the wrong foot. It just means we have nowhere to go but
up.

TALIA:
Well, when you're done here with Dent, we're done. (opens door to office)

INT. CONVENTION CENTER, OFFICE, DAY

The office is a wreck, similar to Malone's room.

TALIA:
What the... Oh, my God. What happened here? Where is he?

SHAWN:
(walks into the room) Some seriously dark juju magumbo went down in here. (sees note
on the desk) "Two down, one to go." (claps hands together) Okay, good news, your boss
is innocent. Bad news, he just became a face on a milk carton.

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk along the sidewalk. They stop at a churro vendor and SHAWN orders two.

GUS:
I checked Malone's blog again today. There are more entries blazing the Red Phantom
movie. I think Malone was kidnapped before the blogs showed up. He was probably going to honor
his deal with Parastone. (takes his order)

SHAWN:
So, the kidnapper is the one roasting this new movie online? (gets his order)

GUS:
He also wrote, "The guilty will pay."

SHAWN:
The guilty will pay?

GUS:
Yep.

SHAWN:
Wow.

They cross the street to beach path.

SHAWN:
One of these comic book freaks has clearly blurred the line between reality and...comic book.

GUS:
The kidnapper still has one more person to snatch. And it appears he's targeting anyone involved
in this bribery scam. (cell phone rings)

SHAWN:
Talia. Talia has to be the next victim. We need to get the real police in here.

GUS:
(answers phone) Hello? Uh, hello, Mr. Takei, what can I do for you? Just name it.
(listens) Hold on. (to SHAWN) It's for you.

SHAWN:
(takes phone) G-Dog. What's up, handsome? Beatrice? I canned her. Yeah, she's out of
here. Tonight? Absolutely, sir. I'll meet you there. (ends call) Huh.

GUS:
What? What's happening?

SHAWN:
Karaoke with George later.

GUS:
Get out of here. This is a Trek fan's dream come true.

SHAWN:
Hmm. Awkward.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
He sort of just invited me. You know what? Call him back, tell him I said we need you for all
the high harmonies. (gives GUS his phone back before walking off)

GUS:
(follows SHAWN) This is messed up, Shawn.

SHAWN:
No, this is messed up. (picks at pastry) This isn't a churro. This is... I don't know
what this is.

INT. HOSPITAL, DELIVERY ROOM, DAY

VICK is sitting on the bed and two nurses are monitoring her. LASSITER enters.

LASSITER:
Okay, finally got a hold of your husband. He's on his way, but apparently traffic is a nightmare.

VICK:
Thank you, Carlton.

DOCTOR:
Everything's looking really good. You just relax.

LASSITER:
I'm going to go now and let you...

VICK:
(rubs side) No, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Don't... Don't go.

LASSITER:
You want me to stay?

VICK:
Yeah. In class, I always had a coach. So, just stand here and keep your eyes north of the equator.

LASSITER:
Yeah, that won't be a problem. (removes jacket)

DOCTOR:
You ready for your epidural?

VICK:
No, thank you. I'm going to do this naturally.

DOCTOR:
Okay. We'll hold off, then.

A nurse helps LASSITER into scrubs.

VICK:
Mmm-hmm.

LASSITER:
Are you insane?

VICK:
I don't need it.

LASSITER:
Listen, I would put myself on a morphine pump if I were going to push eleven pounds of limbs and
elbows out of...

VICK:
(cuts him off) I've made my decision.

LASSITER:
And I admire you for it.

INT. CONVENTION CENTER, MAIN HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are walking through the booth area.

SHAWN:
Have you considered this? Maybe the whole thing is a stunt.

GUS:
What do you mean?

SHAWN:
You know, to promote the movie. The whole scenario is just so fantastical. It's like a plot to a
comic book. Dent could have arranged it, maybe Talia. It could have been all three of them. It's
just so theatrical with the cryptic notes.

JULIET finds them.

JULIET:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
Hi.

JULIET:
Hi. Gus said you've seen the kidnapper.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) You told her that?

GUS:
We needed her.

JULIET:
Can you give me a description?

SHAWN:
(to GUS) You can't tell her I've seen the kidnapper when I didn't see the kidnapper.
(to JULIET) I didn't see the kidnapper.

JULIET:
You didn't?

SHAWN:
I saw through the kidnapper's eyes. He was stalking his next victim. It was a woman.

SHAWN puts a hand to his temples as if having another vision and reaches his other hand to
GUS' head.

GUS:
(ducks away) Shawn.

SHAWN:
Talia. It's Talia.

JULIET:
Wait. The woman you discovered the second note with is the third victim?

SHAWN:
Quite possibly. Or she could be the kidnapper.

GUS:
So, what, she's kidnapping herself?

SHAWN:
Or the second victim is the kidnapper and he was just pretending to get kidnapped.

JULIET:
Guys, I just saw her. She's outside on the phone.

SHAWN:
Man.

They rush outside.

EXT. CONVENTION CENTER, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and JULIET emerge from the front door.

SHAWN:
Where did you see her last?

JULIET:
(points) Over there.

SHAWN sees something and runs over. TALIA'S cellphone is on the ground.

SHAWN:
Oh, man. (sees the number) "9-1..." Uh-oh.

GUS:
What? No note?

SHAWN:
(sees a paper stuck to the heel of a woman's shoe) Wait a minute.(follows after the
costumed woman) Excuse me. (kneels down and grabs the woman's leg, lifting her foot to
remove the paper) Thank you. (reads note) "Judgment day." (stands and shows GUS
and JULIET the note) Looks like Talia's joined Malone and Dent in missing-persons land.

INT. CONVENTION CENTER, ENTRANCE HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stand to the side as uniformed police rush into the building.

SHAWN:
Judgment day? It sounds bad. That's, like, the day that you're judged.

GUS:
In T2 it was the end of mankind. (opens comic) Though I doubt our kidnapper has
first-strike nuclear capabilities.

SHAWN:
Ooh! (sees something and walks off)

He sees a bowl of Cheese Doodles and takes a bite of one.

GUS:
What the hell are you doing?

SHAWN:
Running makes me hungry. You know that.

GUS:
You don't know where those have been. They could have bird flu on them or something.

SHAWN:
Bird flu. Wow. Look at you. How can you read a comic book at a time like this?

GUS:
First of all, I can read a comic anytime. And secondly, Juliet has almost the entire police
force inside there. They'll find Talia and the others.

SHAWN:
Dude, whatever this crazy person has planned for these people, he's going to do it soon. He has
all his victims. We need to figure out who stands to gain from the disappearance of those three
and who would want the Red Phantom movie to tank this badly.

GUS:
Why don't you ask your friend, George Takei?

SHAWN:
I would. But once he starts singing Afternoon Delight, he just goes to another place.

GUS:
(looking at comic) Shawn?

SHAWN:
Juliet didn't find anything at the latest crime scene to help?

GUS:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
No forensics on the note?

GUS:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
(shows a panel in the comic) Look. It's the same as the note in Malone's room.

SHAWN:
Somebody's recreating the crime from this comic book. What happens in this thing?

GUS:
A supervillain named Fear Career, he kidnaps the judge, prosecutor and defense attorney he felt
locked him up years ago.

SHAWN:
Fear Career. Awesome. Then what?

GUS:
He sets them on fire.

SHAWN:
He sets them on fire?

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Give me that. (grabs the comic from GUS)

GUS:
What the hell are you doing?

SHAWN:
Looking for clues. (thumbs through with fingers covered by orange cheese powder)

GUS:
You're ruining a first printing near-mint work of art. I've been looking for that comic for five
years now.

SHAWN:
Gus, lives are at stake.

GUS:
The kidnapper must be some kind of deranged fan.

SHAWN:
(stops and stares) Deranged? Yes. Fan? I'm not so sure. (rips cover off comic and
walks away)

GUS:
Wait, what? What the... You're buying me another one. First printing! (follows SHAWN)

INT. HOSPITAL, DELIVERY ROOM, DAY

VICK groans as she tries to push.

DOCTOR:
She's not focusing. Can you help motivate her a little bit?

LASSITER:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Motivation was my thing at the academy. (leans over VICK and shouts)
All right, now you listen to me, it's time to squeeze this puppy out. So, when I say push, I
want you to push, you understand me? Push! Push! Push!

VICK:
(shouts back) Yeah, that's not really working for me right now!

LASSITER:
Fine, I was just giving it a shot! Um, okay, okay. (moves in closer and puts his hands around
VICK'S head in an attempt to comfort) Just, just remain calm. Everything's going to be fine.

VICK:
Uh, yeah. I don't need that either. (pushes him away)

LASSITER:
I don't know what you want then. I don't know what any woman wants.

VICK:
Just give me your hand and shut the hell up.

DOCTOR:
It's crowning. Here we go. Here we go.

VICK screams. LASSITER looks on in amazement.

DOCTOR:
It's a girl.

The baby cries. Vick sighs in relief.

LASSITER:
We did it.

DOCTOR:
Want to cut the cord, Dad?

LASSITER:
No, I'm not the...Yeah, okay.

LASSITER cuts the cord as VICK watches. The DOCTOR then hands him the baby.

LASSITER:
Oh, oh, you're going to...Oh! Hi, there. (gently rocks the baby) Nice to meet you.
Children are one of the reasons my wife and I split up. She didn't think I wanted any. She was
wrong.

VICK:
Yeah, that's great, Carlton. You think I might hold my baby now?

LASSITER:
(reluctantly hands over baby) Of course.

INT. CONVENTION CENTER, MAIN HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS search the room.

SHAWN:
We need to find Juliet fast.

GUS:
She's in plain clothes. She could be anywhere in this place. It's like looking for a needle in a
haystack.

SHAWN:
(sees something and stops) I know how I can get her attention. (heads off)

GUS:
Shawn! Will you stop going up there?

SHAWN:
(turns around at the base of the stage) Sorry. Judgment day. Got to do it.

Off to the side, George TAKEI is waiting for his introduction.

COORDINATOR: (over microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, George... Uh, okay, okay.

SHAWN comes up to the podium.

COORDINATOR: (over microphone)
Please welcome back to the stage psychic Shawn Spencer!

The crowd applauds as SHAWN holds up his hands.

SHAWN: (over microphone)
(after a few exaggerated poses, places hands on temples) I'm sensing something. Something
strong. A spirit. A disturbed spirit.

As GUS walks past, George TAKEI grabs him by the arm.

TAKEI:
Why is my assistant up there?

GUS:
Maybe he's setting up a karaoke machine for your duet, Chekov.

TAKEI:
Sulu, damn it!

SHAWN: (over microphone)
It's getting clear now. It's a kidnapping spirit responsible for crimes committed right here at
the con! (crowd murmurs) I need help. I must call upon the powers of Magic Head!
(motions to GUS)

CROWD:
(chants) Magic Head! Magic Head! Magic Head! Magic Head! Magic Head!

TAKEI:
Who's Magic Head?

Resigned, GUS walks onstage.

TAKEI:
Where are you going?

The crowd breaks into applause when GUS arrives. He waves, embarrassed. SHAWN makes a big
show of laying his hand on GUS' head. GUS glares at SHAWN but lets him do it.

SHAWN: (over microphone)
I can see it now.

Uniformed officers take up places along the aisles. JULIET finds a spot in the crowd.

SHAWN: (over microphone)
It is a vengeful spirit and there is a color. The color is green. It is the Green Spirit.
(walks to front of stage) The kidnapper is the creator of The Green Spirit, Hiltz Kooler.

The crowd parts, making a clear path to KOOLER'S booth.

SHAWN: (over microphone)
Ah, yes, you had motive, didn't you? The studio execs bastardized your beloved Green Spirit and
turned him into a pop culture punch line. You hated Malone, the Malcontent, because it was his
tidal wave of bad buzz that sunk your flick. You were on the brink of becoming a mogul. But then
it all slipped away. Now you're reduced to cursing nipples and signing autographs at
conventions. Like a classic supervillain, you were driven mad by revenge. (scene cuts of what
SHAWN describes) You read Malone's blogs, looking for clues to his true identity. Then, one
day, like manna from heaven, The Malcontent blogged he was coming here. You also read the execs
who had screwed your character would be here, too. All the people that wronged you in the same
place at the same time. The opportunity was too good to pass up. And you could hide your
identity by wearing a costume. And every time you snatched one of your victims, you left a note
just like Fear Career in your comic. (present) Yes, people! This was written by a
criminal. There is malice in the ink. I can see it now. Hiltz always had a very distinctive way
of writing the letter "O." (flashes of the comic, the notes and the autograph) It has the
swirl. (holds up the ripped page from the comic bearing the autograph) I'm sure if the
police analyzed this autograph, they'll see the handwriting is an exact match for the
kidnapper's threatening notes.

The crowd applauds as the police move in.

TAKEI:
(disgusted) It's the same thing that happened in San Antonio.

JULIET grabs a handcuffed KOOLER by the arm.

JULIET:
Where are your victims?

KOOLER:
My plan is already in motion and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

As JULIET leads KOOLER past them, SHAWN remembers that KOOLER is recreating the crime from
the comic.

SHAWN:
They're near fire.

SHAWN remembers TALIA talking about pyrotechnics. He then sees blue sparkles/sequins on
KOOLER'S shoulder. He then sees the decorative bunting along the front of the stage.

SHAWN:
Under the stage.

INT. CONVENTION CENTER, UNDER STAGE, DAY

JULIET goes down with a flashlight and sees the explosives

JULIET:
Oh, down here.

Uniformed officers join her and she sees the victims bound and gagged behind the
pyrotechnics.

JULIET:
They're here. All of them. Look, don't worry, everything's going to be just fine, okay? We're
going to get you out of here. Guys.

JULIET backs out of the way and lets the uniforms disconnect the fireworks.

INT. HOSPITAL, NURSERY, DAY

JULIET and GUS are framed by one window waving at the babies.

GUS:
Hi. Hi.

LASSITER and SHAWN are framed by a second window.

SHAWN:
So, after I collared the villain and saved the girl, Jules grabbed the others and everyone
hoisted me on their shoulders, carried me to the car chanting my name. It was awesome. Oh, but
your story about cutting the cord was good, too. Lot of drama, suspense, twist ending that I
don't think any of us saw coming.

JULIET:
At which point did you faint?

LASSITER:
I did not faint. I was merely resting my eyes momentarily and fell slightly backwards.

SHAWN:
Hey, I don't know if it makes a difference. I think you're a hero.

JULIET:
Which one is hers?

GUS:
I don't know. Lassiter, you cut the cord.

LASSITER:
Well, they all look alike. Is there one that poops a lot? I know. Let's ask our psychic.

SHAWN:
You know what, guys, this is weird, I'm not getting anything. I think one of these babies might
be evil, blocking my abilities to communicate. Damien?

VICK walks up behind SHAWN.

VICK:
Come on. Isn't it obvious? She looks exactly like me. (waves) Hi.

JULIET:
Chief, should you be up and walking?

VICK:
Walking? I'm coming into work tomorrow.

SHAWN:
No, don't be ridiculous. You need to go home with your child. Relax. Take a load off. Refresh
yourself. January, I think January. Come back in January.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

GUS and HENRY are sitting at the kitchen table when SHAWN comes in the back door, smiling.
He's holding two large poster boards(?) behind his back.

SHAWN:
So glad you both could make it.

HENRY:
Make it? I live here.

GUS:
What's that behind your back, Shawn?

SHAWN:
I dropped back by the con.

GUS:
You went back without me?

SHAWN:
Those people, good people, good hearts. You were right from the beginning, Gus. And I didn't
want to ruin the surprise. Introducing, Tranya Independent Comics' latest limited-edition one-
shot...

SHAWN pulls out a comic cover of a man in purple and yellow spandex with his hands to his
head with "waves" emanating from his head.

SHAWN:
Surprise.

GUS:
(reads) "Follow the adventures of Psych-Man as he uses his bizarre mental powers to foil
criminal plots with his sidekick Magic Head."

SHAWN:
And bam!

SHAWN pulls out the second poster to reveal what looks to be a midget with a large top hat.
The head dwarfs the body. He is holding a magic wand. HENRY snickers.

GUS:
What's that supposed to be?

SHAWN:
Dude, it's Magic Head! It's like looking in a mirror.

GUS:
Why would I need a wand when I have a magic head?

SHAWN:
It's a ceremonial thing. It's, it's just... It's representative. You don't actually use the
wand.

GUS:
Stupid. (drinks his beer)

SHAWN:
I think it's dope. Now, who wants an autograph?

Episode 1x10 From the Earth to the Starbucks

1987

INT. GROCERY STORE, DAY

SHAWN is at the checkout wanting to buy candy bars. HENRY behind him looking through a magazine.

SHAWN:
I need 80 cents.

HENRY:
No, you don't. You need to put back two of those extra candy bars that you just picked up.

SHAWN:
Dad, you don't understand. I can't put back one of these. That'd be like saying that one of these candy bars is less worthy than the others. And I can't play those kinds of favorites.

HENRY:
All right, fine enjoy your dilemma. In the meantime, don't drag Gus into it.

GUS:
Thanks, Mr. Spencer.

HENRY:
No problem.

SHAWN:
Switch places with me.

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Why not?

GUS:
Because then you'll try to take whatever money I have left.

SHAWN:
And when have I tried to do that to you?

GUS:
Wednesday and Saturday.

HENRY:
Monday.

SHAWN:
Gosh, you guys have scary memories.

CASHIER:
Next in line, please?

SHAWN:
That's you. (pulls GUS by the arm)

GUS:
No...

HENRY:
Shawn, come on, that's you.

SHAWN pushes the candy bars forward on the belt towards the scanner.

CASHIER:
Okay, so, all of these? (scans the candy and lights begin to flash and an alarm blares) Oh, my gosh, it happened here? The one millionth customer!

SHAWN:
I'm sorry.

CASHIER:
Don't be sorry, kid, you won!

HENRY:
He won? Won what?

CASHIER:
All kinds of things. Gift certificates, that cool bike up there. (makes announcement) Ladies and gentlemen, we have it! Our one millionth customer!

SHAWN:
Can I use one of my gift certificates now?

CASHIER:
Sure.

SHAWN:
Cool! (grabs boxes of candy from the rack) Isn't this cool, Gus? How lucky am I?

TWENTY CHARMED YEARS LATER...

INT. TOM BLAIR'S PUB, NIGHT

SHAWN walks into the bar with a young woman, AMANDA.

AMANDA:
Thanks for doing this.

SHAWN:
Oh, don't be silly. Are you kidding? Go out spur of the moment with a sexy gal who likes quirky dive bars as a starting point but then is also open to see where the night goes.

AMANDA:
(sits) You could've thought I was weird, asking you out just as you walked by my counter.

SHAWN:
I don't call that weird. I call that blind, dumb, stupid, awe-inspired luck.

AMANDA'S cell phone rings and she checks the screen before pressing ignore.

SHAWN:
I'm going to get drinks. Two vodka sodas? (sits opposite AMANDA)

AMANDA:
I've just decided I am going to experience life, you know, try new things. I signed up for a painting class today.

SHAWN:
You know, they make paint you can eat now.

AMANDA:
And I'm giving new focus to my job.

SHAWN sees her heart-shaped pendant necklace.

AMANDA:
So...

SHAWN:
Can I ask you a question?

AMANDA:
Anything.

SHAWN:
Did you just get out of a relationship?

AMANDA:
How did you know?

SHAWN:
Just a wild guess. Was it, uh... today?

AMANDA:
Yesterday.

SHAWN:
Are you sure you should be out dating already?

AMANDA:
Yes, of course. He was... cheating on me.

SHAWN:
Cheating?

AMANDA:
Yeah, and the stupid thing is, I thought everything was going really well, you know, and then he just started getting all weird the last month... lying, going through my stuff, my address book, my jewelry. Finally, Friday, he tells me he's going to watch the game at a friend's. A co-worker of mine spots him over the Eastland center. He may not accept it yet, but we are definitely finished.

The waitress brings the drinks.

SHAWN:
Thank you.

AMANDA:
I hope you don't mind being a rebound.

SHAWN:
Oh, I usually prefer it, but not in this case.

AMANDA:
Why not?

SHAWN:
Primarily because he's not cheating on you. (sips drink) Look, he took your jewelry because he's trying to figure out your ring size. He took you to Tiffany's to buy that fancy necklace because he's really trying to scout out what kind of stones and settings you like.

AMANDA:
What about last Friday?

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, the Eastland center? There's no bars or clubs there. He wasn't there with a chick. He was probably on the north side of the parking lot at Robbins Brothers picking out the ring.

AMANDA:
My address book?

SHAWN:
He called your parents to ask for your hand. He's doing it right.

AMANDA:
Do you think I should call him?

SHAWN:
I'll let you be the psychic on that one.

AMANDA opens her phone and speed dials her boyfriend. SHAWN sips his drink.

AMANDA:
Ray? Yeah, I need you to tell me the truth. If you lie to me, we will never speak again, do you understand? (holds up a finger to SHAWN and walks away) About Friday, who were you with?

SHAWN:
Take your time.

SHAWN stands and walks around with his drink. Alone at one of the tables he sees LASSITER who is resting his head on one of his arms.

SHAWN:
Lassie?

LASSITER:
(looks up) Spencer! Why am I surprised?

SHAWN:
(walks over) Why are you wasted?

LASSITER:
Hey, do you like scotch? Miss? Can I get two more of these, please? Thank you.

SHAWN mouths "One more" and leans on the railing.

LASSITER:
Listen, there is something I have got to get off my chest.

SHAWN:
Is it your shirt? Please say no.

LASSITER:
You... astound me.

SHAWN:
Come again?

LASSITER:
It's beyond astounding. It is some of the most impressive reasoning I've ever seen.

SHAWN:
Is there a punch line coming? Let's get to it.

LASSITER:
I don't know how you do it. I mean, it's not psychic...ness, we both know that's a crock of crap, But you, sir, are unstoppable, guaranteed arrest.(drinks scotch)

SHAWN:
What's happening here?

LASSITER:
Can I tell you a secret?

SHAWN:
I wouldn't recommend it, no.

LASSITER:
(walks around to sit in the closer chair) You know how everyone thinks my wife and I have been separated for nine months?

SHAWN:
Yes?

LASSITER:
Two years. Two years tonight, and I'm the one that keeps trying to fix the thing. (leans back for his drink and almost falls off the stool)



SHAWN:
(grabs LASSITER'S arm and pulls him back) Jeez.

LASSITER:
I mean, counselling, therapy, acupuncture, you name it. I have tried to try to try it.

SHAWN:
Well... I'm going to let you go. Don't drive.

LASSITER:
You know, I used to be a good cop. Seriously. Stunning arrest record. It was one of the best in the department. I caught the Back Bay Killer.

SHAWN:
Yes, you did. I remember it well.

LASSITER:
Although I had a tip.

SHAWN:
The blue sedan.

LASSITER:
Yeah. (realizes) That was you?

SHAWN:
It... might have been.

LASSITER:
See what I mean?

SHAWN:
Come on, you still had to put it all together right? (moves around to sit at the table)

LASSITER:
Look, Spencer, the blue sedan was the key to the whole thing. It was the murder's car.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but who had to run the plates? And all those numbers and letters could have confused many a cop.

LASSITER:
Spencer, stop, okay? I am done. Here, I want you to have these. (holds up handcuffs) I don't need them. I am over. (puts cuffs on the table)

SHAWN:
All right, just stop this. This is nonsense. You're not over. Look, you're a striking man with strong features, eyes that women want to do...cannonballs into. You have great posture, and penmanship the likes I've never seen.

LASSITER:
No, I have officially hit rock bottom. A month ago, I got this case, right? A healthy 42-year-old astronomer dies. Doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, spends all day in an ergonomically designed chair charting the night sky. Natural causes, that's what the coroner comes back with. Does a full autopsy. No red flags. Nothing. I know he was murdered. I just can't... (motions with his hand like he's grabbing something)

SHAWN:
What? What is this? (mimics the hand motion)

LASSITER:
Prove it. The department won't even let me pursue it.

SHAWN:
Come on, you'll figure it out.

LASSITER:
No, I won't. I can't, and I've accepted that.

SHAWN:
All right, look, Lassie... (tries to get a word out) Carlton. I believe in you. I really do. You just... you've just got to trust your instincts.

AMANDA shrieks and comes over to SHAWN, laughing.

AMANDA:
I just got engaged!

SHAWN:
(stands) Oh, my God!

AMANDA:
Thank you! (hugs SHAWN) Thank you! Thank you!

AMANDA screams and SHAWN gives a "sympathy" scream.

AMANDA:
I got engaged! (runs off with a laugh)

SHAWN:
(claps) I'll never, ever see you again. Bye. (turns around) Stick with it, Lassie. You... (LASSITER has passed out and fallen to the floor) You can solve this thing. You're halfway there already.

INT SBPD, LOWER LEVEL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are picking up a paycheck when SHAWN sees LASSITER.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Check this out. (goes after LASSITER)

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(follows LASSITER up stairs) Hey, Lassie.

LASSITER:
What is it Spencer?

SHAWN:
How you doing? You okay?

INT SBPD, MAIN LEVEL, DAY

LASSITER:
All right... I'll bite. What's the joke?

SHAWN:
Just wanted to make sure you got home all right last night.

LASSITER:
From what?

SHAWN:
From the bar.

LASSITER:
What bar?

JULIET:
(joins them) You were at a bar?

LASSITER:
No, I wasn't at a bar. I don't drink.

JULIET:
You don't drink?

INT SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER:
Well, okay. Wine at weddings. (puts coffee on desk and removes jacket) An occasional snifter of brandy. Maybe a good single-Malt scotch. (hangs up jacket)

GUS:
Sounds like drinking to me.

LASSITER:
Spencer, stop making up stories, okay? They're obviously bogus.

SHAWN:
Okay, so, you were not at Tom Blair's pub last night?

LASSITER:
I don't even know who Tom Blair is.

SHAWN:
Mmm-hmm. And how'd you get that sweet bruise on your forehead?

LASSITER:
I had an altercation.

SHAWN:
Yes, with a table.

LASSITER:
With a suspect. If we're done, I would really like to move on with my day.

SHAWN:
I get it. Yesterday was a... a tough anniversary for you.

LASSITER:
What? Who have you been talking to?

SHAWN:
Nobody. I'll get out of your hair. (leaves)

INT SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN:
Okay. We gotta solve that case.

GUS:
What case?

SHAWN:
The one Lassiter can't solve.

GUS:
He's going to hire us for a case?

SHAWN:
Oh, God, no, he'd never do that.

GUS:
So we won't get paid?

SHAWN:
Exactly.

GUS:
And we're just doing it for the glory?

SHAWN:
Nope. We give Lassiter all the credit. In fact, I don't even think he can know we're helping him.

GUS:
(stops walking) Dude, that's a good idea, Shawn. I ditch out of work on the day we release three new products to spend time on an unsolvable case in which we won't get paid, and someone else gets all the credit.

SHAWN:
That quite honestly is some of the best nut-shelling I've ever heard.

GUS:
We made a deal. Yesterday. We're equal partners. That means we collectively decide which appointments to make, which cases to take. We have to live by that, At least for a day. Especially today.

SHAWN:
You're right.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
That's going to be a problem, though.

GUS:
Why?

SHAWN:
Because we've already got a meeting with the dead guy's widow.

GUS:
When?

SHAWN:
10 minutes.

GUS:
10 minutes?

SHAWN:
Look, don't worry. I'm going to do it in the chief's office. I just need you to stand guard at the door, make sure no one catches us in there. It's going to double the excitement. Maybe triple it. (holds out fist) Now, come on, who's in? (GUS refuses to fist bump) Don't fool around. You know I can't hold my hand like this for very long. Gus, I get very poor circulation to the limbic regions. (GUS walks away) Now my pinky's going numb.

INT SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is sitting behind VICK'S desk looking attentive as he listens to the widow, MARY.

MARY:
I guess everything started to change at the beginning of last summer. He partnered with his old friend, Hugo, and they finally got accepted for eight months on the new digital telescope at the space center. Everything was normal for two weeks, and then, suddenly, Bryant started to work really long hours.

SHAWN:
I see. (picks up decorative glass fish) What do you think of this?

MARY:
I like it.

SHAWN:
It's a gift from a friend. He's a glass-blower. (sets down fish) Would you say that's when he started feeling sick, Mary?

MARY:
Not sick, just a little off. Oh, we did cancel our 4th of July trip, so I guess it was around that time. I'm sorry, something is really bugging me. Your name is Lassiter too?

SHAWN:
Yes, that's correct. Carlton Lassiter.

MARY:
But you're not affiliated with the detective Carlton Lassiter who I met before?

SHAWN:
Not in any way, shape, or form. Different department. Matter of fact, I spell mine with a "k." Two of them. Mary, is there anything you're...leaving out? (stands and walks to front of desk) Maybe something that's...slipped your mind? Something you're not telling me because it may embarrassed and/or shame you? It could be vital.

MARY:
I know this probably isn't true, but I started to suspect that he...

SHAWN:
Was cheating on you?

MARY:
Well, yes. How did you know?

SHAWN:
A shot in the dark.

MARY:
The long hours. He was consumed with his work. He was different. Distant. I don't even like to say it out loud.

SHAWN:
Please, don't.

MARY:
Bryant wasn't really the type. We were planning a future. He wanted to try for a baby. He was a good man.

INT SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and MARY exit VICK'S office.

SHAWN:
Thanks again for coming in, Mary.

MARY:
No problem, Kkarlton.

SHAWN:
If we uncover any...

JULIET comes up behind them.

JULIET:
Carlton?

SHAWN:
Yes, Karlton, with a "k".

MARY:
Two "k"s.

SHAWN:
The second one is silent.

JULIET:
May I speak to you privately in your office, Kkarlton?

SHAWN:
Certainly. (to MARY) We'll be in touch.

MARY:
Thanks.

SHAWN follows JULIET into VICK'S office.

INT SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

JULIET:
What are you doing reopening the Vallery case?

SHAWN:
Reopening? Come on, that word has so many syllables.

JULIET:
That case was determined not to be a case, despite detective Lassiter's best efforts. (SHAWN slaps her outstretched hand)  Shawn! Now, I need a whole lot of an explanation from you, because although you do make me laugh occasionally, impersonating an officer...

SHAWN:
Impersonating an officer? Please. I told that woman I was in accounts payable.

JULIET:
Shawn, come clean.

SHAWN:
I would like to solve this case for Lassiter.

JULIET:
He'll never allow it.

SHAWN:
That's why he can't know I'm involved. I figure I can guide him through this thing, right? Build him up, get him back on his feet again.

JULIET:
You're serious?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

JULIET:
Why?

SHAWN:
I just feel like he really needs this. I mean, look at him.

JULIET:
Okay, I'm in.

SHAWN:
You're what?

JULIET:
What do you got?

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS walks in with his sample case. SHAWN is sitting at his desk on his cell.

SHAWN:
My dad is not answering his phone.

GUS:
So?

SHAWN:
So he's always home, and he always answers his phone after two rings. This is actually somewhat troubling.

GUS:
Why?

SHAWN:
"Why"? Fish Derby's on.

GUS:
What is this?

SHAWN:
It's the Bryant Vallery case.

GUS:
The one from this morning?

SHAWN:
And the rest of the week. I predict we will solve it Friday at 10:01 pm, and then maybe watch some cable. (leans back in the chair and puts his feet on the desk)

GUS:
Sounds great. And did you find a partner that's willing to do this with you?

SHAWN:
Jules is in. My dad is clearly missing, or something. Dude, that leaves you! Gus, you get to step up in a big fat way.

GUS:
You have one job. I have two jobs, Shawn. I have presentations to memorize on three new drugs. And while you were out drinking last night and taking on free cases, I was up half the night dreaming about whether the gelcaps are more effective than the tablets.

SHAWN:
First of all, tablets. Always tablets, that's a given. Secondly, I've been having this reoccurring dream where I'm flying over Auckland on the back of a swan made primarily of cocoa. His name is Clem. But your dream was... pretty interesting too. And thirdly, I guarantee you that after you hear this reason, you will definitely want to take this case.

GUS:
I doubt it, but, give it a shot.

SHAWN:
The victim was an astronomer. Yeah. The guy died while he was working the night sky at the observatory.

GUS:
(chuckles nervously) What would make you think that would matter?

SHAWN:
Oh, come on. I know you go down to the Space Center.

GUS:
That's preposterous, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Thursdays.

GUS:
I'm never there...

SHAWN:
In the afternoon, around 2:00.

GUS:
Have you been following me?

SHAWN:
Maybe. Sometimes.

Frustrated, GUS walks away.

SHAWN:
To sharpen and refine my tailing skills, yes.

GUS:
(walks around and points angrily at SHAWN) This is exactly the sort of thing I was talking about, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Okay, I apologize, Gus, I do, but it's all good. So you like astronomy. I accept that.

GUS:
This conversation is over. (points at SHAWN'S face before walking back behind his desk)

SHAWN:
Okay, don't go all Vincent Gallo on me. We're just getting started, man. Look, some guy dies at a space center that you frequently sneak off to? We got to get down there, and we got to do some serious space-digging.

GUS:
No, we don't. (walks back around and points again) As a matter of fact, now that I know you're tailing me while I'm at work, get ready to get lost in my dust.

SHAWN:
Okay, dust? What are you, going off-roading?

GUS:
I'm going to be un-catchable, like a jackal.

SHAWN:
Like a jackal? How about I just tail you to the observatory?

GUS:
Consider me stealth, Shawn. (move his head side-to-side)

SHAWN:
Dude, that's weird. It's like you're... like you're a bobble-head.

EXT. SPACE CENTER, PARKING LOT, DAY

GUS drives the Echo in the practically-empty lot, zig-zagging until he pulls into a spot. He steps out of the car, keeping low. He sticks his head up above the roof of the car and looks around before walking in a crouch towards the main entrance.

INT. SPACE CENTER, LOBBY ENTRANCE, DAY

GUS enters the main door and looks back to make sure he wasn't followed. He backs up to the reception desk and talks to the man behind the desk.

GUS:
Excuse me, I have an annual pass...

The man turns around and we see it is SHAWN wearing a blue flight-suit that is the uniform for the employees. He is holding a clipboard and wearing a headset.

SHAWN:
(gasps) Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Didn't see you standing there, you know, being so stealth-like. (picks up phone and uses the intercom) The jackal has arrived. (hangs up phone)

INT. SPACE CENTER, EXHIBIT HALLS, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk through the center.

GUS:
What are you doing, Shawn?

SHAWN:
What are we doing? Dude, we're undercover.

GUS:
We aren't undercover.

SHAWN:
Sure we are. I'm the employee, you're the customer.

GUS:
I am the customer.

SHAWN:
See, you're already in character, like Don Cheadle.

GUS:
I'm not involved with this case.

SHAWN:
I only need you for a minute, like when Kenickie needed Danny Zuko, and you get to be Travolta in the analogy. Tomorrow they're training me on the motion simulator. Tell me you've never wanted to take a ride on one of those things buck naked.

They stop walking.

GUS:
No, I haven't.

SHAWN:
Sure you have.

GUS:
I'm only here for a few minutes anyway.

GUS looks past SHAWN and sees a pretty woman accepting a cup of coffee from an older man. SHAWN doesn't notice.

SHAWN:
That's all I need. Look, there's this creepy janitor that lurks about. I want you to distract him while I grill planetarium girl. (turns and starts for the woman)

GUS:
(grabs SHAWN'S arm) You are not grilling Jessica. She's just interning here till she gets her college units.

SHAWN:
Jessica?

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
How do you know her name is... (gasps) Oh, Gus...

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
You haven't been coming here on Thursdays to study the stars. You've been coming here for her! Do you love her?

GUS:
Shut up, Shawn.

SHAWN:
You're in love with her.

GUS:
Shut up, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Come on I'll hook you guys up. (starts to walk away)

GUS:
(grabs SHAWN'S arm) No, Shawn!

SHAWN:
She is my co-worker, and I have the inside track.

GUS:
Listen, there are ways to go about doing this. You don't just walk up to somebody at their place and start working them over. You got to have a plan.

SHAWN:
Do you have a plan?

GUS:
Of course I have a plan.

SHAWN:
Would you mind cluing me in, please?

GUS:
All right, listen. (pulls SHAWN aside) She's been through a lot lately. She just...

SHAWN:
Broke up with her boyfriend.

GUS:
How did you know that?

SHAWN:
It's my curse, apparently.

GUS:
Well, since she's just off a break-up, I got to move gradually.

SHAWN:
Just go over there and ask her out. Get her digits.

GUS:
Shawn, this is a quality girl. That means I've got to put in quality time, okay? Oh, here she comes. Act natural.

SHAWN leans against a pole and GUS strikes a "model" pose as JESSICA walks past.

SHAWN:
Hey, Jessie, do you know Gus?

JESSICA:
(stops) Yes. Gus is a regular.

GUS:
(walks over to JESSICA) That's right.

SHAWN:
You know, I went to high school with him. Of course, I didn't hang out with cool kids like Gus in high school. He was a CIF wrestling champion back then.

JESSICA:
Really?

SHAWN:
True as toast. And in college, he was a Heisman candidate until he blew his knee out.

GUS hits SHAWN'S arm with his "discreetly".

SHAWN:
Don't act all surprised. We were all following you in the newspapers, man.

JESSICA:
You're kidding.

GUS:
Well, he is, actually.

SHAWN:
I don't kid, ever. I idolized this guy. Coolest dude I have ever known.

JESSICA:
Wow, Gus, it seems there's a lot I don't know about you.

GUS:
Well, there is...

SHAWN:
Yeah, you guys should totally talk, you know? Share stuff and whatnot. But don't let this guy grill you too much.

SHAWN forces a fake laugh and GUS joins in.

JESSICA:
Yeah, well, I'd love to, but I have to start the planetarium show.

GUS:
Yeah, she has a planetarium show to start.

SHAWN:
Oh, can I do that?

JESSICA:
Have you been trained on the show?

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, I just did the checklist like an hour ago. Perfect score. Uh... (leans over to whisper confidentially) question 18 has a typo.(straightens)

JESSICA:
Okay, great. Go ahead, then.

SHAWN:
Are you serious? Oh, this is great!

GUS:
Great.

SHAWN:
All right, I got it. No worries. No worries. I got it. (runs off)

GUS:
Thanks, Shawn. That guy. You heard about Pluto? That's messed up, right?

JESSICA:
Mmm-hmm.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER is sitting morosely at his desk, absent-mindedly clicking a pen against his head. JULIET approaches him with a file and sets it on his desk.

JULIET:
Here's the Bryant Vallery file.

LASSITER:
The what? Wait... The astronomer?

JULIET:
Yes, and I just finished the follow-Up with Mary, the widow.

LASSITER:
You what?

JULIET:
You asked me to.

LASSITER:
I did?

JULIET:
It was in passing, and wow, did it ever pay off. You were right about the affair.

LASSITER:
I was?

JULIET:
Yeah, the wife totally suspected it.

LASSITER:
She what?

JULIET:
That he potentially was having an affair. (walks away)

LASSITER:
(re-invigorated) Well, isn't that interesting? (stands) I want to re-interview everybody, and give me a copy of the coroner's report. I told you there was more to this case.

INT. SPACE CENTER, PLANETARIUM, DAY

SHAWN stands at the podium and introduces the show.

SHAWN:
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. I will be your narrator. My name is Aurora Borealis.

The "creepy" janitor, VERNON STALLINGS is there watching.

SHAWN:
There are over four hundred stars in our galaxy. Maybe more. No one knows for sure. Many have said that the universe is even larger than the Indian Ocean, and that is why it is called "infinitum staroctopussium." Ah, yes... our glorious constellations. There they all are, take a look. Over here, we have... one with a guy... holding... some sort of thing. Over here, our beloved Olympic rings, all seven of them. And here... here's one with a fish.

STALLINGS walks up to SHAWN.

STALLINGS:
You gotta name 'em.

SHAWN:
Notice, straight... straight above you, "The Hammer of Jeff". And over there, in the south...

STALLINGS:
(whispers) North.

SHAWN:
North, you'll see... "Monkey with Rash". The Egyptians used to set their clocks by him.

Some of the customers look at SHAWN as if he's nuts.

SHAWN:
Oh, look, there's goes an asteroid.

STALLINGS:
Comet.

SHAWN:
Comet. It's what they named that cleaning solution after. I know, it may stink when you leave it in the sink, but, boy, oh, boy, does it clean.

(to STALLINGS) Is there a reason you're standing so close to me?

STALLINGS:
Just looking.

SHAWN:
Yeah, well, that's the great thing about looking, you can do it from far, far away.

STALLINGS nods and walks away.

SHAWN:
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I implore you to enjoy the majesty of the heavens.

SHAWN watches as STALLINGS leaves with his cart. SHAWN twists the dial and speeds up the projection and the stars spin above. He then leaves the room to follow STALLINGS.

INT. SPACE CENTER, EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM, DAY

STALLINGS picks the lock on one of the lockers and proceeds to pick through the contents. SHAWN sneaks up and watches from around the corner. STALLINGS takes what he wants and tosses it into the cart before leaving. SHAWN leaves in the opposite direction.

INT. SPACE CENTER, OBSERVATORY, DAY

SHAWN enters, planning to do a little snooping, and is greeted by the astronomer, HUGO.

HUGO:
Hey!

SHAWN:
Oh!

HUGO:
You work here?

SHAWN:
No, I just, uh... I just happen to own my own space suit.

HUGO:
(laughs) A smart ass. I like that. Get over here, kid. Do me a favor. Keep your finger on this space bar while I adjust this.

SHAWN walks over and places his finger on the space-bar.

SHAWN:
Like this?

HUGO:
Uh-Huh.

SHAWN:
You're going to trust me with this?

HUGO:
I don't have a lot of other options, do I, space man?

As HUGO opens the telescope doors, SHAWN notices a tab of paper sticking out from a log book.

SHAWN:
I got to be honest. This seems like a job for two, no?

HUGO:
(makes adjustments on a different computer) Sometimes it is. But once the scope is in place, all you got to do is watch the monitor, hoping to catch things that nobody else has. You know, if you've got a partner, you can switch off, you know, rest your eyes, maybe make calculations on what you've seen, or just... break up the silence of staring into the unknown.

SHAWN:
So where's your partner?

HUGO:
(walks back to desk) That's the bad part of it. He passed away not too long ago. You know, the Buddhists have this saying about moving on, honoring the work, but I don't remember it. What I do know is that I realize I'm too old to be doing this stuff all alone. (takes over from SHAWN)

SHAWN:
(walks over to telescope) So you're, uh, you're continuing the work, huh?

HUGO:
Bryant would return from the grave if I didn't. You know, we petitioned for five years for use of this scope, and we got lucky. (sees SHAWN peering through eyepiece) No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't touch. No. I mean, once you get in here, you got to find what you're looking for
fast. We had eight months. Bryant saw six.

SHAWN:
Eight months seems like a good chunk of time.

HUGO:
Not in astronomy. See, once you find it, you got to track it. Ok, and then it's not a discovery until you chart it, and then it goes around again, and then you prove it.

SHAWN:
Must get lonely.

HUGO:
Look, I just talk. You know? I've got the gift of the gab. Jeez, I'll talk to anybody, I suppose. (sits at the desk)

SHAWN:
So you, uh, you still haven't found what you're looking for, huh?

HUGO:
No, but when I do, you'll read about it, believe me. You'll read about it.

INT. SPACE CENTER, HALL, DAY

GUS is walking with JESSICA.

JESSICA:
My real goal is to become an astronomer. See something no one else has. I don't need to make a big, flashy discovery, or name a star, or become famous, like most of these guys want.

GUS:
Yeah.

JESSICA:
All I've ever really wanted is to know I made a difference.

GUS:
That's great, knowing what you wanted to do since you were a kid. That's a gift.

JESSICA:
Thanks. You know, you're a great listener, Gus.

GUS:
Oh, well, it's easy to talk to you, Jessica. I mean...

JESSICA looks at her watch and then at the entrance to the planetarium.

GUS:
Is something wrong?

JESSICA:
They've been in there 45 minutes.

GUS:
So?

JESSICA:
It's a four minute show.

SHAWN leads the way out of the planetarium. Behind him, the patrons are dazed and dizzy. One man actually falls down, knocking over a trash can.

SHAWN:
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why time travel is not only possible, but may have already happened.

SHAWN walks past GUS and JESSICA, oblivious to the moaning people behind him. GUS chuckles nervously.

EXT. SPACE CENTER, DAY

GUS and SHAWN walk outside.

SHAWN:
So I met the other astronomer. Nice guy, chatty. Hiding something.

GUS:
Something nefarious?

SHAWN:
I don't know yet. How'd you do?

GUS:
Please, Shawn. How do you think? (reaches into pocket and pulls out a slip of paper and shows SHAWN)

SHAWN:
(gasps) Digits.

GUS:
You know this.

SHAWN:
Nice!

GUS:
We're going out tomorrow.

SHAWN:
It's all coming together, man.

GUS takes the phone number back.

SHAWN:
Juliet called. She ran our dead guy's phone records. We got to meet her at the station.

GUS:
You bet. Let's go.

SHAWN:
Whoa! Not now. 5:00.

GUS:
Why 5:00?

SHAWN:
Gus, I can't just leave willy-nilly whenever I want. I have a job to do here. (claps GUS on the shoulder and runs back inside)

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER has set up a board with crime scene photos and pertinent papers tacked up.

LASSITER:
I don't care what the coroner says. Healthy hearts do not just stop. But you know what? I've got a golf buddy who's a cardiologist. I'm going to run these by him. (grabs his jacket and heads out) Mind the store. I'll be back.

SHAWN and GUS peer out from behind a column and wait for LASSITER to leave. JULIET sees them.

JULIET:
(whispers) Hey! Okay, so we ran the home, the work, and the cell phone records of Bryant Vallery. We got nothing on the home phone, a few strange hits on the work line, but when we ran the cell phone, we hit the jackpot. We found a number that he calls only from his cell phone, all hours of the night, way too often for business. Unless it's monkey business.

SHAWN:
Sweet!

JULIET:
So we contacted the cell company for the name. The number is 555-019...well, where is it?

JULIET goes to her desk to check the file and GUS reaches into his pocket and pulls out the slip of paper with JESSICA'S number.

JULIET:
Oh, here it is. 555-019...

SHAWN:
9?

JULIET:
Wow, that's good.

SHAWN:
Not really.

INT. SPACE CENTER, EXHIBIT HALLS, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk through the center.

SHAWN:
So she had an affair with a married guy and probably lied about it. That doesn't mean she's guilty.

GUS:
Shawn, you're confusing me. You're the one who loves to jump to conclusions, and you're not even hopping toward this one?

SHAWN:
Hopping? It doesn't track, Gus. Why would she kill him?

GUS:
She broke up with a guy. It's him. He dumped her.

SHAWN:
So why doesn't she mention to you that her ex-boyfriend just bit the dust?

GUS:
What is she going to say? "Hey, how's it going? My boyfriend just died. He might have been killed, maybe it was me." (imitates girlish laughter)

SHAWN:
I doubt she chortles.

GUS:
Man, she was so damn good-looking.

SHAWN:
And she still is. Gus, even if we have a who, we don't have a clear motive, and we certainly don't have the method. We can't give up on our other suspects. What we need to do (swipes key card) is keep looking.

SHAWN opens the secure door and walks through. Gus follows.

GUS:
You're going to set off the alarm.

SHAWN:
Clearly, I have a security pass.

GUS:
They gave you a security pass?

SHAWN:
They gave Dave, the cheddar corn guy, a security pass, I merely stumbled upon it by happenstance.

GUS:
And by "happenstance", you mean...

SHAWN:
I swiped it from his gym bag while he was shaking a milky way loose from the vending machine. Dammit, I... (SHAWN tries to use the card against the door with no success)

GUS:
What are you doing, Shawn?

SHAWN:
What I don't have is a key.

STALLINGS:
That's not right.

GUS and SHAWN turn around and see the janitor had snuck up on them.

SHAWN:
What? I'm sorry. I just, I... I left my Pogo stick in there, and I just...

STALLINGS:
No, I mean you're not doing it right. You got to move upward if you want to get the latch to disengage. Let me do it.

STALLINGS walks to the door and pulls out a switchblade and uses it on the latch.

SHAWN:
Don't you have a key for that?

STALLINGS:
For this room? No. Big Bad Bryant took it away a few weeks after they got here.

GUS:
Why?

STALLINGS:
A few small items go missing, suddenly everyone gets suspicious.

SHAWN:
Items such as?

STALLINGS:
A watch, a comb, some mail.

SHAWN:
Whose mail?

STALLINGS:
The dead guy, Bryant.

GUS:
Did you read it?

STALLINGS:
Well, of course I did. You know, he became quite a jerk. I don't know if Hugo knows this or not, but he was dissolving the partnership. Apparently, he had some big plans for himself. I don't know. Correspondence for jobs he didn't seem qualified for, like heading university departments, NASA...

SHAWN:
NASA?

STALLINGS pulls hard on the knife and it comes out of the door. He turns on SHAWN who backs away from the knife.

STALLINGS:
Now, who are you guys again?

GUS:
We think something bad went down in there.

STALLINGS:
Yes, something bad did go down in here.

INT. SPACE CENTER, OBSERVATORY, DAY

STALLINGS opens the door to the observatory and lets SHAWN and GUS in first while he stays by the door.

SHAWN:
Did you see anything?

STALLINGS:
No, but, you know, the dead guy, he changed. They were friends at the beginning. Hugo was always being nice to him, you know? In fact, Hugo's the only one around here who's nice to me. He brings me coffee in the mornings, although he brings it for everybody. All four of us. Three of
us.

SHAWN and GUS are searching the area as STALLINGS talks.

SHAWN:
Stallings, I'll be nice to you, just do me a favor. Stop stealing the gum out of my locker, okay?

STALLINGS:
(chuckles nervously) You spotted that?

SHAWN:
Sure did. (opens log books) Hey, uh, do you know how these books worked?

STALLINGS:
Oh, they switched up every couple hours. One looks, one writes. You know, they do it from dark till dusk all the time. (pauses) Hugo's here.

SHAWN:
How do you know that?

STALLINGS:
Ah, he gets here at the same time every day. You could set your clock to it. Um, hey, you should hurry. You don't have long.

SHAWN:
Thanks, dude.

STALLINGS:
Uh-huh. (leaves)

SHAWN:
Gus, come check this out.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Look, there's a page missing from this log book. I noticed it the first time I was here. Look. (points at entry) June 21st.

GUS:
What does the book track?

SHAWN:
It's like Stallings said. It's, like, every manual adjustment they make, who does it, which guy was on the scope. (flips pages) See, it looks like they switch shifts about every two hours, right? So why remove this page? You go from 8:39 with Hugo to 10:42 with Bryant. So the
question is, what happened between 8:39 and 10:42 on June 21st?

GUS:
Some bad juju.

SHAWN:
We got to get out of here. (puts books back)

GUS:
Why?

SHAWN:
Why? Gus, if someone finds me in here, I could get fired. (runs for the door)

GUS:
Why do you keep running like that?

INT. SPACE CENTER, EXHIBIT HALLS, DAY

SHAWN and GUS meet up with JESSICA.

JESSICA:
Hey, you guys.

GUS:
Um, hey, what's up?

JESSICA:
Gus, about tonight...

GUS:
Oh, if you have other obligations, that's cool.

JESSICA:
No, I just wanted to see if we could go at 6:30 instead.

SHAWN:
That's perfect. That's even better. (to GUS) Look, I need to borrow your motorcycle tonight. You can use my little blue car.

JESSICA:
Ooh, yeah, do that, Gus.

SHAWN:
Settled. Bye, Jess!

JESSICA:
Bye. (waves and leaves)

EXT. SPACE CENTER, DAY

HUGO pulls up in an old VW van. STALLINGS takes a case from the back as HUGO hands one of the coffees to JESSICA who is waiting. SHAWN and GUS watch.

HUGO:
I think you are this one.

GUS:
What's that in his case?

SHAWN:
Tracking readouts. Dude, it's just a bunch of paperwork. I saw it at the observatory.

HUGO gives a coffee to STALLINGS.

GUS:
Why does he keep it locked up like that?

SHAWN:
That's a good question.

HUGO sees SHAWN and GUS as he picks up his case and walks towards them.

HUGO:
Morning, gentlemen! You up already?

SHAWN:
I had to check the timers on the crab spray. You need any help with that giant thing?

HUGO:
Nah, I can manage it. Only got two more weeks of this before my time's up. Might as well follow it through to the end. (heads up the ramp to the entrance)

SHAWN:
You know what that means.

GUS:
I have no idea what that means.

SHAWN:
That means he's not at his house. (runs off)

GUS:
So? (follows)

EXT. HUGO'S HOUSE, DAY

The yard is overgrown with flowers and the house is "tired". SHAWN and GUS walk around the side of the house.

SHAWN:
Rainier's not exactly a high roller, huh? Look at that. It should say "Welcome to Camp Something".

GUS:
Huh.

SHAWN:
Stargazing isn't the most lucrative field.

GUS:
Well, you can make up to a hundred grand a year on the lecture circuit, if you're a name.

SHAWN struggles as he tries to open a window.

GUS:
You're going to break that.

SHAWN:
(grunts and gives up) I don't think so!

They continue on to the back of the house and SHAWN is surprised by a flowerbed.

SHAWN:
Whoa!

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Oh, boy! What is this awful purple stuff?

GUS:
They're flowers.

SHAWN:
Flowers?

GUS:
It's a garden.

SHAWN:
It's a vegetable garden. These are flowers. Weird flowers. (pulls up some of the flowers)

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
Well, I've got to check this out.

GUS:
Let Lassiter do that.

SHAWN:
Gus, Lassiter has to come here on his own, and he's got to be right. (heads to the front of the house)

GUS:
So who are you going to get to check that out for us?

SHAWN:
Well, who else do you know who spends all day in his yard? (groans)

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, DAY

HENRY opens the door to SHAWN and GUS. SHAWN has the plant in a bag.

HENRY:
Shawn! (sees the flowers) Oh, you shouldn't have.

SHAWN:
Dad, we need to talk business. You're not answering your phone. What's going on? Did you even check it?

HENRY:
My phone's been fine, Shawn. I'm just a little busy right now.

SHAWN:
Busy with what?

HENRY:
Things, Shawn. I have things.

WOMAN: (off camera)
Henry, where are the towels?

HENRY:
(turns his head to answer) Uh, I'll tell you in a minute! (looks back to SHAWN)

SHAWN:
(stammers) Was that a woman? You have a woman in there?

HENRY:
What do you think?

SHAWN:
Where did you meet a woman?

HENRY:
Are you really interested?

SHAWN:
(stammers) It's a... It's a question, Dad. It's an enquiry.

HENRY:
On the Internet. Shawn, look, she's a very nice lady. Her name is Sylvia. She runs a catering business, has two kids. (slides the door open wider) Would you like to meet her?

SHAWN:
Oh, God, no! Are you kidding?

HENRY:
Good. Then can we pick this up tomorrow?

SHAWN:
Yeah, I'd be glad to.

HENRY:
Good.

HENRY closes the door and, stunned, SHAWN drops the plant to the porch. He turns and leaves the yard.

EXT. BEACH WALK, DAY

SHAWN walks briskly and GUS keeps pace.

GUS:
You must have thought your dad dated again.

SHAWN:
Honestly, Gus, It haven't given it a lot of thought.

GUS:
It's been 15 years.

SHAWN:
Yeah, you know what? It's fine. It's great. Good for him.

GUS:
You want to talk about it?

SHAWN:
No.

GUS:
Good. You left your plant there.

SHAWN:
I know.

GUS:
Want to go back and get it?

SHAWN:
No.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is on the phone.

JULIET:
Okay, June 21st is missing from the log book? No, I'll check on that right away.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is on the phone with JULIET.

SHAWN:
Sweet. So, uh, does Lassiter need any more help?

JULIET:
No. Shawn, he's on fire. He's already had the autopsy test rerun, and he's contacted every relative that he had.

LASSITER:
That a personal call, O'Hara?

JULIET:
Yes.

LASSITER:
Well, wrap it up. I think I'm onto something. I think he was killed by someone he knew.

JULIET:
I got to go. (hangs up phone before standing up to look at notes with LASSITER)

LASSITER:
Bryant Vallery opened a safety deposit box account in June.

JULIET:
Was it on June 21st?

LASSITER:
Was what June 21st?

JULIET:
I don't know. Didn't you say something about June 21st yesterday?

LASSITER:
I've said so many things the last few days. Refresh my memory.

JULIET smiles.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS is checking his reflection in the clear board for his date with JESSICA. SHAWN walks in from the other room.

SHAWN:
Dude, you look sharp.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
I got one more thing for you.

GUS:
What's that?

SHAWN dangles some electronics in front of him.

GUS:
You want me to wear a wire?

SHAWN:
Just this little baby one. Look, in the event that she actually did it, right? She's not going to suspect you.

GUS:
Forget it, Shawn. I'm gonna sit down with her for 30 minutes, ask a few questions, and keep it cool. Just in case she didn't kill the guy.

SHAWN:
All right, here's a compromise. Let me follow you.

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Come on, from a safe distance! It'll be, like, 30 yards.

GUS:
Consider me stealth, Shawn. (with a last look, walks out)

SHAWN:
Hey, be careful. (looks at the board) You know, we have a mirror in the bathroom.

EXT. PIER, DAY

GUS and JESSICA walk along the pier at sunset.

JESSICA:
You seem... jumpy.

GUS:
Me? Oh, no. No, no. I'm excited. So, uh, tell me about this guy you just broke up with.

JESSICA:
Exes? Ooh! Don't you know the number-one rule of first dates, Gus?

GUS:
I'm very comfortable talking about anything.

JESSICA:
Well, there's not much to tell, really.

GUS:
Mmm-hmm.

JESSICA:
About a month in, I find out he's married.

GUS:
Right.

JESSICA:
Just my luck. And then he kept calling. He actually thought I'd be okay with the whole dirty scenario. He just... he wasn't the guy I thought he was, in a lot of ways.

They stop and lean against the rail by a bench with a blanket on it.

GUS:
Wow, that's...that's great.

JESSICA:
Why?

GUS:
I don't know.

JESSICA:
Hey, I'm sorry about having to go earlier. It's just everything changed at the observatory, and I got to get to work early tomorrow, so...

GUS:
What's going on?

JESSICA:
Well, don't tell anyone, but Hugo and Bryant may have discovered a planet.

GUS:
Get out of here!

JESSICA:
Yeah! An extra-solar planet. About six months ago, I think. Bryant kind of clued me in the night they found it. He was so excited. They had to track their data, wait for the planet to come around again and complete its orbit.

GUS:
Right.

JESSICA:
So it must be verified now. I mean, you don't just call press conferences for nothing, right? Hugo is over the moon. Yeah, he's going to be famous forever. Do you have any idea how huge this is for someone's career?

GUS:
Um ...

SHAWN:
(rises from the bench) Of course he does!

GUS:
Shawn? I was in stealth mode! How did you find me?

JESSICA:
You knew he was following you?

GUS:
No, not at all.

SHAWN:
Jessica, this is a good thing. It means we don't suspect you anymore.

JESSICA:
"We"? (turns to GUS) Suspect me of what?

GUS:
I didn't think you killed him, Jessica.

JESSICA:
Killed?

GUS:
And I hope this doesn't create trust issues for our future.

JESSICA crosses her arms and looks at them both.

GUS:
We just need to establish motive.

SHAWN:
Dude, we totally established motive!

SHAWN holds out his fist, but GUS only glares at him. SHAWN stares at his fist when GUS doesn't properly respond.

JESSICA:
Well, congratulations, Gus, whatever you are. You've got your motive, whatever that is, but you no longer have a date. (storms off)

GUS:
No!

SHAWN:
Jessie!

GUS grunts at SHAWN in frustration before running after JESSICA.

GUS:
Jessica, hold on a second!

SHAWN is still standing there with his fist out.

SHAWN:
Gus! Man, that's twice!

SHAWN fist bumps the air.

INT. SPACE CENTER, PLANETARIUM, DAY

The press conference is underway.

HUGO:
...and to the Santa Barbara Space Center for the use of their facility. I dedicate this to my departed comrade, Bryant Vallery.

REPORTER 1:
Professor! Professor! When was the discovery made?

HUGO:
The 21st of June, 9:55 PM, during a routine changeover between my partner and myself.

SHAWN and GUS are watching from a distance. JESSICA is there as well.

HUGO:
While readjusting some coordinates, I inadvertently made what is certainly the discovery of my lifetime.

REPORTER 2:
Which one of you made the actual discovery?

HUGO:
It was me. We traded off chairs every two hours. This was completely by accident.

REPORTER 2:
What about a book? Surely you'll have a lot of book offers.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Gus, you know what this means.

GUS:
(whispers) It's murder.

SHAWN:
(whispers) It's... No, it's motive.

GUS:
(whispers) That's what I said.

SHAWN:
(whispers) No, you said, "It's murder".

GUS:
(whispers) It's the same thing. Motive, murder, it's the same thing.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Motive is the reason for doing...

GUS:
(whispers) It's in the same family, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Shh! Shh! (turns back to conference)

HUGO:
Now, this planet has everything required for an earth-like structure. It has proximity, it has the right orbit, it has its own energy source...

SHAWN'S cell phone rings.

GUS:
You've got to change that phone's settings.

SHAWN:
(looks at phone and sighs) Jeez. (answers) Hello.

Shawn, what the hell do you think you're doing?

SHAWN:
Look, Dad, I can't talk to you about your love life, ok? I can't do it.

HENRY:
My love life? Are you still on that? (crosses yard to trash bin) I'm talking about this foxglove you left on my porch.

SHAWN:
Foxglove?

GUS turns around at the mention of the plant.

HENRY:
Your little plant with the dirty roots. It's all over my welcome mat.

GUS:
(walks over) That was foxglove?

SHAWN:
(covers phone with his hand) What the hell's foxglove?

HENRY:
Some neighbor's cat could have wandered in, chewed on it, and croaked right in my front yard, Shawn.

SHAWN covers the phone again as GUS explains.

GUS:
Some foxglove has a chemical called digitalis in its leaves.

SHAWN:
What is that, like poison?

GUS:
It's a medicine.

HENRY:
And you know how I feel about dead things in my yard.

SHAWN:
Look Dad, I'm sorry, I got to go. I can't have two people solving my case at once.

HENRY:
Shawn, we should talk.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Ok, fine. I'll be at Tom Blair's pub on Friday. Come by.

HENRY:
I got a date on Friday. Can you do Saturday? (throws away foxglove)

SHAWN:
Never mind. (ends call)

GUS:
Digitalis is prescribed for heart conditions.

SHAWN:
I don't see how that helps us, Gus.

GUS:
It can cause toxicity in someone who doesn't have a heart problem.

SHAWN:
Wouldn't that show up on an autopsy?

GUS:
That's the problem. You have to test for digitalis specifically. No one would consider it if someone doesn't have a history of heart problems.

SHAWN:
Shh!

JULIET and LASSITER join them.

SHAWN:
Hey, what are you doing here?

LASSITER:
We just got our motive for murder, Spencer. Hugo found out that Vallery was going to take all the credit for their discovery himself. Cut him out of it entirely.

SHAWN:
Because he was on the scope when they made the find.

LASSITER:
Yes. Maybe. What are you doing here?

SHAWN:
Well, we heard you had the motive, so we rushed down here to volunteer our services.

LASSITER:
Thanks, but I'll take this one myself.

SHAWN:
Okay, but at least tell me about the poison.

LASSITER:
What poison? I didn't say anything about poison.

SHAWN:
You most certainly did.

JULIET:
I heard it.

GUS:
Clear as day.

LASSITER:
Must have slipped out. I have been thinking about poison as a method, but I can't figure out how.

SHAWN:
Would you like me to read your innermost thoughts? Like, deep, deep, deep ones?

LASSITER:
(hesitates) Knock yourself out.

SHAWN:
(walks forward and takes LASSITER'S wrists) Okay, I just want you to relax. Breathe normally. Close your eyes. Can you feel it? (pushes LASSITER'S hands to his cheeks) Can, Can... (groans) You want to check the house, Hugo's house.

LASSITER:
(muffled) I am in the process of getting a warrant.

SHAWN:
What'd he say?

JULIET:
He's in the process of getting a warrant now.

SHAWN:
(releases LASSITER'S hands) The garden, check the garden.

LASSITER:
It's buried there?

SHAWN:
Something's growing. Oh, I'm getting something. I'm getting...I'm getting... Oh, oh, oh...Prince! No. The artist formerly known as Prince. (grunts) Shawn, wrong again! It's Prince after he was known as "the artist formerly known as Prince."

LASSITER:
It's purple.

SHAWN:
Yes! Yes, that's it! You're amazing! Oh, the caverns of knowledge in that thing. (presses his fist against LASSITER'S head)

LASSITER:
Here's the problem. We ran a toxicology report. There's no trace of poison.

SHAWN:
Of course. Thank you, detective. So what you're saying is he would have had to administer it very, very slowly.

LASSITER:
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. How do you poison someone slowly?

SHAWN sees the coffee in JESSICA'S hands and remembers what STALLINGS said.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

STALLINGS:
He brings me coffee in the mornings, although he brings it for everybody. All four of us. Three of us.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SHAWN:
Coffee.

LASSITER:
No, I'm good.

GUS:
Tea!

LASSITER:
Well, if you're going.

GUS:
It had to be the tea. The leaves wouldn't stand out in the tea.

LASSITER:
Hugo poisoned his tea!

SHAWN:
Every day for six months.

GUS:
Digitalis would cause arrhythmia in a healthy heart. (pumps fist in excitement)

LASSITER:
Which would disappear as soon as someone died.

GUS:
(jumps up and down) I solved it!

SHAWN:
No, you didn't.

GUS:
Yes, I did!

JULIET:
No, you didn't.

GUS:
(stops dance) Yes, I did. Oh, that's right. You did.

LASSITER:
O'Hara, call the coroner tell him to check for even the slightest traces of digitalis. And get me a new pair of handcuffs.

SHAWN smiles and slaps LASSITER on the back as he walks away. SHAW, GUS and JULIET share a smile as LASSITER approaches HUGO and whispers in his ear before taking him by the arm.

HUGO:
(into microphone) Uh, that'll be all.

The reporters clamor as LASSITER leads HUGO off, waving at the press himself. JULIET, SHAWN and GUS share a three-part fist bump.

INT SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER walks happily through the halls, basking in the admiration from his fellow police.

LASSITER:
Hi. Thank you. Thanks. Just part of the job. (sees SHAWN) Spencer, a moment of your precious time. (pulls SHAWN by the elbow into VICK'S office)

INT SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN:
Uh, are you sure we should be in here?

LASSITER:
(puts briefcase on desk and looks out the door towards JULIET) That night in the bar, I mentioned my wife, didn't I?

SHAWN:
Yes.

LASSITER:
Oh, crap. What did I say, exactly?

Outside, GUS walks over to join JULIET.

SHAWN:
That she wants you back.

LASSITER:
No, no, I don't think I said that.

SHAWN:
Maybe I sensed that.

LASSITER:
You didn't sense it either, but thanks for trying to help. Tell you the truth, I think I got some help on this case.

SHAWN:
(looks at JULIET) Really?

LASSITER:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Well, hey, man, we all get help sometimes, right? It's the truly great ones that know how to accept it. And, if I may add one more thing, detective, you astound me.

LASSITER:
Second half to that joke?

SHAWN:
No.

LASSITER:
No?

JULIET joins them.

JULIET:
The press is asking for you outside.

LASSITER:
Tell them I will be right there.

JULIET leaves.

LASSITER:
To tell you the truth, Spencer, sometimes I astound myself. (points to tie) How's the knot?

SHAWN:
Tight.

LASSITER:
Great. (leaves)

INT. TOM BLAIR'S PUB, NIGHT

HENRY is sitting at the bar sipping a beer when SHAWN walks up behind him. HENRY senses him there and glances back before setting down his beer.

SHAWN:
All alone, huh?

HENRY:
That would appear to be the case.

SHAWN:
It's a Friday night. What happened to Sylvia?

HENRY:
Would you believe that I didn't want to hurt your feelings? Sit down. Have a drink.

SHAWN sits on the stool nest to HENRY with a sigh.

SHAWN:
You buying?

HENRY:
You kidding?

Episode 1x11 He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, He Loves Me...Oops, He's Dead

1985

EXT. SPENCER HOUSE, DAY

HENRY is sitting at the picnic table reading the paper when SHAWN tries to sneak past him. HENRY sees him.

HENRY:
Shawn! Stop.

SHAWN stops

HENRY:
Turn around.

SHAWN raises his head and we see he has a black eye.

HENRY:
Turn around. What are you hiding?

SHAWN slowly turns around and HENRY sees his face.

HENRY:
Did you get in a fight, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Kinda.

HENRY:
Kinda? What do you mean, kinda? What did I tell you about fighting? Get over here, son.

SHAWN walks over as HENRY stands.

HENRY:
Let me take a look at that. (looks at SHAWN'S face) You really got punched. (puts ice in a napkin)Here, hold that on your eye.

SHAWN puts the napkin to his eye and HENRY sits on the table.

HENRY:
All right, tell me... what's the name of this kid who hit you?

SHAWN:
Elizabeth.

HENRY:
You got in a fight with a girl?

SHAWN:
It wasn't really a fight. She just punched me.

HENRY:
Well, why in the world would she punch you? (removes SHAWN'S baseball cap) What... what happened?

SHAWN:
She asked me to sit next to her at lunch, and I did. And then I was eating my tater tots, then she just punched me.

HENRY:
Wait a second. Wait a second. What was she doing while you were eating your tater tots?

SHAWN:
I don't know. She was talking about something.

HENRY:
What? What was she talking about?

SHAWN:
I have no idea. She just went on and on, and I was concentrating on my tater tots.

HENRY:
(chuckles) Well, I'll be damned. Shawn, I know what happened. You just had your first date. (pokes SHAWN in the chest) Sit. Sit.

HENRY stands and walks to the other side of the table and sits down on the bench. SHAWN sits opposite him.

SHAWN:
My first what?

HENRY:
Look, obviously, this Elizabeth girl likes you. That's why she invited you over to sit next to her.

SHAWN:
Then why did she sock me in the eye?

HENRY:
Because she likes you, and you didn't listen to her story. Women want you to listen to them, Shawn. They want you to pick up every small detail, and they want you to compliment them. It's about tuning in to people. It's about getting inside their heads and anticipating their needs. And this applies to all aspects of life. Not only this girl, Elizabeth, but...even your barber.

SHAWN:
But I don't want to date the barber.

HENRY:
Shawn, I know that one day all of this is going to make sense to you. You just have to believe me. But for now, I'm going to leave you with one very simple rule. Under no circumstances, ever, ever do you mention to a woman her age or her weight.

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN is standing in the center of the room, officers and detectives watching him.

SHAWN:
Nobody breathe. I've got it. I've got it in grams. I've got it in minutes. Just give me a second here to do a little converting.

SHAWN looks at a desk and sees a plaque for Class of 1996 and cards for a diet.

SHAWN:
I got it. 37 years old. 127 pounds.

Everyone is amazed.

FEMALE OFFICER:
That was amazing. How did you do that?

Everyone claps.

FEMALE OFFICER:
I have to admit, though, sadly, It's just a teensy bit higher in the weight department.

SHAWN:
Oh, you know what? That's my bad. I believe I was getting a "future reading" from next week. It happens. I apologize. Wait. I'm also getting a dance belt...

In front of her office, VICK hands LASSITER a folder.

VICK:
You are my head detective.

LASSITER takes the folder with sufferance as VICK goes into her office.

SHAWN:
And fishnet stockings. But that's this guy. (points to officer to his left) That's this guy here.

GUS sees LASSITER looking straight at SHAWN.

GUS:
Shawn. Shawn.

SHAWN:
I'm kidding. You're such a good sport. Everybody loves you.

LASSITER:
Hey, Spencer.

SHAWN:
Lassie-Face!(walks over)

LASSITER:
(meets SHAWN halfway) I've got the perfect case for you guys. (gives SHAWN folder)

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, you're saying that you want our help?

LASSITER:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
What's the catch? (opens folder)

LASSITER:
There's no catch. It's just right up your alley. I could really use your insights on this one. Guy's waiting to give you a statement. Interrogation room "B". (pats SHAWN on the back) Make me proud. (walks away)

GUS:
Okay. What does that sound like to you?

SHAWN:
An opportunity. (closes folder and follows after LASSITER)

GUS:
No.

INT. SBPD, LOWER LEVEL, DAY

GUS follows SHAWN down the stairs.

GUS:
You think Lassiter is going to just hand us over a case? Stop, let's think about this for a minute.

SHAWN:
Gus, come on.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
We're going to roll up our sleeves, we're going to get a little bit dirty and we're going to do some old-fashioned police work. (stops outside interrogation room B) Come on, this is like In the Heat of the Night Which makes me Carroll O'Connor.

GUS:
No, that means you're Rod Steiger. That way, I'm Sidney Poitier.

SHAWN:
You know that's right.

They enter Interrogation Room B.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM B, DAY

SHAWN:
Oh, boy.

Sitting behind the table is a heavy-set naked man. SHAWN averts his eyes.

GUS:
Wow.

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER is watching through the two-way mirror.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM B, DAY

SHAWN:
Looks like somebody beat us to the rolling up the sleeves.

GUS:
No. (starts to leave)

SHAWN:
What are you doing?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(whispers) This is our case.

GUS:
(whispers) He's naked.

SHAWN:
(whispers) We got to work the room.

GUS:
(whispers) I'm going to work it from the outside.

SHAWN:
(whispers) You can work it from in here. Now, shut the door.

GUS shuts the door and SHAWN stands in front of the table. GUS stays by the door, looking out the window.

SHAWN:
Mr. (checks folder) Turk, is it? My name's Shawn Spencer. I'm the head "P" for the SBPD.

TURK:
You're the who for the what?

SHAWN:
Don't concern yourself with formalities, Mr. Turk. I'm here to take your statement, find out just what exactly happened to you.

TURK:
Well, I don't really remember much.

SHAWN:
Funny. It says here you told the desk sergeant you woke up naked in a field with your ass hanging out.

TURK:
Yeah, that's right. I mean, I don't remember exactly what they look like. You know, it's all really confusing for me right now.

SHAWN:
When you say "they", just who are you referring to?

TURK:
The aliens.

GUS turns around and looks at him.

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER chuckles.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM B, DAY

GUS:
See?

SHAWN sees a stylized heart stamp on the inside of TURK'S wrist.

SHAWN:
Right, aliens. Here it is. Page two. Got it. How would you describe these aliens, Mr. Turk? Would you say they were small? Would you say they were green?

TURK:
You know, I- I don't really recall right now. I've got this headache, and... Who is that person over there? Because he's really making me uncomfortable.

GUS:
I'm making you uncomfortable right now? Dude, is there any reason why you're not wearing clothes now?

TURK:
Hey, I think I might have been abducted, all right? I believe I might've been experimented on so there's no way I'm going to touch these clothes and compromise evidence!

SHAWN:
Okay, okay, Mr. Turk. Please, try to gain control of your considerable person. Why don't you cover up with a towel? That's why it's there. One size fits all... I hope. (spots streaks of dirt on TURK'S heel)

TURK:
All right. I'll cover up with the towel, but first, does somebody want to check me for scars?

TURK stands quickly and puts himself against the two-way mirror, spreading his arms for someone to "examine" him.

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER ducks away from the mirror.

LASSITER:
Oh, good Lord!

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM B, DAY

SHAWN turns his head away and exclaims in disgust.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is sitting behind his desk and GUS is sitting on a chair in front of it.

GUS:
Are you really willing to just dismiss the idea that there's life on other planets?

SHAWN:
This is what I've got. I know he was dragged out there. Otherwise, no sign of assault. Nothing taken. Aside from the embarrassment of waking up naked in a field we've got nothing to hang our hats on. (holds up newspaper with photo of TURK covering himself) I guess technically We could have hung our hats on it.

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
Sorry. (puts down paper)

GUS:
Look, if it's not the alien thing, then how do you explain the memory loss the confusion, the fact that he saw a little green man?

SHAWN:
Hallucinations.

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
What? Dude, you're the expert here.

GUS gets up in disgust and walks to his desk.

SHAWN:
Come on, man, there's got to be some drug that would cause a combination of those three things. Think. Drugs!

GUS:
(sits behind desk) Oh, you're asking me?

SHAWN:
Sure.

GUS:
Well, let me see. Off the top of my head any SSRIS, Tramadol, Bupropion, proton pump inhibitors. Venlafaxine, Ropinirole.

SHAWN:
That's good work, buddy.

GUS:
B-adrenoreceptor antagonists.

SHAWN:
Okay, gold star for Gus.

GUS:
Phencyclidine, ketamine, bufotenine.

SHAWN:
You're not going to stop, are you?

GUS:
Did I already say venlafaxine?

SHAWN:
There's no way to be sure.

GUS:
Wait, wait a second. Didn't he say something to you about...about smelling lavender? (walks around to front of desk)

SHAWN:
He said right before he blacked out he remembered the strong scent of lavender and seeing, uh, barbed wire.

GUS:
Right.

SHAWN:
Wait a second. Gus, that's not a hallucination. That's a location.

GUS:
That's what I'm saying.

SHAWN:
And I know exactly where it is. (stands and throws the car keys to GUS)

EXT. FIELD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS arrive at a field surrounded by a fence topped with barbed wire. The police are there. They walk the dirt road and see a man, Philip KEISER with a towel around his waist talking with LASSITER and JULIET.

SHAWN:
Dude, I've driven by this place at least twice. The question is, what are the cops doing here?

OFFICER on RADIO:
...body of another male Caucasian, early 30s, possible 314. Officers on scene.

GUS:
(looks at SHAWN) Johnny.

SHAWN:
Oh.

They stop at the gate and SHAWN sees tire treads in the dirt, a slim strap of leather with a buckle and an undisturbed spider web to the side of the entry with a strand of hair caught in the silk higher up. He then looks at the victim who is nervously holding the towel as he talks to the detectives.

KEISER:
Look, I saw the picture of that Turk guy in the paper. Now it's me in a field naked, headache? You do the math.

JULIET:
Do you remember seeing anything out of the ordinary?

KEISER:
Uh... I don't remember much at all.

LASSITER:
So you just woke up in a field wearing nothing but your birthday suit?

KEISER:
Look, I told you yes already. Are you going to give me a hard time? 'Cause I'm a little freaked out as it is. And can somebody get me a bigger towel? This thing is like the size of a wash cloth.

A crime scene photographer takes his photograph.

KEISER:
What are you, some kind of pervert?

LASSITER:
Cut him some slack. He's just doing his job. (walks away) You think he gets his jollies taking pictures of your ding-dong?

SHAWN and GUS jog up to LASSITER and JULIET.

SHAWN:
Lassie!

LASSITER:
What are you guys doing here?

SHAWN:
This is my case. You gave it to me, remember?

LASSITER:
Look, it's a copycat, okay? He saw Turk's picture in the paper. He's looking for attention.

GUS:
So he wakes up and sees Turk in the paper naked, humiliated, the butt of jokes at the water cooler and says, "Hmm. How can I make this work for myself?" What?

SHAWN:
(scratches right arm) Plus, it's really itchy out here.

LASSITER:
When you get your master's degree in criminology, then you can call me. In the mea ntime, I've got a half-eaten enchirito in my car. (puts on sunglasses and heads for car)

SHAWN looks over at KEISER and sees the same stamp on his wrist that TURK had.

SHAWN:
All right, here we go. You're up.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Do it.

GUS:
I'm not doing that.

SHAWN:
Dude. I took the fat guy in the police station.

GUS:
I'm not doing that.

SHAWN:
This is a much better pull.

GUS:
I'm not doing that, Shawn.

SHAWN:
We're partners. (GUS walks away) Gus! (looks back at KEISER and makes a face)

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS cross a downtown street.

GUS:
What does this case have to do with a tanning salon?

SHAWN:
It's the middle of winter in Santa Barbara. Those dudes looked like gingerbread men, without tan lines. They fake and they bake.

GUS:
Shawn, exactly how closely did you look at these naked guys?

SHAWN:
Too close. My heightened observational skills are considered a gift by most, but I'm here to tell you it can be a burden.

GUS:
How do you know it's this place?

SHAWN:
Keiser didn't have any streaks on his buttocks, okay? That screams the Insta-Tan process, and this is the only place that does that.

GUS:
Right.

They enter the salon.

INT. TANNING SALON, DAY

SHAWN:
Plus, they both live within a mile and a half of this joint.

GUS:
Uh-huh.

SHAWN walks to the reception desk where there is a little hand bell. He picks up the bell.

SHAWN:
I can't ring this. (calls for assistance) Hello? Hello? (to GUS) Look, I'm going to snoop around, okay? You find out if Turk or Keiser were here, and if so, when.

GUS:
Oh, Shawn, Shawn. This is not going to work.

SHAWN:
Dude, I've got to do my thing. I've got to mix it up nice.

GUS:
But...

SHAWN:
You always complain you don't get to do the questiony part. (motions to the desk) Questiony part... Gus. (motions back to GUS)

GUS:
Right, but... (SHAWN takes off) You're forgetting something-

A MAN comes out from one of the back rooms wearing a yellow golf shirt tucked into khaki shorts. He goes behind the desk.

MAN:
May I help you?

GUS:
Yes. I'm here for a tanning appointment.

MAN:
For yourself?

GUS:
Yes, for the Insta-Tan process. I would like that.

MAN:
But...

GUS:
What?

MAN:
Well, you're...

GUS:
Yes.

SHAWN:
Uh, I don't understand.

GUS:
Okay, look, screw it. I can't do it. (shows the employee photos of the two men) Have you seen either of these two guys here before? Fred Turk or Philip Keiser?

The MAN nods. GUS heads back deeper into the salon to a small waiting room where he sees SHAWN snooping about.

GUS:
Shawn. Shawn. Okay, both Turk and Keiser not only have been here, but they're regulars. He says it's always the single guys who try to keep up with their tans.

SHAWN:
Single guys?

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Maybe that's it. Maybe some woman is targeting singles at the salon. The question is, what kind of a loser thinks getting a tan is going to help him score a woman?

The door to one of the rooms opens behind them and SHAWN turns around. He first sees the blue police bag and as his eyes travel up the robe-clad man, he sees it's HENRY.

SHAWN:
Dad?

HENRY sets his bag on a table and sits on a couch. GUS sits next to him and SHAWN takes a chair, a pillow on his lap.

SHAWN:
Dad, what are you doing here?

HENRY:
The real question is, what are you doing here?

SHAWN:
Well, George Hamilton, we're on a case. Or maybe you missed the pictures of the guys in the paper in the fields.

HENRY:
Yes, of course I saw it. The nudist guy in the field thinks he was abducted by aliens. Idiot. What does that have to do with this place?

SHAWN:
Well, they're both regulars here. They both happen to be single, so this could be a stalking case.

GUS:
Wait a second. Your dad is single and he comes here all the time.

HENRY:
Everybody comes here.

SHAWN:
(sees something in HENRY'S bag) What is that?

HENRY:
What?

SHAWN:
(grabs the tube and reads it) Exfoliating scrub with pumice.

HENRY:
Whatever, Shawn. All I know is when I varnish my boat and I don't want it to streak, I sand off a layer first. Same thing goes with tanning.

SHAWN:
That is the single most disturbing analogy I have ever heard in my entire life. (slams the tbe back into HENRY'S bag) Where are they?

HENRY:
Who?

SHAWN:
The Queer Eye guys. I know they're here somewhere. Gus, what are their names?

GUS:
How am I supposed to know, Shawn?

HENRY:
Carson and Jai and the guy with the glasses.

GUS:
Oh yeah, who cooks the fish.

HENRY:
Right. (looks at GUS before turning to SHAWN) Shawn, you know what your real problem is? You got yourself another case, and, as usual, you're short-sighted. You think it's all impressive, cause you see a couple of nude guys in a field, you put a fix on 'em here. Well, it's not enough.

SHAWN:
This is what we know. Both these guys are trying to impress someone, which means a woman was involved, and that same woman was with them in the field.

GUS:
Shawn saw a woman's shoe strap in the field.

SHAWN:
How or why she connects to them, I just... I just don't know yet.

HENRY:
Well, you're not looking close enough. (opens legs and robe barely covers)

SHAWN:
Believe me, I've looked just about as close as I can bear.

HENRY looks down, makes a face and puts his knees together.

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS cross a downtown street.

SHAWN:
I'm with you on the aliens thing. They're here, and they've swapped out my father with Jose Eber.

They arrive at the Echo.

GUS:
I think your dad might be right. I think we should get Turk and Keiser in the same room and actually ask them some questions.

SHAWN:
Fine. Let's do it. The rule is all slacks, all the time, no exceptions.

GUS:
I hear that. I've reached my naked man quota for the year. (gets in the car)

SHAWN'S cell rings and he answers it.

SHAWN:
Hello? We'll be there.

EXT. FIELD, DAY

VICK is waiting for them outside the same field as before.

VICK:
Step inside, guys. Your case just became legitimate. Consider yourself hired. I need answers, and I need them quick.

VICK lifts up the crime scene tape and they all duck under.

SHAWN:
Well, I do have something, chief. I'm getting... I'm getting skin pigment. Bronzed, glistening... (sees two parallel streaks on gatepost) Adonis-like skin pigment. You lead me through this field, you let me ask one question, I guarantee it's going to come down to spray tanning.

They stop at the sight of a dead man face-down on the ground. LASSITER and JULIET are examining the site. His lower body has been covered with a towel. He also has the same mark on his wrist.

VICK:
Well, this guy's never seen the inside of a tanning salon.

GUS:
I don't think he ever saw the sun.

VICK:
You've got 24 hours. Call me with something. (walks away)

LASSITER:
Grab a CSI. Verify time of death.

SHAWN:
Looks like we might have to open a kennel for all these copycats.

LASSITER looks at SHAWN before walking away. JULIET follows.

SHAWN:
Well, we're back to square one.

GUS:
I don't know, Shawn. Maybe square one is the answer. Maybe this is something beyond our comprehension. Something otherworldly.

SHAWN:
I hear what you're saying. Do me a favor.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Let go of the alien angle. We need something solid, Gus. Something... something concrete. You heard the Chief.

SHAWN takes in the partial stamp and pieces it together from the others to form a shamrock.

SHAWN:
Dude, how do you feel about leprechauns?

INT. RESTAURANT, DAY

The restaurant is tackily decorated like St. Patrick's Day with large green shamrock decorations and green lights wrapped around railings. The host, MARVIN, comes up to them dressed as a leprechaun and speaks in a fake Irish accent.

MARVIN:
Oh, well, hello, me buckos. I'm Marvin. Welcome to Shenanigans, home of the world-famous Blarney Stone fajitas.

SHAWN:
Hello, Marvin. We're here to speak with a leprechaun.

MARVIN:
(regular voice) Ha, ha. Very funny. Please stop. My tummy's aching from laughing so hard. Do you guys want a table or what?

SHAWN:
Dude, give me some props. He's got a hat with a buckle on it. Everything is green.

GUS:
What? He's not a leprechaun.

SHAWN:
Will you do me a favor? In your funny accent, will you say, "magically delicious"?

MARVIN forces a laugh. On the podium, SHAWN sees a shamrock stamp.

SHAWN:
Is that the world-famous clover stamp?

MARVIN:
That's the one.

SHAWN:
(grabs GUS' wrist) Will you stamp my buddy's wrist?

MARVIN:
(picks up stamp) Whatever floats your boat, man. (stamps GUS) It's for our nighttime events there. But hey, you can have it in the daytime, too.

GUS:
What nighttime events?

MARVIN:
We have speed dating here.

GUS:
Speed dating?

MARVIN:
Yeah. Don't laugh. It's actually one of our most popular events. Guys come in here, sign up, they put down 100 bucks and they get fixed up with all sorts of people on little six-minute mini-dates.

GUS:
Did you say 100 bucks?

MARVIN:
100 bucks.

SHAWN:
How about 50 bucks for three-minute dates?

GUS:
25 bucks for a minute and a half?

SHAWN:
I float you a ten spot, you introduce us to somebody for 15 seconds.

All three force laughter.

MARVIN:
How about you guys either get a table or I'm going to have to ask you to leave the podium?

SHAWN:
How about "magically delicious"? Will you say "magically delicious"?

MARVIN:
No, but I can say "police" if you don't get your butts out of here. (turns to other customers and speaks in brogue) Hello there! I'm Marvin. Welcome to Shenanigans. Home of the world-famous Blarney Stone fajitas.

INT. TURK'S HOME, DAY

The living room is lined with cuckoo clocks of varying sizes and colors. It is loud as they tick away the seconds. GUS and SHAWN are sitting on the couch.

TURK:
Yeah, I tried the speed-dating thing a couple of times. I just didn't think it had anything to do with the case, and I was a little embarrassed about it.

GUS:
Wow, you paid 100 bucks?

SHAWN:
Mr. Turk, we feel it has everything to do with the case, all right? Both Phil Keiser and the guy who turned up dead attended these speed-dating events.

The clocks begin chiming at once. SHAWN looks at GUS.

GUS:
(talking above the clocks) Do you remember anything strange happening there? Or meeting anyone odd?

TURK:
(talking loudly) The only odd thing was that the ladies didn't take to me like they usually do.

SHAWN:
(loudly) That's beyond odd. I can't imagine why, Fred.

TURK:
Here's the thing, though. Other strange things have been happening to me ever since I was at the event.

GUS:
Like what?

TURK:
Well, I applied for a job recently. I was a perfect candidate. I had several interviews, and then suddenly, after the final one, I was rejected.

SHAWN:
Let me ask you a question, Freddy, and please be honest. Were you on time for these interviews?

TURK:
Yes. Why do you ask?

SHAWN:
I have no reason.

EXT. TURK'S HOME, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk to the car.

SHAWN:
I think there's a woman involved here who had it out for these guys. We need to get a first-hand look at this speed-dating phenomenon.

GUS:
Not for 100 bucks, we don't.

SHAWN:
Gus, please. Leave it to me.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK is sitting behind her desk. SHAWN is sitting in one of the chairs in front of the desk, GUS standing next to him, while LASSITER rests his arm on the bookshelf by the door, smiling at the whole thing. JULIET stands next to him. SHAWN has a red flower stuck down his shirt.

VICK:
Let me get this straight. There is a dead body and a murder loose in our city and you want the Santa Barbara Police Department to pay for you to go on dates?

SHAWN:
Yes, that's correct. I mean, I suppose we could split it if we had to. What's that called? Going... going Deutsch? (looks at GUS before looking back at VICK) We'll go Deutsch.

VICK:
I am not paying for your dating services, Mr. Spencer.

SHAWN:
Look, here's the catch, Chief. I'm going to be reading these people, psychically. And I don't need six minutes. Give me 40 seconds with these people, I'll be able to tell you if they had anything to do with the murder. And you know what? Gus and I, we really did try to negotiate some sort of partial usage rate, but we got shut down by that leprechaun--

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, enough.

SHAWN:
Wait. I'm getting something else. (puts right hand to head) It's a woman... in sexy high-heeled strappy shoes. (flashes on the strap) She's roughly 5'2"... the hair in the cobweb) Jules, may I please have a pen and something to write on?

JULIET takes a pen and pad from VICK'S desk and hands it to SHAWN. He sketches furiously with a few grunts for emphasis. Finished, he passes the pad to GUS with a gasp. SHAWN closes his eyes and breathes heavily as if it took a lot out of him. GUS looks at the sketch before handing the pad to LASSITER. On it is a drawing of the tire marks from the field and a note.

LASSITER:
(reads) "To Lassie, on the Alpine highway of life, you are my all-weather tires. H & Ks, Shawn." What the hell is this?

JULIET:
"H&k" stands for "hugs and kisses." (smiles)

LASSITER:
Not that part. This part.

GUS:
It's a tire pattern. Run it through the system, and we'll know what kind of car she drives.

LASSITER passes the pad to VICK.

VICK:
Okay, I'll give you a shot at this, but you're not going alone.

SHAWN sits up straight.

VICK:
O'Hara, I want you to go along with these guys undercover working things from the other side. See if you can sift any information from these women.

JULIET:
Will do.

SHAWN:
(smiles at JULIET) Chief, I think that's the best idea you've ever had.

JULIET:
(sarcastic) Shawn, I am so glad you're on board.

VICK:
Detective Lassiter, I'm going to need you too. We don't know what this woman's type is, and besides, you're now leading the case.

LASSITER:
Yeah, you know, Chief, with all due respect, I'm really pretty busy working this case from another angle. I mean, I ran the toxicology reports, and I found that all three victims tested positive for trace amounts of the street drug GHB. But our dead guy had a pre-existing heart condition. So there was a pattern. I think the murder was accidental.

VICK:
And I like that track. Now, follow it up by going to the speed-dating thing. It's just a date, Lassiter. You do know how to conduct yourself on a date, don't you?

LASSITER scoffs.

INT. RESTAURANT, NIGHT

"Love is in the Air" plays in the background. LASSITER arrives still wearing his suit. JULIET has dressed up and has her hair down. SHAWN is wearing a long-sleeve button-down shirt and GUS is wearing a jacket.

LASSITER:
Okay, I checked out your tread pattern. (JULIET hands him a piece of paper) Thank you. It's a high-performance tire manufactured after 2002. So we're looking for a woman who drives a late-model sports car, probably American-made.

GUS:
And 5'2" and likes strappy heels.

SHAWN:
Check. (points at GUS) Question. (points at LASSITER) Is that what you're wearing?

LASSITER:
(looks down at his clothes) What's wrong with what I'm wearing? I always wear this.

SHAWN:
Exactly. Lassie, you look like a cop. Now, come on, man. (taps LASSITER'S side) Is that your holster?

LASSITER:
Of course it is.

SHAWN:
You're here to speed-date, man, not shoot somebody. You got to loosen up. Come on. Take off the tie. (flaps LASSITER'S tie)

LASSITER:
I'm not taking fashion tips from you.

SHAWN:
You need to show some chest hair. Chicks dig the sternum bush. Jules, back me up on the sternum bush.

JULIET:
I'm going to go, see what these women have to say before this thing starts. (walks to the raised section)

SHAWN:
Bye, Jules. All right, come on. Let's go Simon Cowell. You got the salt and pepper, man. It's nice.

LASSITER:
I am not taking off my tie just because you tell me to. (walks to raised section)

SHAWN:
Fine. Suit yourself.

The woman conducting the speed-dating, LORRAINE, starts the proceedings.

LORRAINE:
Ladies and gentlemen. (rings bell) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming. For those of you who are new, I will explain how this works, okay? You will pick a numbered table to begin your first date. Every six minutes, you will hear... (rings bell) That will indicate the end of your time together. And your next date will begin. Now, I know six minutes is not a long time to get to know someone. That's why myself and the other staff will use the questionnaires you filled out to match you up. Okay?

As LORRAINE speaks, MARVIN fills the small snack bowls with popcorn.

LORRAINE:
Love is in the air. I can smell it.

GUS:
(whispers) I smell cabbage.

LORRAINE:
Let the dating begin! (rings bell)

SHAWN is sitting at a table with his first date, GLENDA.

GLENDA:
Shawn. That's a nice name.

SHAWN:
Yeah, it's okay. It's okay. My last name is Hofen-Inderheine. Yeah, it's been a tough life.

GLENDA:
Wow.

SHAWN:
Kids can be cruel.

GLENDA:
Yeah. You know, you could probably change that. What's your mom's maiden name?

SHAWN:
Buzzteets.

GLENDA:
Wow, yeah. "Teets" as in--

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah. All my ancestry, we're farmers.

GLENDA:
Hey, I was raised on a farm.

SHAWN:
No kiddin'.

GLENDA:
(laughs) I had this most adorable little pet goat named Cassie.

SHAWN:
Goat?

GLENDA:
Yeah. Did you ever have any, you know, pets growing up? What were their names? Oh, what's your favorite color?

The bell rings.

LORRAINE:
Move along.

SHAWN leans back in his chair and we see he is sitting next to GUS.

SHAWN:
I think these people might have more luck dating if they asked more interesting questions.

GUS:
I just hope I don't get pile-driven.

We see that GUS is sitting across from a female body-builder who flexes her muscles and growls. The bell rings and then we see LASSITER sitting at a table, no tie.

WOMAN 1:
Carlton, I hope this isn't too forward of me but you have kind eyes.

LASSITER:
Thank you. (pushes his collar open a bit)

GUS is sitting at another table with a young woman, DARCY.

GUS:
This is uncanny.

DARCY:
I know! God, you know I never meet anyone I connect with at these things. That's why I didn't even bother dressing up. I mean, I've given up a little.

GUS:
I think you look great.

DARCY:
Thank you.

At LASSITER'S table...

LASSITER:
So, what kind of car do you drive?

WOMAN 1:
Excuse me?

LASSITER:
You drive a sports car? Mustang, maybe? 2003?

WOMAN 1:
That's kind of a shallow question, isn't it?

LASSITER:
Do you like hanging out in fields?

WOMAN 1:
Okay, you know what? I think this date's over.

LASSITER:
No, I've got three minutes left. Where were you on the night of the 18th?

DARCY:
You know, normally, I would wear a dress.

GUS:
And heels?

DARCY:
Uh, yeah, I guess. Maybe.

GUS:
Like open-toed strappy ones?

DARCY:
What?

GUS:
Huh?

DARCY:
Huh?

GUS:
Is that what you have in your closet? A lot of high-heeled shoes?

DARCY:
Do you have a foot fetish?

GUS:
No!

DARCY scoffs and angrily jots down some notes. The bell rings again. SHAWN is sitting at another table against the wall.

SHAWN:
Look at us. A couple of kids on a proper date, huh? You got some goosebumps?

We see it is JULIET sitting across from him.

JULIET:
Shawn, this isn't a date. It's work.

SHAWN:
You're absolutely right, but hey, you've still got six minutes to ask me anything you want. So, do you want to know? What are you dying to know about Shawn Spencer, the man?

JULIET:
(shakes head) Oddly enough, I don't think I have anything I'm dying to know.

SHAWN:
Okay, Jules, don't lie, because lying is unbecoming. I'll go first. You, me, Burgess Meredith, Hume Cronyn, Nipsey Russell, deserted island, who are you going to sleep with?

JULIET:
So it's you or a bunch of dead guys?

SHAWN:
Fair. I'll give you Scatman Crothers.

JULIET:
Dead.

SHAWN:
Flip Wilson?

JULIET:
Also dead.

SHAWN:
Donald Pleasence.

JULIET:
None of the above.

SHAWN:
None of the above? Jules, are you kidding me? You've got...

Bell rings and SHAWN looks around before turning back to JULIET.

SHAWN:
You're going to miss me, aren't you? A little bit. Have fun on your next date. But I want you to think about that, okay? Like, if that really happened.

JULIET:
Bye, Shawn. (leaves)

The bell rings again. We see MARVIN filling the bowls as the daters change places. LASSITER arrives at his next date and sees it's JULIET. LASSITER turns to walk away and nearly bumps into another man as he goes to sit at the next table. LASSITER changes his mind, pulls his shirt collar close and sits down. They avoid looking at each other, fidgeting with their hands - JULIET checks her watch and LASSITER cracks his knuckles. LORRAINE comes up behind LASSITER.

LORRAINE:
(whispers) Go on. Tell her she looks pretty.

JULIET smiles at his discomfort.

LASSITER:
(whispers) Yeah, no can do.

JULIET eats some of the popcorn.

LORRAINE:
(rings bell) That's it, people! You should have completed all your dates. Please score your cards and check up front at the bar, and we will also tell you who you match from your questionnaires. Okay?

SHAWN is sitting at a table with DARCY.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry.

LORRAINE:
Date's over. (rings bell)

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just haven't been a high-heel guy since Single White Female.

LORRAINE reaches between them and rings the bell.

SHAWN:
I just... yeah. (gets up and leaves)

LORRAINE:
Thank you.

GUS meets up with SHAWN at one of the tables.

SHAWN:
Dude, I think that Darcy girl might be the one. She's the right height, she drives an '04 Trans Am, and she wears nothing but heels.

GUS:
(checks notes) How did you find out about the heels?

SHAWN:
And she works in pharmaceutical sales, just like you. Now, would she have access to that GHB stuff?

GUS:
She certainly would've had access to the drugs to synthesize her own.

SHAWN:
That's sweet. Dude, you got to ask her out.

GUS:
What, and go out with a possible murderer? You must be out of your mind. I'm not doing that.

SHAWN:
Gus, I can't see her on a date. I got to see her in action. I got to look, I got to listen, I got to feel!

GUS:
Shawn, if we think it's her, let's tell Lassiter and Juliet, and get them to bring her in.

SHAWN:
You see what happens when we blurt out our theories. We totally whiffed on the tanning salon.

GUS:
Fine, you go out with her, then.

SHAWN:
I would, but she matched up with you.

DARCY spots them from the other section and waves excitedly.

SHAWN:
Oh, give her the sweetness. Dude, you got to give her the sweetness.

GUS nods and heads over to DARCY. He passes LORRAINE who is dragging a reluctant JULIET with her.

LORRAINE:
This is a speed dating first. You and you are a 100% match from your personality questionnaires. I smell love. (rings bell) Come on. Come on. (leaves)

SHAWN and Juliet laugh in embarrassment, not knowing what to say.

JULIET:
I need a drink.

SHAWN:
I got to pee.

They leave in opposite directions.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY, NIGHT

GUS asks SHAWN for some last-minute advice.

GUS:
Look, I don't know what to say to her. I ran out of topics on the way over here. Plus, she keeps wanting to rub my head. What's up with that?

SHAWN:
Gus, everybody wants to rub your head.

They look over at DARCY who waves from her seat.

SHAWN:
Look, you're doing fine. Okay? Here, here. (reaches into shirt pocket) Here's a list of conversation topics, basic starters. You got your ball, head on over there. I'm right behind you.

GUS:
(reads) "You're stranded on a deserted island and you have to procreate the species." Really? (gives paper back and walks away)

SHAWN:
This is gold. I give you gold.

SHAWN looks across and sees JULIET at one of the lanes with her date, KYLE. He tucks the note back into his pocket, picks up a bowling ball and heads to a nearby lane. JULIET must have done well because she jumps up.

JULIET:
Yes!

KYLE:
That was good.

SHAWN sends his ball down the lane but only hits the 10 pin. JULIET sees him.

JULIET:
Shawn?

SHAWN pretends he didn't know she was there.

SHAWN:
Detective O'Hara.

JULIET:
Shawn, what are you doing here?

SHAWN:
Bowling. At a high level. (blows on fingertips)

JULIET:
By yourself, on a Saturday night?

SHAWN:
I'm in a league. It's semi-pro. I could've gone pro, but I made a choice. I like to get 14, 15 hours of practice in...a week.

JULIET:
Wow. I had no idea you were so serious about bowling.

SHAWN:
Quite serious. Quite serious. As a matter of fact, Lego wants to sponsor me this year.

JULIET:
Oh, my God. That's great.

SHAWN:
They also want me to wear shoes made out of Legos. So I'm torn.

JULIET:
Okay. Well, I don't want to interrupt your practicing.

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, I should get back. I'm really not here to mess around.

KYLE comes up next to JULIET.

JULIET:
Oh, my God, I am so rude. Uh, Kyle, Shawn. Shawn, Kyle.

KYLE reaches out to shake hands.

SHAWN:
No, that's my bowling hand. (grips KYLE'S hand with his left) There you go.

JULIET:
Shawn works for the police department. He's a psychic.

KYLE:
Oh, cool, a psychic. Nice. Can you...can you tell me anything about my future?

SHAWN:
Oh, Kyle, please. That's not really how it works. (KYLE puts his arm around JULIET) Though I am...I am getting something. It's... it's hazy, but...I'm sensing that you're going to face a lot of...hmm... rejection.

KYLE:
Work-wise, or...

SHAWN:
No. No. Not work-wise. Not work-wise. You know what? I'm going to go. You kids get back to doing your thing. You know, she bowl, then you bowl, then she bowl, and you bowl. And you've got the tight tuck and it's sweet and it's perfect. See you, Jules. (leaves)

DARCY is rubbing GUS' head. He takes hold of her hands and pulls them away. He then sees SHAWN walk by.

GUS:
Okay, okay. Hold on a second. I'll be right back. Ok?

DARCY:
Ok.

GUS:
(catches up to SHAWN) Wait! Where the hell have you been?

SHAWN:
(stops) Oh, sorry. Sorry. I ran into somebody. How you doing? You okay?

GUS:
Too okay. She wants to go back to my place.

SHAWN:
Oh, this is great. We'll get all the information we need there.

GUS:
No, the problem is I told her I live at the beach.

SHAWN:
Why would you tell her that?

GUS:
I don't know. I was trying to impress her at the time. I didn't realize I was going to be dating her, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Okay, okay, okay. Let me think. Dude, I got it. You take her to my dad's place. This is perfect. Look, just give me a head start. I'll prep. I'll cover everything. Just drive slow, okay? We can do this.

GUS:
All right. Bye.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, NIGHT

HENRY comes out the front door onto the porch followed by SHAWN.

HENRY:
Shawn ...

SHAWN:
Just listen, just listen. Just hear me out. Hear me out. Listen. This might actually be fun for us.

HENRY:
What, you expect me to stand outside of my own house, in the cold, getting bitten by bugs, so Gus can score with some girl? I don't think so.

SHAWN:
Okay, first of all, not just "some girl", okay? This dame is a looker. She's a peach. She's a spicy tomato. Huh? And she may or may not be a murderer.

HENRY:
Oh, see, I knew it. I knew it. This has nothing to do with Gus finding a girl. This is about you using my house so you can conduct a sting operation. Shawn, it ain't gonna happen. (makes to move back inside)

SHAWN:
Okay, what are you doing? You're putting a negative spin on things, as usual. Look, might they have a few more obstacles than your typical couple if she turns out to be a cold-blooded killer? Sure. But what if they really fall in love, Dad?

HENRY:
Shawn, you've got about three seconds to get out of my way. One... (walks past SHAWN)

SHAWN:
That's cheating. You're cheating. No, no, Dad. (grabs HENRY by the arms and pulls him back) Shh, shh. Quiet, okay? Shut up. Shut up.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, NIGHT

GUS enters and looks around to make sure the room is clear.

GUS:
Please, come in.

SHAWN and HENRY peer through a window.

DARCY:
Oh! You lit a fire. That was fast.

GUS:
Uh... Have a seat. Welcome to my home.

DARCY:
Wow.(looks around) You really like fishing. (sits on couch next to GUS)

GUS:
No. God, no.

We see that HENRY has done the room in a fish "motif".

GUS:
I'm just playing. Yes, actually, I do love fishing. Yes. Love it. Love me some fishing. Some wide-mouth bass, some perch, some sturgeon. Whoo! Sturgeon is a fish, right?

DARCY laughs and rubs his head.

GUS:
Okay, okay.

SHAWN is leaning close over HENRY.

SHAWN:
(whispers) What is that?

HENRY:
(whispers) What?

SHAWN:
(whispers) That smell. It's like... It's like gardenia with a hint of mango.

HENRY:
(whispers) What?

SHAWN:
(whispers) Oh, my God! Did you take a bath?

HENRY:
(whispers) Yes, Shawn, I took a bath.

HENRY resumes watching GUS.

GUS:
Yes, you know, like security safes, vaults with locking devices.

SHAWN reaches a finger put and wipes something from behind HENRY'S ear.

SHAWN:
(whispers) With bubbles?

DARCY:
Are you my little safecracker?

GUS:
Well, I haven't actually cracked any safes.

HENRY wipes at his ear before turning to look at SHAWN.

HENRY:
(whispers) I don't... It's this new soap that I'm using. It... It foams more.

SHAWN:
(whispers) "It foams more"? Dad, it's called "bubble bath."

HENRY:
(whispers) I don't... It's this new soap that I'm using. It... It foams more.

SHAWN:
(whispers) "It foams more"? Dad, it's called "bubble bath."

HENRY:
(whispers) Well, I don't think it's officially called "bubble bath" if the bubbles happened accidentally, but whatever, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Who are you? Where's my father? I've accused you of being a lot of things in my lifetime, but metrosexual was never one of them.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, NIGHT

HENRY hears GUS chatting and pulls SHAWN away from the window.

HENRY:
(whispers) I am not a metrosexual. I just happen to be an average Joe who is concerned about his health and appearance. I have taken baths for years, Shawn. That is where I think. I have solved dozens and dozens of gruesome, gruesome murder cases sitting in a tub. F.Y.I., historically, real men have always taken baths.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Name one.

HENRY:
(whispers) John Wayne. Rio Bravo. Bath.

SHAWN:
(whispers) You got anybody since the Old West?

The oven bell dings.

SHAWN:
(whispers) What was...What was that?

HENRY:
(whispers) That's my roast. It's done.

SHAWN:
(whispers) You made a roast?

HENRY:
(whispers) Oh, for Christ's sakes, Shawn. It's not a quiche. It's man food. I would have gladly gone out and hunted it and killed it if I had the time. And unless you get out of my way, I am going to kill you.

SHAWN:
(whispers) You can't go in there. You'll compromise this entire investigation.

HENRY:
(whispers) The only thing compromised is my pot roast. It is drying out as we speak.

SHAWN:
Please? (HENRY brushes past him to go inside) No, Dad. No. God. (goes back to the window)

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, NIGHT

HENRY walks into the room. GUS and DARCY look at him as he passes.

HENRY:
Please, kids, pay no mind. Just passing through to the kitchen. Got to squeeze some juices on my roast. (opens the door and leaves room)

DARCY:
Gus?

GUS:
Oh, that's... Henry. He's my...my roommate. Yeah, he's just making... making a roast?

HENRY returns with a baster in his hand.

HENRY:
All done. All done. Just had to... (makes squirting sound) Okay... (leaves)

DARCY:
Look, it's fine that you have a roommate, but honestly, it's cramping our style. (rubs his chest seductively)

GUS:
It is?

DARCY:
What do you say we go somewhere more private?

GUS:
"Private" like where?

DARCY:
I know a back road that leads to a field. We could park the car...

SHAWN and HENRY watch through the window.

GUS:
(ardor cools) Uh, yeah, I don't think we should go to the field.

DARCY:
Why?

GUS:
Why? Um...

DARCY:
You don't like me. That's it, isn't it?

GUS:
No, no, my hay fever. My hay fever. The last place my nasal passages want to be is the field.

HENRY:
(whispers) No, no, no, she's not your killer, Shawn. Look in this girl's eyes, son. They're sincere.

DARCY:
You don't think I'm pretty.

GUS:
What?

DARCY:
(voice breaks) You... You just felt bad, because you... We matched up at the speed dating and you didn't know what to say, so you pretended. (rests her head on his chest and cries)

GUS:
Wow, you put all that together, huh?

HENRY:
(whispers) Those are real tears, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(whispers) You're right.

GUS looks at the window for help.

SHAWN:
That's real snot.

GUS tries to comfort DARCY.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, NIGHT

SHAWN'S cell rings and he goes away from the window to answer.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Hello? Lassie? You what? I don't... Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. (ends call) Dad... Dad, Dad, Dad. I got to go.

HENRY:
(whispers) Whoa, whoa. What do you mean, you got to go?

SHAWN:
(whispers) You got this covered.

HENRY:
(whispers) This poor girl is there, weeping on your best friend's shoulder in my house, and you're leaving? What do you do? What am I supposed to do?

SHAWN:
(whispers) I know, I know. It's a tough one. It's a real thinker. Uh... uh... I got it. Draw yourself another bath. (runs off)

HENRY:
(whispers) Shawn! Shawn!

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN is with VICK in the room looking in on the interrogation room where MARVIN is sitting at the table.

VICK:
Picked him up a couple of hours ago. Found him loitering outside one of the speed-dater's homes. When Lassiter checked his place, he found a stack of the questionnaires in his apartment.

LASSITER enters the interrogation room.

LASSITER:
Tell me about these, Marvin. (throws the questionnaires on the table)

MARVIN:
Look, I don't know anything about any crime. I just ... I used the names and the numbers to get dates, man, that's it.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM B, NIGHT

MARVIN:
I don't have 100 bucks to slap down on some entrance fee, not on my crap salary, so, yeah. And besides, that's why they go there. They go there for dates, right? So why not me?

LASSITER:
Why don't you think about that while you're trying to take a crap in front of six other guys?

MARVIN:
(sighs) Look, okay, come on, all right? All I did was I took some questionnaires out of the trash. That's it. What's the charge? "Not littering"?

LASSITER sits in the chair opposite.

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, NIGHT

MARVIN:
So if you don't have anything more, I'd like to get to work.

VICK:
Think he's telling the truth?

SHAWN:
(sees a green fingerprint on a questionnaire) Not by a long shot. Now look at him. He's not the right height. He doesn't even own a car. I mean, he can't match the tire tread. He's cocky. He thinks he's on a roll, but I'm inside his head, Chief, and I'm about to hang a Lopez around the frontal lobe and shoot right out of his nose onto his vest. You smell where I'm stepping? (nods) He had a partner. You let him go back to work, He's going to lead us right to the person. And I'll be able to pick him out, psychically. You have my word.

VICK:
I'd better. (speaks into intercom) Lassiter, let him go.

LASSITER gets up and looks into the mirror.

LASSITER:
Excuse me?

VICK:
Release him.

SHAWN:
(turns his head and looks at SHAWN instead of VICK) Release him? Why am I going to release him? (VICK knocks on the window and LASSITER turns his head) Why would I release him?

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM B, NIGHT

VICK:
Release him.

LASSITER turns away from the mirror.

LASSITER:
Fine. Why don't you get your shillelagh and get out of here?

MARVIN:
You got it.

INT. RESTAURANT, NIGHT

SHAWN, LASSITER and VICK enter the restaurant. LORRAINE approaches them.

LORRAINE:
Excuse me, may I help you people?

LASSITER:
Yeah, we're here for the speed dating event.

LORRAINE:
Oh, I'm sorry. It's already begun. Oh, wait, I remember you. Um, look, you seem like a decent fellow, and I'd hate for you to waste another $100. But I was watching you, and you're not very good at this.

LASSITER:
(holds up badge) Police business. Scat.

LORRAINE scurries off.

SHAWN:
(hands at temples, eyes closed) Okay, I need to breathe, and I need some space to do my thing.

VICK:
Okay.

VICK and LASSITER walk away. GUS arrives wearing a coral shirt with a large yellow flower in the center.

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
(turns around) Oh, good, buddy. You got the message. It's not Darcy. You're in the clear.

GUS:
(points at SHAWN) You're going to pay, Shawn. You are going to pay. Believe me.

SHAWN:
No offense, but it's tough to feel threatened by you when you're wearing that shirt. Is that a hibiscus?

GUS:
It's not my shirt, Shawn. It's your dad's shirt. He had to loan me one because mine was covered in snot tears.

SHAWN:
I can't... Did you know he also takes bubble baths?

GUS:
So did John Wayne.

SHAWN:
I know, but can you name one other guy?

GUS:
What's going on?

SHAWN:
I solved the case. It's actually got a decent twist. Have a seat.

SHAWN goes up to the area set aside for the speed dating while GUS sits down by the bar.

MAN 1:
Well, I'm actually kind of an adventurist. You know, I was caught in an avalanche once and in order to survive, I drank my own urine and I ate three of my toes, which is, you know, maybe why you saw me limp when I came in.

The WOMAN is less than impressed by this story. SHAWN comes over to the table.

SHAWN:
Hey, big guy. You mind if I cut in here?

MAN 1:
Oh, I don't know. We're kind of in a...

SHAWN:
You're going to be okay.(pats him on the back)

MAN 1:
Okay. All right. (gets up and leaves)

SHAWN:
(sits) Gee, I really hope that wasn't rude. It seemed a little rude.

WOMAN 2:
Well, actually, I should thank you, because he was awful.

SHAWN'S eye moves to the table behind the WOMAN where GLENDA is seated.

GLENDA:
That is a very nice name.

WOMAN 2:
...but you're kind of cute.

GLENDA'S gaze falls on MARVIN who is leaning close to another woman. He leaves when he realizes she is looking at him.

GLENDA:
So, navy blue is your favorite color?  Mine's green.

SHAWN zooms in on GLENDA'S hand and sees a circle of pale skin on her ring finger.

GLENDA:
You know, you seem European. You sure you don't have family history there?

SHAWN notices the same mark on MARVIN.

GLENDA:
What's your mother's maiden name?

WOMAN 2:
So after volunteering for the animal shelter, I decided...

SHAWN:
Can I just... Can I stop you for a moment? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. (stands and taps on glass) Uh, everybody? I'm sorry, if I could just get your attention for a sec here. I'm sorry.

JULIET arrives and stands with GUS, VICK and LASSITER by the bar.

SHAWN:
(to WOMAN 2) I want to pick this up right where we left off if there's any time left on the clock, okay? Because you seem like a terrific person. You deserve someone special. Someone who makes you feel safe, but also a little dirty, you know what I'm talking about? (begins to walk among the tables) Everyone deserves someone special, each and every one of you. All of you. Look, is your perfect match here tonight? I don't know. I'm not sure. But the point is, you're here, and you put your hearts on the line, and that's all that really matters. Unfortunately, there are two people here that do not share your pure desires. They're not here to find their soul mates. They're not here to fall in love. As a matter of fact, they're not even single. You, Glenda, (points) and you, Marvin, (points) are a couple. An odd couple, to be sure, but a couple. Matter of fact, you're married!

GLENDA:
This is absurd!

SHAWN:
The tan lines on your fingers where your wedding rings used to be will prove...

VICK:
Please, not with the tanning thing again.

SHAWN:
...that not only are you married, but that tanning had something to do with this investigation. Thank you, Chief. Now, the question is why would a married couple infiltrate a singles event? Well, the answer is simple. It's a perfect place to commit their crime. They're here to rob you, ladies and gentlemen. To steal from you the one thing that is invariably your own. Identity.

LASSITER:
I told you that leprechaun was bad.

SHAWN:
Marvin did copy the questionnaires to get these people's phone numbers and addresses. And you, Glenda, cleverly found the answers to questions like "What's your mother's maiden name?" "What's your favorite color?" "Did you have any pets? What are their names?" "Name all the Bee-Gees." Those are the same questions that you get at the bank from security when you try to authorize a credit card. So, what was left? Get the credit card numbers from these poor guys without them knowing they were robbed. So you came up with a plan. You followed them, you drugged them. You took down the numbers  and you deposited them naked in a field where they woke up disoriented, grassy-assed, but none the wiser. Fred Turk did see a little alien that day, except it wasn't an extraterrestrial. It was Marvin in his ridiculous, stupid green leprechaun costume. And they would have gotten away with it, too, folks, if it wasn't for their last victim. The one who didn't quite wake up.

GUS:
(whispers) I'm going to work it from the outside.

MARVIN makes a run for it but is stopped by LASSITER. At the same time, GLENDA tries to get away but SHAWN blocks her.

SHAWN:
Not so fast! Because that isn't even the worst of it. The worst of it is that you two stole a very valuable seat that belonged to a single person. A single person who believes in the power of love. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Both of you.

VICK escorts GLENDA out while LASSITER takes MARVIN. LORRAINE rings the bell.

LORRAINE:
Murder, wow. That's a speed dating first. Be sure to check up at the bar and see who you match from your questionnaires, okay? (rings the bell)

The daters begin to file out. SHAWN smiles and sits down at the table with WOMAN 2.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry about that.

WOMAN 2:
Wow.

SHAWN:
You know? I just... It was from here, though. (taps chest) You know that. So we were talking about what? We were talking about...

WOMAN 2:
Beagles.

SHAWN:
That's so sweet, because you like them, and you put little sweaters on them.

WOMAN 2:
Yeah, well, sometimes.

JULIET comes over to the table.

JULIET:
Excuse me, sorry. May I cut in?

SHAWN:
It's my...parole officer.

WOMAN 2:
Oh.

SHAWN:
Yeah.

WOMAN 2:
Okay.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry.

WOMAN 2:
Sure. (leaves)

JULIET sits down.

JULIET:
Sorry.

SHAWN:
Where did you... I thought you...I thought you were on a date.

JULIET:
I was. It's over.

SHAWN:
Over?

JULIET:
Mmm-hmm.

SHAWN:
"Over" like "he laid one on you on the front porch, and you got little butterflies" over? Or "you pretended like you had a headache and called it quits early" over?

JULIET:
Not that it's any of your business, but he can't bowl. And that's the deal-breaker.

SHAWN:
I see.

JULIET:
Hmm. But look, the only reason I sat down is because I wanted to clear one thing up. I don't take any stock in those profile-matching thingies we did the other night.

SHAWN:
Jules, I was just messing around. I... I copied your card over your shoulders. Like verbatim. You thought maybe I sew my own pajamas? That's...

JULIET:
Right, okay. Well, good, because, um, I don't want there to be any weirdness between us, and it seems like we're going to be working together a lot.

SHAWN:
All the time.

JULIET:
Yeah. So, nice job on the case, by the way.

SHAWN:
Thank you very much.

JULIET:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Thank you.

JULIET:
Okay, all right, I'll see you at work. (stands)

SHAWN:
That's how we do it.

JULIET:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Work-style.

JULIET:
(stops and turns around) See you at work.

SHAWN:
See you.

JULIET leaves and SHAWN thinks over the exchange. GUS joins him.

GUS:
Where's she going?

SHAWN:
You know what, I think... I think I undersold the fajitas.

GUS reaches for the snack foods on the table.

GUS:
Well, wouldn't be the first time a female walked out on you in the middle of a meal.

SHAWN:
Oh, please, Gus, we're talking about Jules here. It's not like we were on a date. Plus, it wouldn't work out. It would never work out. I'd have to really bowl well. And apparently that's a deal-breaker.(chuckles)

GUS sniffs the food.

SHAWN:
You know how awful those are.

GUS:
I'm hungry, man.

SHAWN:
Dude, jerk chicken.

GUS:
Oh, you know that's right.

They leave.

Episode 1x12 Cloudy,,,Chance of Murder

1985

INT. COURTROOM, DAY

SHAWN and HENRY are sitting behind the railed divider watching a case. HENRY is in uniform and SHAWN is wearing a button-down long-sleeve shirt with a tie.

SHAWN:
Dad, why do this people get better seats than us?

HENRY:
(leans over) Shawn, those people aren't just watching the trial. Those people are the trial. They're the jurors and they are the most important people in this room.

SHAWN:
They are?

HENRY:
The thing about the jury is, Shawn, you got to learn how to look at them, how to read them. For instance, take a look at Juror Number Five. He's the guy in the front row, second one from the left. Tell me what you see. Go.

SHAWN:
(studies the man) Brown shirt. Little hole in his collar. His coat is too tight on him. He's got rough hands. He's looking down, mostly, and nodding a lot.

HENRY:
Good, good. All right, let's take that hole in his collar. Now, would Mom ever let you leave the house looking like that?

SHAWN:
Never.

HENRY:
You believe it. So that tells us that he's probably not married. That's called deductive reasoning.

LAWYER:
Your Honor, the people call Detective Henry L. Spencer to the stand.

HENRY:
All right. Watch closely, kid. One day, you're going to walk up the steps of this courthouse. You're going to make your old man proud. (taps SHAWN on the chin)

PRESENT DAY

EXT. COURTHOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS head up the front steps.

SHAWN:
Gus, they impounded my motorcycle without warning.

GUS:
I'm pretty sure the warning was the $900 worth of parking tickets you racked up.

SHAWN:
Still, man, you can't take a man's means of transportation away. It's unconstitutional or something.

GUS:
I'm pretty sure it's not in the Constitution.

SHAWN:
(stops) Oh, don't be so sure. I think it says, "Thou shalt not something or covet something. Don't mess with Texas or the right of transportation."

GUS:
You're thinking of a Commandment.

SHAWN:
That's even better.

GUS:
Can we just pay this ticket so we can get out of here, please?

INT. COURTHOUSE, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk through the halls.

GUS:
You've got to be kidding me. We came all the way over here, and now you're not going to wait in the line?

SHAWN:
Gus, did you see it in there? It's a ticket payment line, not Space Mountain. Hardly worth it. Plus, I don't wait in lines.

GUS:
What do you mean, you don't wait in lines? Everyone waits in lines. That's all we do as people. We wait in lines.

SHAWN:
I don't. It's not in my nature.

GUS:
That makes no sense, Shawn.

GUS' cellphone rings and he reaches into his jacket pocket.

SHAWN:
You remember the story of the scorpion and the frog? They're both on the river bank. The scorpion's like "Hey"...

GUS:
(answers phone) Burton Guster.

While SHAWN is on the phone, SHAWN looks down the hall and sees a woman stop to pick up some trash from the floor and throw it away before looking back and continuing with her lawyer. She smiles at SHAWN as they pass.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS sorts the mail as they enter the office.

SHAWN:
The point is I shouldn't have gotten any tickets, Gus. I was using my ambassador plates.

GUS:
Ambassador plates? You're not an ambassador, Shawn. Impersonating a government official will land you in jail.

SHAWN:
I am an ambassador, of sorts. I am a Goodwill Ambassador to Paraguay.

GUS:
To where?

SHAWN:
Paraguay. It is an honorary title that I received after overseeing all sand castle construction at a South American Club Med.

GUS:
(takes off jacket and turns on TV) You never worked at Club Med.

SHAWN:
(sits and looks at TV) Ooh, turn that up.

On the TV a man is being interviewed. He is the prosecuting attorney, PHELPS. Underneath him, the banner reads "School Marm Murderer?".

PHELPS:
Someone we know, someone we love, Someone we invited into our living rooms...

SHAWN:
I just saw that woman at the courthouse.

GUS:
That's Sandra Panitch, the fourth grade teacher who murdered Jackson Hale. Don't you watch the news?

SHAWN:
(eats pineapple chunks) I can't watch channel 8 anymore. Lloyd Lansing wears a toupee. It's like every newscast starts with a lie.

GUS:
I can't stand this guy. Something about him just irks me. Listen to him. (turns up volume)

PHELPS:
Sandra Panitch went with weatherman Jackson Hale to his channel 8 news studio, engaged in sexual relations with him, and then stabbed him in the heart with a letter opener. She fled the scene, but not without leaving behind a mountain of physical evidence, including a trail of the victim's blood and her fingerprints all over the murder weapon. This is why the state is going after murder one.

SHAWN:
But she didn't do it.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Gus, I'm getting a very strong feeling here. I think that woman is innocent.

GUS:
I do watch the news, and I've been following this case. They have a mountain of evidence against this lady. Look, they call her the "School Marm Murderer."

SHAWN:
First of all, there's a question mark at the end of that. They call her the "School Marm Murderer"? Even the newspeople aren't convinced. And today, at the courthouse, in the middle of a conversation, I saw her bend over and pick up a piece of trash.

GUS:
Oh, I see. So because she picks up somebody's Kit-Kat wrapper means she didn't kill anybody? That makes sense.

SHAWN:
Gus, she didn't have to do that. The woman is about to be on trial for her life. She takes time out for common courtesy? That is not the mindset of a cold-blooded murder. No! (stands) This is what I know. (moves to the front of his desk and sits in a chair facing GUS) She looked at me right in the eyes. Now, there are a lot of tells that people have when they are trying to appear not guilty. (demonstrates) The way that they sit, eye lines to inanimate objects, twitching, itching, rubbing. All of these affectations, I am an expert on all of them. But there's one thing that you cannot change, no matter how hard you try, (stands and points to his eyes) and that is the tent on the windows to the soul.

SHAWN looks at the TV where the man he had seen in the hall with SANDRA PANITCH is being hounded by the press. He tries to ignore them, but finally gives in and talks to them. SHAWN watches as he talks.

HORNSTOCK:
(on TV) Adam Hornstock, attorney for the defense. Sandra Panitch is a victim of circumstance, of being in the wrong place at the wrong time...

SHAWN:
Oh, no. Look at this poor guy. Look. He's hunched over. He's not making eye contact. And look at the handkerchief in the left pocket there. It's not decorative, Gus. That's crumpled and stained. That's used for dabbing sweat a lot. Her lawyer's a beaten man. Whether he knows it or not, Adam Hornstock needs us.

GUS:
What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
Dude, we're going to be legal consultants. It's awesome.

INT. COURTHOUSE, HALL OUTSIDE COURTROOM B EAST HALL, DAY

There is a crowd of reporters outside the courtroom where the Panitch trial is to be held. A GUARD is holding them at bay as SHAWN and GUS arrive.

SHAWN:
Let's get in there and grab seats.

GUS:
Do you think that court officer is guarding the door for his health?

SHAWN:
Just roll with me on this. (pushes his way through)  Excuse me, people. Coming through. Shawn Spencer here. Spencer. That's S-P-E-N-C-E-R. This is my partner, Burton Guster. G-U... Look, I know I have been reluctant to go on record about this trial up to this point...

REPORTER:
I'm sorry. Who are you?

SHAWN:
What is this, Journalism 101? I give my statement. You berate me with your rudimentary Q & A later. In fact, you two, switch places.

SHAWN has the male reporter trade places with a young blonde female reporter.

GUS:
(helps the woman) Yeah. Excuse me.

SHAWN:
Come on. Don't be shy. He puts his pants on one leg at a time.

GUS:
I do.

SHAWN:
As I was saying, this trial is not about a particular case. It is about our rights as citizens. No one, and I mean no one, should ever wake up, and, I don't know, let's say, find that their motorcycle has been taken away from them. As this trial moves forward, I will have more to say. That is all. Thank you.

REPORTER:
Motorcycle? Whose motorcycle are we talking about here? Did the defendant ride a motorcycle?

SHAWN motions to the GUARD for his help.

GUARD:
Guys, please, please. Give them their space.

INT. COURTHOUSE, COURTROOM B EAST HALL, DAY

The courtroom is packed. SHAWN and GUS have managed to get seats behind the defense. The JUDGE is becoming impatient with HORNSTOCK.

JUDGE:
Are we ready yet, Mr. Hornstock?

HORNSTOCK:
(stands) Oh, yes. Just one moment, sir. Ah! (looks through notes)

GUS:
You know, I was pre-law once. Maybe I should've stuck with it.

SHAWN:
You were never pre-law.

GUS:
Well, I was pre-pre-law. Sixth grade, but it was an accelerated program. I won a mock trial of Tortoise VS Hare.

SHAWN:
The hare did it.

GUS:
Of course he did.

They fist-bump. SHAWN notices that one of the female jurors changes positions in her seat and checks her reflection in a compact mirror.

JUDGE:
The court will take a short recess, and then, perhaps, Mr. Hornstock, we can get going with these proceedings. (bangs gavel)

SHAWN:
Dude, we're so hired.

GUS:
We are?

SHAWN:
Watch this. (walks up to HORNSTOCK) Excuse me. Mr. Hornstock, right? You don't know me. My name's Shawn Spencer. I'm the lead psychic detective at the SBPD.

HORNSTOCK:
Uh, yeah, um, I'm a little busy right now. (bends over notes)

SHAWN:
I can see. You're doing a bang-up job. Please don't stop. I just... I think maybe you should be a little careful.

HORNSTOCK:
Of?

SHAWN:
(whispers) Of juror number four. (holds four fingers up against his chest)

HORNSTOCK:
Juror...  (straightens) Oh, yeah? Why is that?

SHAWN:
Something about you really bothers her.

HORNSTOCK:
I think something about her bothers me. She's been frowning at me the whole time and I haven't even gone up yet.

SHAWN:
Here's the thing, She's a fashion maven. She has a problem with your appearance, and until you change it, I don't think she's going to listen to a word you say.

HORNSTOCK:
My appearance?

SHAWN:
The manner in which you appear. Your "look." I don't know exactly what the problem is but let's check it out. Why don't you give me the...Give me the 360 cat dance real fast, huh? (claps)

HORNSTOCK:
Excuse me?

SHAWN:
Twirl it up for me, and then twirl it right back.

With a scoff, HORNSTOCK twists his waist and turns back to face SHAWN.

SHAWN:
There it is. And back. Suit, pleated. I would've gone with a three-button, maybe something in a wool-cotton blend, but I don't think that's the problem. Sideburns? Check. Hair, bold. Strokes, hives...I don't think that's the problem. The shoes, not a spit shine, but you haven't gotten up yet, so I can't make heads or...Whoa! (fingers HORNSTOCK'S tie)

HORNSTOCK:
What?

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I think it's the tie.

HORNSTOCK:
What? My tie? What's wrong with my tie?

SHAWN:
Well, it's a little bit... (blows through his lips)

HORNSTOCK imitates SHAWN and SHAWN repeats himself.

HORNSTOCK:
(takes back his tie) Well, look, it's not, like, my favorite tie... (tucks tie under his jacket)

SHAWN:
I'm so glad to hear you say that. (leans over) Gus?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(whispers) Quick, give me your tie.

GUS:
(whispers) I'm not giving you my tie! It's a good tie!

SHAWN:
(whispers) Give me the tie, please.

GUS:
(whispers) It's a Thomas Pink tie.

SHAWN:
(to HORNSTOCK) One second. (leans back to GUS and whispers forcefully) Why won't you give me the tie? Just once will you...

GUS:
(undoes tie as he whispers) Come on, Shawn! (throws tie at him)

SHAWN:
(to HORNSTOCK) Look high, reach low. (slips him the tie)

HORNSTOCK:
Got it.

SHAWN:
Now we're also going to take this. (takes handkerchief from HORNSTOCK'S pocket) Primarily because it's covered in sweat, but also because it reads "cruise ship waiter" to me.

HORNSTOCK:
Cruise ship?

SHAWN:
(playfully slaps HORNSTOCK on the butt) Go get 'em.

SHAWN goes back to his seat as HORNSTOCK loosens his tie and sits.

>>>LATER>>>

HORNSTOCK now wears GUS' bright blue tie.

HORNSTOCK:
And so I will demonstrate to the court that Sandra Panitch is an upstanding citizen with no criminal record, and the district attorney has rushed to the prosecution of an innocent woman.

HORNSTOCK looks over at Juror 4 who is now paying attention.

JUDGE:
Are you finished now, Mr. Hornstock?

HORNSTOCK:
Hmm? Oh, yes. Yes, your Honor.

JUDGE:
Brilliant. Well, things are finally moving along. Court will recess till after lunch. (bangs gavel)

As the courtroom clears, an excited HORNSTOCK goes over to SHAWN and GUS.

HORNSTOCK:
Did you see that? That was amazing. Did you see that? That was a whole 180.

GUS:
It's a pretty amazing tie.

SHAWN:
Hey, strong shag, strong tie, strong person.

HORNSTOCK:
Uh, you know, guys, I would hire you in a second. It's just... Well, I...I don't have the authorization. My firm doesn't really believe in...

SHAWN:
Winning?

HORNSTOCK:
No.

SHAWN:
Mermaids?

HORNSTOCK:
No.

SHAWN:
The minotaur.

HORNSTOCK:
No, me. Yeah, uh... at least, not anymore.

SHAWN:
No, there's no "buts" here. A lot of the cases my partner Gus and I take we do for free.

GUS:
It's called "pro bono."

SHAWN:
Gus.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
A little decorum. We're in a courtroom. Congratulations. You've got yourself a couple of legal consultants.

SHAWN holds out his fist for a bump, but HORNSTOCK, not knowing what it's for, wraps his hand around SHAWN's fist and shakes it. SHAWN looks down at it.

GUS:
Wow.

SHAWN:
Oh, boy.

INT. COURTHOUSE, HALL OUTSIDE COURTROOM B EAST HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS leave the courtroom still discussing HORNSTOCK. JULIET and LASSITER are ahead of them.

GUS:
Did he just grab your fist?

SHAWN:
And then he shook it. (sees the detectives) Well, well, well. What do we have here? Hi, Jules. Please tell me you're not one of those courtroom groupies that bounces from trial to trial? Wait a second, was that you at the Michael Jackson hearing with the sequined glove and the shirt that said, "Please free the man in the mirror"?

JULIET:
That's actually really funny, Shawn. Detective Lassiter is the one who actually made the arrest of Sandra Panitch.

LASSITER:
See, that makes it my case.

SHAWN:
What a coincidence. It's also our case. Yeah, we just signed on as legal consultants to the defense just now.

LASSITER:
You will sell your little sideshow act to anyone who will listen. (leans in) Just don't screw this one up.

LASSITER and JULIET walk away.

SHAWN:
(softly to GUS) "Don't screw this up?" (calls after LASSITER) Hey, Lassie, that really wasn't much of a putdown. In fact, it was somewhat inspiring. Lass! Let's roll that back!

INT. HORNSTOCK, HORNSTOCK, BEIDERMAN & HORNSTOCK, OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and HORNSTOCK are in an office. SHAWN is sitting behind the desk, spinning in the leather chair. HORNSTOCK is standing nervously by the door while GUS sits in one of the chairs in front of the desk.

SHAWN:
I don't know. It feels a little weird. I mean, you should really be sitting here. This is your office. (puts his feet up on the desk)

HORNSTOCK:
Uh, yeah, this isn't my office. You didn't like my mine. This is Carter Jarecki's office, one of the partners. Actually, he's the guy who took the case in the first place, but then dumped it on me when he decided it was a lost cause.

SHAWN:
You see, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Why didn't you stand up to that guy?

HORNSTOCK:
For the worst reason possible. I actually believe this woman is innocent. Now, can we please go before Jarecki gets back?

SHAWN:
(sees wedding ring in dish by door) Carter Jarecki just left for a nooner with his mistress. We have at least two hours. (sees a photo of a heavyset man with his family on the desk) Maybe an hour and a half.

HORNSTOCK falls into the other chair next to GUS.

SHAWN:
Hornstock, I think you have the potential to be a fantastic lawyer. You just need confidence. After all, that's your name on the door. Now, come on!

HORNSTOCK:
Oh, no. No, none of those Hornstocks are me. The first one is my grandfather, he founded the firm. The other one is my father, then my brother.

GUS:
Wow. A whole family of lawyers?

HORNSTOCK:
Yeah, even my sister.

SHAWN:
Well, there you go. She didn't make the door.

HORNSTOCK:
She's Biederman. It's her married name.

GUS:
Well, we're going to need to take a look at your witness lists and your deposition transcripts.

HORNSTOCK:
Oh, yeah, well, I've prepared all that for you. I have, uh... (pulls out a thick file folder) Here are all the forensic and arrest reports. (hands it to GUS) And I deposed several of Hale's co-workers from channel 8, mostly to refute time lines and for character testimony.

GUS:
Can we see those?

HORNSTOCK:
Sure, yeah. Here's... (hands GUS a thick binder and puts another on the desk in front of SHAWN)

SHAWN:
(chuckles) Oh, yes, and maybe later on we can read the phone book just for fun. (stands) Hornstock, I have got to do what I do. And that's not the way I do it. I need to see, feel, and smell people in order to figure out what happened.

HORNSTOCK:
Smell them?

INT. CHANNEL 8, STUDIO, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are shown in by PRISCILLA, the station's receptionist.

PRISCILLA:
So this is where the, uh, the crime took place. So just feel free to have a look around, and do whatever it is you do.

GUS:
Okay.

SHAWN:
Thank you. Let's walk the crime, shall we?

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
(points) Probably came in from that same entrance we did.

GUS:
Right.

SHAWN:
(walk in front of the desk) Found their way over here to the channel 8 anchor desk area.(walk to the green screen) Of course, the body was found... here. It was a short walk.

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Priscilla, what are these green walls for?

PRISCILLA:
Oh, well, we do it all in green screen.

SHAWN:
Really? Can you show me how that works, please?

PRISCILLA:
Sure. I just need someone to sit in front.

SHAWN:
Gus, go sit over there.

GUS:
I'm not going to sit there just because you tell me to Shawn.

SHAWN:
Fine. I'll play anchorman. (makes to go sit at the desk)

GUS:
(stops him) I got it. I got it. (goes to the desk)

PRISCILLA:
Okay, so we just have to go to the control room. It's just this way.

SHAWN follows PRISCILLA as GUS makes himself comfortable behind the desk, even performing vocal exercises.

INT. CHANNEL 8, CONTROL ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is talking to one of the technicians.

SHAWN:
You know when we're watching the weather guy and it looks like he's got... like, rainfall behind him? Or snow or hail? How does that work?

TECH:
Well, the green background works as a blank slate. Then I just run it through the board, (presses buttons) and presto! A composite of the two images is made.

SHAWN watches on the monitor as GUS appears to have an avalanche behind him. SHAWN realizes GUS is talking.

SHAWN:
Oh, oh, oh. Can we get sound in here?

TECH:
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

GUS:
(over monitor) In local news a pharmaceutical representative again provided the key piece of information in a baffling police case.

SHAWN:
(switches on microphone) But ran screaming from the scene like a little girl before he could make a statement.

GUS:
That was one time, Shawn! One time! I don't like dead bodies. I told you that. Now, stop bringing that up. Hello. This is your local news.

INT. CHANNEL 8, HALL, DAY

PRISCILLA leads them along the hall.

PRISCILLA:
This next office was Jackson Hale's. I got to tell you guys, everybody's been acting a little weird since it happened. It's just not the same.

INT. CHANNEL 8, HALE'S OFFICE, DAY

PRISCILLA stops in the doorway. There is a man on the floor going through HALE'S things. He puts a video tape into the player.

PRISCILLA:
Ruben, this is Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster. They're working on Jackson Hale's case. This is Ruben Leonard. He's a lab meteorologist on Jackson's team.

RUBEN:
Was. (sits in desk chair) I was just sorting and packing some of his more important things to send to his family. It's the least I can do.

SHAWN:
That's very thoughtful.

RUBEN:
Thank you.

The TV is playing one of HALE'S forecasts.

PRISCILLA:
Would you excuse me?

SHAWN:
Sure.

GUS:
Sure.

PRISCILLA leaves.

GUS:
Did you work with Jackson Hale long?

RUBEN:
Six years. He was a great man. I had a lot of respect for him.

SHAWN sees certificates ripped in the garbage and broken pieces of trophies on the floor.

RUBEN:
He was just so good at what he did. A broadcasting treasure.

SHAWN looks at GUS and points to the door.

GUS:
Yeah.

They leave the room.

INT. CHANNEL 8, HALL, DAY

SHAWN stops away from the office.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Dude, Ruben's in there destroying Hale's awards.

GUS:
(whispers) What?

SHAWN:
(whispers) Yeah. Unless he's really offended by the shoddy engraving on the plaque, that guy hates Jackson Hale. I'm not saying he did it, but reasonable doubt, anyone?

INT. COURTHOUSE, INTERVIEW ROOM, DAY

On the table are evidence photos of SANDRA with bruises on her arms. She is sitting next to HORNSTOCK. SHAWN is sitting on the opposite side of the table wearing a jacket. GUS walks the room.

GUS:
Okay, Ms. Panitch. Please, walk us through the night of the crime.

SANDRA:
Well, I never met Mr. Hale before that night. I just moved here from Wisconsin. It wasn't like I was a fan of his. I only vaguely knew he was a weatherman. So we talked, and he was charming...

GUS:
So the scratches on Jackson Hale's back, and his skin under your fingernails, this all happened during the sex as well as the bruises on your arm?

SANDRA:
It got passionate. I don't remember anything until I woke up the next morning.

GUS:
With his blood on you? And then you fled to the parking lot?

SANDRA:
Look, I was scared.

SHAWN looks at GUS as if to question his tack in questioning.

SANDRA:
I... I know how bad all of this looks, I do. But I swear I did not murder anyone. Do you guys believe me? (looks at GUS) Do you?

SHAWN:
Of course we do, Sandra. Don't be ridiculous. (to GUS) Counselor?

GUS:
Yes?

SHAWN:
(stands) Would you please retire with me to the hallway where we can exchange words in hushed tones?

SHAWN leaves the room and GUS follows.

INT. COURTHOUSE, HALL, DAY

SHAWN:
Okay, what are you doing?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
You are supposed to be demonstrating confidence and swagger for Hornstock. Instead, you're poking holes in our case and you're scaring our defendant.

GUS:
Here are the facts, Shawn. All we know about Sandra is what she has told us. I think we need to do some investigating.

SHAWN:
I believe her. Hornstock believes her. What else do we need?

GUS:
We need proof, Shawn. (shows legal tome) Look, right here in this book, Corey VS Bolevicker in 1955. The key piece of evidence was half-melted candlesticks. We need evidence. Where are our candlesticks, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Maybe you just jumped over them.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Be nimble? Be quick? You're not going to give me anything for that? Now, can we please... (sees the JUDGE walking down the hall, hand on his back) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Check out the judge. He's grabbing his back. No wonder he's so grumpy.

GUS:
He's not grabbing his back. He's grabbing his kidneys. He probably has a kidney stone.

SHAWN:
Dude, nice!

GUS:
Thank you.

INT. COURTHOUSE, COURTROOM B EAST HALL, DAY

The trial has resumed and HORNSTOCK is questioning PRISCILLA. SHAWN is sitting with SANDRA.

HORNSTOCK:
Please state to the court what your relationship with Mr. Hale was.

PRISCILLA:
It was professional. He was my boss. I was his receptionist.

HORNSTOCK:
And as the channel 8 receptionist, Ms. Osterman, if people were to call Jackson Hale, you took those calls?

PRISCILLA:
I did.

HORNSTOCK:
And did you receive any calls from the defendant, Sandra Panitch, at any time?

PRISCILLA:
Oh, not to my knowledge, no.

HORNSTOCK:
But other women would call?

PRISCILLA:
Sure.

HORNSTOCK:
Was Jackson Hale sleeping with these women?

PHELPS:
Objection, your Honor. Hearsay.

JUDGE:
I'll allow the question.

PRISCILLA:
Uh, well, I can only say that I fielded many calls, and sometimes I helped to juggle these calls. He was a handsome man.

HORNSTOCK:
He certainly was. Thank you, Ms. Osterman. (sits next to SHAWN)

JUDGE:
You may step down, Ms. Osterman.

PRISCILLA:
Thanks. (steps down from the stand)

PHELPS:
Your Honor, the state requests a moment to prepare for our next witness.

SHAWN:
"He certainly was"? What happened? You were rolling.

HORNSTOCK:
I don't know. I don't know. It sounded good in my head. You have a great support system, you know it gives you that easy confidence. But my father hasn't been to court once, not one of my trials. You've been here one day, your father's already here.

SHAWN:
What are you talking about?

HORNSTOCK:
Oh, I met him outside. He's a really nice guy.

SHAWN turns his head to look for HENRY and finally spots him. HENRY waves. SHAWN turns back.

SHAWN:
Your Honor, the defense would like to call for a recess.

JUDGE:
Excuse me. Who are you?

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, your Honor. (stands) My name is Shawn Spencer. I'm a psychic legal consultant on this case.

PHELPS:
(stands) Objection, your Honor. We were not made aware that a psychic was hired on this case.

JUDGE:
Approach the bench. All of you.

HORNSTOCK stands and SHAWN puts a hand on his back as they approach the bench.

SHAWN:
Sweet.

SHAWN, HORNSTOCK and PHELPS stand in front of the JUDGE.

PHELPS:
(points at SHAWN) Your Honor, the people question his validity.

SHAWN:
Okay, first of all, that's hurtful. Look, I know you're the big, bad prosecutor with the sweet head, but is this tone really necessary? No. I am a legitimate consultant. I have been hired often by the Santa Barbara Police Department, and there is a high-ranking detective in this very courtroom right now. who will vouch for my validity.

JUDGE:
Who is this?

SHAWN:
He's right there. (points at LASSITER) The wispy yet commanding Irish fellow who looks like he's been sucking on Sour Patch Kids.

JUDGE:
Would you stand and state your name for the court?

LASSITER:
(stands) Carlton Lassiter, Santa Barbara Police Department, your Honor. Head detective, 11 years this May.

JUDGE:
Perhaps you'd like to inform the court of your favorite color as well. The point is do you know this man?

LASSITER:
I do.

JUDGE:
And has he worked on cases for the department?

LASSITER:
He has.

SHAWN:
(slaps his hand on bench) There you have it.

JUDGE:
And he was helpful?

LASSITER:
Absolutely. (sits)

SHAWN:
(turns to stenographer) Did he just say absolutely with a little half-smile? I'd like that printed out, please. I'm thinking of shellacking it on a nice piece of maple, maybe doing a little decoupage. Your Honor, as you can see, I'm responsible for breaking many cases here in the state of California.

JUDGE:
Well, guess what? I don't care who you are or what you've done for the state. I don't believe in that psychic mumbo-jumbo, and it's not welcome in my court.

SHAWN:
"Mumbo-Jumbo"? (gasps) Oh! You poor, poor man. No wonder. You're... (whispers) Passing a kidney stone can be very stressful.

JUDGE:
Who told you that? I never told anyone.

SHAWN:
You tell me if I'm overstepping my bounds, but, I'd like to suggest an old home remedy that did wonders for my Aunt Delores. You simply gargle with some mineral water, followed up with some raw greens. Me, personally, I'd go with asparagus tips. That way, later on, when you're making water, you'll know that it's working.

The JUDGE raises his gavel and is about to bang it, but changes his mind.

JUDGE:
Let's proceed with the trial.

INT. COURTHOUSE, HALL, DAY

HENRY is up against the wall, cell phone to his ear. SHAWN walks up, takes the phone away and walks into an available room. HENRY follows him.

INT. COURTHOUSE, ROOM, DAY

SHAWN:
Okay, you got me. I'm startled. What are you doing here?

HENRY:
Well, maybe we're both psychics. (wiggles fingers in an imitation of a vision)

SHAWN:
I am serious.

HENRY:
Occasionally I come down here, I sit in on a trial. Today, I get a phone call. "Guess who's practicing law now?"

SHAWN:
Wait a minute. You come down here regularly?

HENRY:
Thursdays, usually. Today was just a bonus.

SHAWN:
My God, you just can't let go, can you? You retired too early. Not my fault. I didn't ask you to turn in your badge, Dad.

HENRY:
Shawn! Shawn! Shawn!

SHAWN:
I'm in there trying to do something...

HENRY:
You seem to forget whose name you got at the end of your letterhead, kid. When you use my name, it is my business as well. Give me my phone. (SHAWN gives him the phone and HENRY heads out the door) Took you long enough to figure out the kidney stone.

INT. COURTHOUSE, COURTROOM B EAST HALL, DAY

The prosecution is questioning RUBEN on the stand.

PHELPS:
Let it be noted that the witness identified the defendant, Sandra Panitch, as the woman he saw running through the parking lot on the night of the murder.

One of his assistants comes up and whispers in PHELPS' ear.

PHELPS:
(whispers) Has it been authenticated?

SHAWN:
(to HORNSTOCK) Hey, what would Phelps need to get authenticated?

HORNSTOCK:
(sighs) I don't know. His little collection of green army men?

SHAWN:
H-Stock, did you just make a joke?

HORNSTOCK:
Hmm?

SHAWN:
I think you did.

HORNSTOCK chuckles.

PHELPS:
Your witness.

JUDGE:
Does the defense wish to cross-examine?

HORNSTOCK:
(stands) Your Honor, the defense rests.

SHAWN:
(coughs) No. No it doesn't.

HORNSTOCK:
Your Honor, the defense may rest.(leans over)(to SHAWN) Why am I not resting?

SHAWN:
(whispers) I have a vibe that's very strong. Hatred, jealousy. That guy wanted to be a serious weatherman. He has no sympathy for Jackson Hale whatsoever.

HORNSTOCK:
Wait. What? You think he did it?

SHAWN:
No, I'm pretty sure he didn't.

HORNSTOCK:
But we can plant a seed.

SHAWN:
Johnny Applestock.

HORNSTOCK:
(stands) Your Honor, the defense does not rest. (walks over to stand) Mr. Leonard, you are a meteorologist, are you not?

RUBEN:
Yes, I am indeed.

HORNSTOCK:
But not on the air?

RUBEN:
No, not on the air.

HORNSTOCK:
Maybe because you don't have a meteorologist's name.

RUBEN:
I don't follow.

HORNSTOCK:
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but "Leonard" isn't a term for any kind of weather?

RUBEN:
No, it is not.

SHAWN gets an idea and looks for a paper to write on.

HORNSTOCK:
So, if I was to look up "Leonard" in, say, a weather glossary, there would be no definition?

RUBEN:
No, there would not. Um, excuse me...where is this going?

SHAWN writes furiously.

JUDGE:
Yes, Mr. Hornstock, where are you going with this?

HORNSTOCK:
I'm sorry, your Honor. It's just that every successful weatherman that I know of has a real weatherman's name. Johnny Mountain, Dallas Raines? Oh, Jackson Hale, for example.

SHAWN tries to pass his note to HORNSTOCK.

RUBEN:
Okay, first of all, that wasn't even his real name.

HORNSTOCK:
Precisely! Have you ever considered going by the name of Bolt Lightning?

RUBEN:
No.

SHAWN slips the note into HORNSTOCK'S hand. The lawyer opens it as SHAWN scoots back to his chair.

HORNSTOCK:
(reads the note out loud) Cloudy McMillan?

RUBEN:
No.

HORNSTOCK:
Wendy Morning Dew? (looks at SHAWN who shrugs)

RUBEN:
That's a woman's name. Okay, look, I have a degree in meteorology from the University of Virginia.

HORNSTOCK starts towards SHAWN who imitates reeling in a big fish. RUBEN keeps talking.

RUBEN:
I wrote my thesis on Bernoulli's theorem of incompressible level flow, and I was a junior tornado safety captain for seven years. Jackson Hale has a degree in what? Physical education from a junior college. He was an embarrassment. He was worthless, all right? He was worthless to anyone who is a real meteorologist, like myself. He should've been stabbed in the heart long ago!

SHAWN signals a touchdown as the courtroom viewers murmur amongst themselves.

PHELPS:
(stands) Objection, your Honor!

JUDGE:
(bangs gavel) It's a little late for that, don't you think, counselor?

HORNSTOCK walks over to a standing SHAWN and grabs his fist and shakes it.

SHAWN:
That's the kind of confidence I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. We are on our way to winning this thing.

EXT. COURTHOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk down the front steps.

SHAWN:
Told you. She's kind and she's innocent.

GUS:
Just because we had a small victory in court yesterday doesn't mean we're out of the woods.

At the base of the stairs, JULIET and LASSITER are walking towards them. LASSITER steps in a large puddle of water.

LASSITER:
Son of a bitch.

JULIET:
Alligator pumps!

LASSITER:
I swear I should arrest that weatherman. He clearly stated it was not going to rain today.

SHAWN:
You see, that's the problem with what I like to call "group thinking." We don't listen to group thinkers.

GUS:
Nope.

SHAWN:
In fact... we don't listen to weathermen at all.

LASSITER:
If you'll excuse me, I've really got better things to do. (starts past SHAWN)

SHAWN:
Dinner with your cat?

LASSITER stops on the steps behind SHAWN and clamps a hand on his shoulder. SHAWN turns his head to look at it.

LASSITER:
O'Hara, you coming?

JULIET:
You go. I'll catch up with you a sec.

LASSITER leaves and JULIET steps closer to SHAWN.

JULIET:
You know, Shawn, for a psychic, you are missing something right in front of your face. It's too bad. You might actually learn something about Lassiter. Maybe you don't want to.

SHAWN:
He waxes his back?

JULIET:
I'm going to go now. Shawn, I don't care what anyone else says. The pink shirt is working.

JULIET starts up the stairs but stops when papers fall from her folder onto the wet ground. SHAWN sees a memo but it is backwards and only some of the letters seep through the wet paper. JULIET picks up the papers and continues up the stairs.

GUS:
Okay, that was cryptic.

SHAWN:
Not really. I'll be damned. (looks back at JULIET)

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is deciphering what he saw onto paper. GUS comes up behind him.

GUS:
Who's "Detective Assi"?

SHAWN:
Lassie. It's Lassiter. He must've sent some sort of memo to Phelps. The question is why would Lassiter send a letter to the D.A.'s office?

GUS:
Don't you ever watch "Law and Order"? They tend to work together sometimes.

SHAWN:
Right. So... so go ahead and check the files, and find me that letter. Phelps received it on the 7th.

GUS:
I've been through all of them. There are no memos, submitted into evidence, filed on the 7th.

SHAWN:
So it didn't get filed. But there is a memo. So whatever's on that memo is clearly worth hiding.

INT. COURTHOUSE, COURTROOM B EAST HALL, DAY

PHELPS is questioning LASSITER.

PHELPS:
And she told you this directly?

LASSITER:
Yes. When I questioned the defendant, she admitted to having sexual relations with the victim.

PHELPS:
But not to stabbing him with a letter opener?

SHAWN sees PHELPS' assistant reach into a case and pull out a video tape.

LASSITER:
Well, she appeared at the time to be confused, and had memory gaps. But she claimed never to have seen or touched the weapon.

PHELPS:
Even though her fingerprints were all over it. I see. Thank you, Detective Lassiter. Nothing further. (to HORNSTOCK) Your witness.

HORNSTOCK:
You sure about this?

SHAWN:
Yes, I have a very strong feeling about this letter.

HORNSTOCK:
First rule of trial law: "never ask a question you don't know the answer to".

SHAWN:
Have I steered you wrong yet? Come on. (pats HORNSTOCK on the back as he stands)

HORNSTOCK:
Um, Detective Lassiter, did you send a letter to the D.A.'s office on the 7th of August?

LASSITER:
(looks at SHAWN) Yes, I did.

HORNSTOCK:
And what did it say?

PHELPS:
I... Objection, lack of foundation.

JUDGE:
I'll allow it. Go ahead. Tell the jury what it said.

LASSITER:
It questioned the defendant's motive.

HORNSTOCK:
That it was very strong, you mean?

LASSITER:
No, it questioned whether I believed the defendant had one at all.

HORNSTOCK:
(scoffs) The prosecution never submitted this letter into evidence. So at this point, your Honor, the defense calls for a mistrial.

The crowd murmurs as the JUDGE bangs his gavel. JULIET looks at SHAWN and gives a small smile.

GUS:
Man, this is fun!

JUDGE:
Approach the bench.

SHAWN and GUS join HORNSTOCK and PHELPS at the bench.

PHELPS:
We may have received the letter. I... I can't be sure. We didn't knowingly withhold it. My office is wall-to-wall papers.

JUDGE:
Then go to Staples and buy yourself some new file folders. But until then, you are warned. (points at them with a stalk of asparagus) Any new evidence must be submitted to all parties immediately. Do I make myself clear?

PHELPS:
Yes, your Honor. And in the spirit of that ruling, I would like to submit a new piece of evidence.

JUDGE:
If this is that willy-nilly piece of evidence that you tried to get in in pre-trial, I'll tell you one more time, I will not admit any audiovisual evidence unless it's been authenticated.

PHELPS' assistant hands him a folder. SHAWN remembers the exchange from earlier about authentication.

SHAWN:
It's a videotape.

HORNSTOCK:
Hmm?

PHELPS:
We just got our authentication papers from the lab in Sacramento. It is a videotape of the defendant, Sandra Panitch, murdering the victim, Jackson Hale.

The crowd murmurs and SHAWN puts a hand on HORNSTOCK'S shoulder, rubbing it.

INT. COURTHOUSE, JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, DAY

The lawyers and consultants are standing in front of the JUDGE'S desk.

SHAWN:
Judge, I argue that this tape should not be admissible.

JUDGE:
On what grounds?

SHAWN:
Well, we're citing... unfair surprisery.

PHELPS:
I still don't understand why he is in this room. He is nothing but a disruption.

JUDGE:
Maybe someday, Phelps, when you're a judge, which I highly doubt will happen, then you can decide who's welcome in your chambers.

HORNSTOCK:
Your Honor, these guys are a part of my team, and I want them here.

PHELPS:
Why? You used to be a good lawyer, Hornstock. But let's face it, if you've got to resort to hiring this idiot psychic and his little sidekick...

GUS:
(lunges at PHELPS) I'm nobody's sidekick, you pompous ass.

SHAWN:
(puts a hand on GUS' chest) Whoa! Gus, Gus. Come on. Look at you. Gus, we are all grown men here. Let's just take a beat. Let's... let's take a step back. Let's take a step back.

GUS, SHAWN and HORNSTOCK step back.

JUDGE:
(growls) Mr. Hornstock, having now seen the video in question, I don't think I need to tell you how damaging it is. I strongly suggest at this point that you consider accepting a plea bargain for murder two.

HORNSTOCK:
Your Honor, I will have to review the tape and confer with my client.

PHELPS:
I'll tell you what, Hornstock. I will leave murder two on the table until tomorrow morning. Consider that my gift to you.

INT. HORNSTOCK, HORNSTOCK, BEIDERMAN & HORNSTOCK, OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and HORNSTOCK are sitting watching the video tape. SHAWN is eating popcorn. On the tape, HALE and SANDRA are kissing passionately. Behind them is a sunset on the green screen. HALE looks briefly at the camera.

GUS:
She doesn't realize she's being taped.

SHAWN:
Nope. I don't think this is his first barbecue either, if you know what I mean.

GUS:
This High-Def Plasma really makes a difference. I can see the beads of sweat on his neck. Look at his hair!

SHAWN:
That's horrible!

The couple on-screen fall out of camera range but their moans continue.

GUS:
Do any of you make noises like that?

SHAWN:
His or hers?

HALE screams. HORNSTOCK sits up in his chair and clears his throat.

HORNSTOCK:
When she sees this, she will certainly take the deal.

INT. COURTHOUSE, INTERVIEW ROOM, DAY

SANDRA is sitting at the table next to HORNSTOCK. GUS is standing on the opposite side and SHAWN is leaning against the wall.

SANDRA:
I'm not going to take the deal.

GUS:
If you don't take the deal, you could go away, possibly for life. You do realize this?

SANDRA:
I don't care. I'm not going to admit to something that I didn't do.

HORNSTOCK:
Okay, I believe you. I believe you. But I watched that tape. And as your attorney, I am begging you, take the deal.

SHAWN:
Don't take the deal.

HORNSTOCK:
What are you doing? You're supposed to be on my side.

SHAWN:
(leans forward on the table) Hornstock, I am on your side. I mean, not technically, because of the shape of this table. Imagine a round table. I would've sat somewhere in the middle.

HORNSTOCK:
Okay, tomorrow morning, when the jury watches this tape, we will lose this case.

SHAWN:
(picks up tape) This tape is not telling us the whole truth. There's more. (rubs tape against side of his face) I need to take this tape. You just work on your closing arguments. You leave the rest to me.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, NIGHT

SHAWN is pacing back and forth as HENRY dries dishes.

HENRY:
Quit pacing, Shawn. You're making me nervous.

SHAWN:
I can't afford it, Dad. I can't afford a guilty verdict on my record right now. I can't.

HENRY:
You do realize that you're not a real lawyer, right? You don't have a record.

SHAWN:
It's so weird. The prosecution keeps treating this case like a crime of passion, right? But she only knew him for a couple of hours. I ask you, how much passion can you muster up for someone in a couple of hours?

HENRY:
Yeah, well, crimes of passion are rarely about love or sex, Shawn. They're closer to revenge, sometimes hatred. I would say that your angry meteorologist is the best suspect you've got going.

SHAWN:
He didn't do it.

HENRY:
Yeah, I know that, Shawn but the point is you need to find somebody who felt like that.

SHAWN:
Oh, Dad, believe me, there are plenty. The guy slept with half of Santa Barbara. We can put them all on the stand. The problem is that Sandra is the only one that was there.

SHAWN looks in a canister on the kitchen island filled with utensils and pulls one out.

SHAWN:
You have a whisk.

HENRY:
I do, and you're not looking close enough. Pats SHAWN on the chest as he walks by)

SHAWN:
(follows HENRY to the table) Well, you know what? It's tough when virtually everything imaginable is stacked against me. I've got your ass staring me down in the courtroom, I've got a defense attorney who breaks every time the wind blows, I've got to hitch rides every time I need to go somewhere, because, get this, there's some rogue meter maid who's decided to have a ticketing vendetta against me and my motorcycle.

HENRY:
Well, Shawn, maybe that might not happen if you didn't park your bike 14 feet from a fire hydrant outside your apartment.

SHAWN:
Dad, you've seen my street. The parking is a joke... How did you know that?

HENRY shrugs and walks back to the counter. SHAWN follows.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. How do you know that? Wait a second. How... How did you know that?

HENRY:
(starts drying dishes again) Oh, look who's paying attention now?

SHAWN:
You tipped them off? You tipped them off about my bike?

HENRY:
Who taught you how to drive, Shawn? Who do you represent every time you're out on that road?

SHAWN:
(frustrated) I don't represent anybody when I go out on the road! Dad, they took my bike!

HENRY:
Tell it to the embassy.

SHAWN:
(stammers) And I might not be able to get it out of the impound.

HENRY:
Yeah, well, then maybe it's time for you to consider a real mode of transportation, huh?

SHAWN:
You will do anything you can to impose your will on me. You hated that bike. You have always hated that bike. And you've been especially hard-ass about it since I...

HENRY:
Since you what, Shawn? Since you what? Since you had your accident? Is that it? Is that where your old man crossed the line? Fine. I'll tell you what. I will back off, I'm gonna lay off, man. I'll tell you what you do. You take me off your call list the next time the ambulance picks you up and brings you in that door. All right? Fair. Get over yourself, kid. Or at least learn how to park. (goes outside with coffee)

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is asleep in an easy chair, Chinese takeaway on his lap, chopsticks in his mouth like walrus tusks. On the TV is the video of the murder. He is startled awake by the sound of the door closing. GUS enters.

GUS:
Shawn, what are you doing? Do you know what time it is?

SHAWN:
What? What time...What time is it?

GUS:
It's 9:00. We're late for court. I called you a million times.

SHAWN peers at the cloud formation on the screen.

SHAWN:
Gus...

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Would you say anger is a good motivator?

GUS:
Did you see your dad again?

SHAWN:
Yes, I did. And I think it actually worked.

INT. COURTHOUSE, COURTROOM B EAST HALL, DAY

HORNSTOCK is sitting forlornly at the table. SANDRA is sitting at the other end, hands on her lap.

JUDGE:
Mr. Hornstock?

SHAWN and GUS enter the courtroom.

HORNSTOCK:
Your Honor, the defense has nothing more.

SHAWN:
Uh, not so fast.

SHAWN stands by HORNSTOCK as GUS sits by SANDRA.

JUDGE:
Excuse me?

SHAWN:
(whispers to HORNSTOCK) Call Priscilla Osterman to the stand.

HORNSTOCK:
(whispers) What are you talking about? She already testified.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Can we recall her?

HORNSTOCK:
(whispers)Yes, if we have new information, but I have nothing else to ask her.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Oh, trust me. I am feeling all kinds of good stuff here.

HORNSTOCK:
(stands) Your Honor, the defense calls Ms. Osterman back to the stand.

PHELPS:
Objection.

JUDGE:
Overruled. I'm giving you the teeniest latitude, providing you have some new evidence to mine here.

PRISCILLA walks forward and takes her place in the stand.

JUDGE:
Ms. Osterman, I remind you that you are still under oath. Proceed, counselor.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Ask her if she is absolutely certain that she did not sleep with Jackson Hale.

HORNSTOCK:
Ms. Osterman, are you absolutely certain you did not sleep with Jackson Hale?

PHELPS:
Objection, Your Honor. Asked and answered in prior testimony.

JUDGE:
Sustained. I'm not kidding, counselor. I'm giving you one more question, And then I'm shutting you down.

HORNSTOCK holds up and finger and walks back to the table.

SHAWN:
Did you want to?

PHELPS:
(stands and points at SHAWN) Objection! This man is not a lawyer. He has no right to address the witness.

GUS:
(stands) Actually, Your Honor, he can, under rule 775a of the California State rules of evidence. (refers to law book) The rule gives the court wide discretion over the mode and order of presenting evidence, effective for the ascertainment of the truth. Precedence, Killmer vs Duchscher. I mean, we are trying to ascertain the truth here, aren't we?

JUDGE:
That is absolutely correct, young man. Where did you attend law school?

GUS:
Just sixth grade law, Your Honor. But it was an accelerated program. (sits)

SHAWN walks his fingers across the table before holding out his fist. GUS bumps it.

JUDGE:
It is up to my discretion to allow any testimony that may speak to the truth of this case. Proceed, Mr. Spencer, with caution.

SHAWN:
Thank you, Your Honor. (softly) All right. Just warming her up for you, bro.

HORNSTOCK:
Yeah. Go.

SHAWN walks in front of the stand.

SHAWN:
Hi, Priscilla.

PRISCILLA:
Hi.

SHAWN:
Everybody here is absolutely certain you didn't sleep with Jackson Hale. But Jackson Hale slept with everybody. Except for you. Isn't that right? You couldn't take it, could you? Him walking by every single day and never noticing you. Not once! Repeatedly choosing to sleep with women like the defendant, Sandra Panitch!

PRISCILLA:
Well, that's... That's not...That's not true.

SHAWN:
That video will show Jackson Hale being murdered, but not by Sandra Panitch. By you.

PHELPS:
(stands) Objection, Your Honor. I mean... This is...it's ridiculous.

SHAWN:
(puts fingers to temples) I feel the tape is the proof! The tape is the pudding!

PHELPS:
Your Honor, I said objection! I demand you get him to stop that!

JUDGE:
Sit down. Do you need a tutorial in rule 775?

SHAWN:
(points to baliff) Mr. Riggs, can you please play the tape again?

RIGGS starts the tape again.

SHAWN:
Thank you. Uh, uh, just take it back a little bit? And forward. I'm sorry. It was forward. And back. Just forward. Right there. (sees silhouette of distinctive glasses)  Right there. Right here. (puts his hand on the screen and pulls it off with his other) That. That right there. It's a cloud. Not a cloud, a shadow. A shadow of a human person. (walks back to PRISCILLA) You were wearing those glasses that night, making it unmistakable that you were there. That is your shadow, Priscilla. You watched. You waited. Waited for them to drop out of frame, then bam, on the head to Sandra, and...(makes sound effects with twisting motion) Into the heart of Jackson. You didn't think there was any way you could be blamed. Because clouds don't kill people. People kill people. (slams hand down on the edge of the stand) But this was a crime of passion.

HORNSTOCK:
But not because he loved you. (trades places with SHAWN) But because he didn't.

PRISCILLA:
He walked by me in the hallway every day like I didn't exist. Like I was invisible.

HORNSTOCK:
And so you proved him right by being invisible on that tape.

PRISCILLA:
We would have been the most amazing couple. He just refused to see it. He just broke my heart over and over and over again, so I just broke his!

HORNSTOCK:
By stabbing it with a letter opener!

PRISCILLA:
Yes, yes! I killed him!(realizes what she said) No. Oh!

SHAWN:
Holy crap. Did you just hear that?

JUDGE:
We heard that, yes.

SHAWN:
Sorry, Your Honor. Usually when I do this, when things come to me psychically, I got to jump through all these hoops, you know? I gotta find Interim Chief Vick, I gotta run stuff by Lassie there. Sign a bunch of papers, t's, i's, the whole bit. Seems like we got everything we need here. You, the jury, the stenographer, Mr. Riggs! (salutes)

HORNSTOCK:
I move to release the defendant immediately and take the witness into custody for processing.

JUDGE:
Bailiff! (bangs gavel) Case dismissed.

INT. SBPD, LOBBY, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the building.

SHAWN:
You mean to tell me our whole lives you've never been to a single auction?

GUS:
Nope.

SHAWN:
Dude, watch this. It's very fun.

GUS:
How is it fun? You're bidding against the public for your own motorcycle. What happens if somebody outbids you?

SHAWN:
I've been practicing my paddle raise. It's very subtle. (looks around) Where is this thing? You know, plus, now that Carter Jarecki's wife has hired us to consult on her divorce, we're flush. I can go as high as I need to go.

GUS:
Okay.

SHAWN:
(sees HENRY talking with a man) Dad?

HENRY:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
What are you doing here?

HENRY:
I came for the auction. (walks past him and down the stairs)

SHAWN:
(follows) Was there a boating incident I didn't hear about? A little tuna boat get impounded?

INT. SBPD, LOWER LEVEL, DAY

HENRY:
You know, actually, Shawn, no. I felt bad about those tickets, so I'm here to get your bike for you.

SHAWN:
Get out of here.

HORNSTOCK arrives at the top of the stairs.

HORNSTOCK:
Hey, Shawn, Gus! What's up? (goes down stairs)

SHAWN:
Hey!

GUS:
Hey!

HORNSTOCK:
Legal eagles! I thought I might see you here. Oh, you know, the name partners were very impressed, and they're anxious to hire you guys again. Especially this new guy. What's his name? Oh, it's me.

GUS:
Hey! Congratulations.

SHAWN holds out his fist and HORNSTOCK bumps it.

SHAWN:
You got the bump!

HORNSTOCK:
Thank you. (fist bumps GUS)

SHAWN:
We'd love to work with you.

GUS:
So, what is it now? Hornstock, Hornstock, Hornstock, Biederman, and Hornstock?

HORNSTOCK:
We had to get wider doors, but yes. Hey, I didn't get to thank you properly. So, you know, I'm here for the auction. I'm going to put some money down on that bike, get it back for you.

HENRY chuckles.

SHAWN:
Hey, guys, really, I do. I appreciate it, it's very sweet but I can stand on my own two feet and get my own bike back.

A motorcycle is wheeled down a hall and a sturdy shoe kicks down the stand.

BUZZ:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Buzz.

BUZZ:
I believe this is yours. They just pulled it from the auction. (walks into the room with them)

GUS:
Pulled from the auction?

SHAWN:
I was... I was... I've been practicing my paddle raise. It's a subtle move.

BUZZ:
Yeah, you got your bike back. It was taken care of internally.

SHAWN:
What does that mean, "internally"?

BUZZ:
I don't know. They just gave me the paperwork. (gives SHAWN paperwork and goes upstairs)

LASSITER comes through the same doorway as BUZZ, hand rubbing the back of his head. He stops when he sees SHAWN and the others standing there. They look up at him.

LASSITER:
What are you looking at? (heads upstairs) Go home!

SHAWN looks after him, baffled.

Episode 1x13 Game, Set, Muurder

1985

EXT. SPENCER HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are sitting at the picnic table playing "Battleship". All we see is their eyes peering over the top of the game.

GUS:
B4.

SHAWN:
Miss. A7.

GUS:
Hit. D9.

SHAWN:
Miss. B6.

GUS:
Hit. (puts in a peg as SHAWN sinks another ship) Shawn!

SHAWN:
What?

HENRY is taking out the garbage when he hears the boys grunting. He drops the bucket and runs back.

HENRY:
Hey! (finds them fighting on the ground) Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Knock it off. Knock it off. What the heck is going on here?

They stop and look up at HENRY.

GUS:
Mr. Spencer, Shawn's been cheating.

SHAWN:
Have not!

GUS:
Are too! You hit my ships every time.

HENRY:
Both of you, on your feet, now. (the boys stand up) Best friends do not accuse each other of cheating. Best friends do not resort to fighting every time they have an argument. You both know that I have a partner on the force, right?

BOTH:
Yes, sir.

HENRY:
Well, we couldn't do our job if we didn't trust each other completely. There are rules to a partnership, and they are the same rules for a friendship, even Battleship, but those rules don't work without what?

BOTH:
Trust, sir.

HENRY:
That's right. (looks at SHAWN'S board) Shawn! Over here, now. Why aren't there any of your ships on the board?

GUS:
I knew it!

HENRY:
Cheating. You're grounded.

SHAWN:
But, Dad!

HENRY:
(walks SHAWN over to the table) And for the next two months, you are going to play with one less piece.

SHAWN:
But that's not fair!

HENRY:
Exactly, Shawn. Now you know what it feels like.

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and JULIET are walking through the hall by the main entrance.

JULIET:
Shawn, I can't just give you a case because Gus is out of town this weekend and you're lonely.

SHAWN:
Fine. Maybe together we can figure out how I can be less lonely. (puts hand to his head) Wait, I'm getting something. Baby oil.

JULIET walks away. Down the hall, SHAWN sees an older man in a track suit talking with VICK. He hands her a photo.

MAN:
This is a photo from about a year ago.

SHAWN sees the photo of a young girl with a ponytail and sweatband around her head. She is holding a trophy.

MAN:
And this is from last week.

The MAN shows VICK an article with a photo of the same girl playing tennis.

VICK:
Thank you. We'll call you if we turn anything up on her, Mr. Sirtis. (shakes his hand)

SIRTIS:
I appreciate your help, Chief.

VICK:
Our pleasure.

SIRTIS leaves and LASSITER walks over to VICK as she enters her office.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

LASSITER:
I'm telling you, I can make the time, Chief.

VICK:
Your plate is full, detective.

LASSITER:
I already pulled the old file.

JULIET follows LASSITER into the office.

VICK:
If any of your other cases suffer, then I will yank you right off of this case...

SHAWN, wearing a woman's scarf as a blindfold, walks into the door of VICK'S office before making it into the office proper.

LASSITER:
Spencer, what the hell are you doing?

SHAWN:
I'm trying something. I feel conventional vision is weakening my skills.

JULIET:
Is that my scarf?

SHAWN:
I... I'm getting "service." "Return service." No. A net. A fish net? No. I l-O-Ve somebody. (puts his hand on LASSITER'S head) Now I'm getting Grecian Formula. That's weird. (LASSITER removes SHAWN'S hand with for force than required) It's not about what's there. It's about what's missing. Tennis equipment. No. (grunts like a female player) A tennis player is missing. (removes scarf) Bjorn Borg is missing! No. Who's missing?

VICK:
Congratulations, Mr. Spencer. You've just joined the case.

LASSITER:
What?

VICK:
We can all pitch in. (hands SHAWN the photo) Deanna Sirtis was supposed to meet her father, Leonard, at the airport last night.

JULIET:
They were flying to Tokyo for a tournament, but she never showed up. The last time anyone saw her was at tennis practice that morning.

SHAWN looks over the photo to the file on VICK'S desk and sees a headline about a stalker.

SHAWN:
Has anyone checked out her stalker?

JULIET:
Felix Alvarez? We're looking into him, since we know he broke into her house a few months ago.

VICK:
What we need from you now is to psychically locate Deanna while we follow leads using conventional methods.

SHAWN:
You mean Lassie and I can work together?

LASSITER:
Yeah, but separate.

SHAWN:
Should we synchronize our watches?

LASSITER:
You're not wearing a watch.

SHAWN:
That's a good point. Chief, I'd like to put in a requisition order for a new watch. Lassie, can you sign for that?

VICK:
All right, that's enough. Just...Now, let's go do your jobs. All of you.

LASSITER takes the file from the desk and they all head for the door. SHAWN and LASSITER try to fit through the door at the same time. LASSITER glares at SHAWN who then holds his arm out to let the detective goes first. Before LASSITER could make it through, SHAWN went first. LASSITER turns to VICK.

LASSITER:
Thank you.

EXT. PARK, DAY

GUS stands on top of a monolith. Below him, a large group of people are standing, holding a large sheet. They are chanting GUS' name. He takes a deep breath and falls backwards, landing in the center of the sheet. They lower him gently to the ground and applaud as he stands. His cell phone rings and he steps away to answer it.

GUS:
Hello?

SHAWN:
Dude, how long till you come back?

GUS:
We just got here.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is on the phone with GUS, feet up on the desk. He has the squeaky frog toy in his hand.

SHAWN:
But you can come home during the weekend, right?

GUS:
This is a weekend, Shawn. It's a retreat with trust exercises to build up a sense of teamwork around the camp.

SHAWN:
Camp? You didn't say you were camping. Are you making s'mores? Can I have some? Have you done "who's got my golden arm" yet? Let me come do it.

GUS:
Shawn, what do you need?

SHAWN:
Have you ever heard of Deanna Sirtis?

GUS:
She's a tennis player. Local. Ranked in the low 100s.

SHAWN:
She's a missing tennis player, ranked 147, and she's our new case.

GUS:
I can't, Shawn. Reingold just retired.

SHAWN:
Ah, yes, Reingold. What the hell does that mean?

GUS:
It means they're reassigning his clients, Shawn. He has this one doctor with a huge practice. Dr. Magnotti. He prescribes in bulk, Shawn. I'm talking Costco bulk. I could make my monthly quota in like a day, but to get to him, I got to schmooze my supervisor, so you're on your own this time.

A WOMAN comes running up to GUS holding a stick.

WOMAN:
Gus! Guess what, Gus...

GUS:
(to SHAWN) Hold on.

GUS places the phone against his chest but SHAWN still hears.

WOMAN:
We just elected you to be the first one to hold the sharing stick... (hands him the stick)

GUS:
What?

WOMAN:
...in the sensitivity circle tonight.

GUS:
All right, this is great!

WOMAN:
Okay. (leaves)

GUS:
All right. Oh, gosh.

SHAWN:
That's funny. It sounded like someone just said "sharing stick." Dude, get out of there.

GUS:
I have no choice. I hate the stupid sharing stick. But I couldn't get out of this even if I wanted to.

SHAWN:
I've taken care of that already.

TOM, the man leading the retreat comes over to GUS. His face is green.

TOM:
Burton! Why haven't you painted yourself green?

GUS:
Excuse me?

TOM:
We're all painting ourselves green. It's an envy-retention thing. Oh, it doesn't matter now. I just heard about your grandmother.

GUS:
My grandmother? (looks at his phone realizing this is SHAWN'S doing)

TOM:
Slipped in the tub. Broken hip. Go square her away and get back here as soon as you can.

GUS hands TOM the sharing stick and runs off.

INT. DEANNA'S BEDROOM, DAY

The walls are covered with photographs of DEANNA. One shows her with a manicure with a palm tree on her nail.

SHAWN:
Well, at least we won't forget what she looks like.

SIRTIS:
My daughter definitely liked having her photo taken. I think it's what she liked most about winning. Photography was her hobby, too. But we don't have a lot of time for hobbies.

GUS notices a security camera above the door.

GUS:
You keep a security camera in her room?

SIRTIS:
That guy, Felix Alvarez, the one the cops are looking for now, after he broke in, we beefed up security.

GUS:
I remember reading about that break-in here. It must have been traumatic for her.

SIRTIS:
Yeah. It felt like she never got back to her former self as a player.

SHAWN:
Mr. Sirtis, the spirits can be, bashful.

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Sometimes grumpy, sleepy, dopey...

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
Sneezy...

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
What I'm saying is (inhales) they won't talk to me unless no one is in the room except myself and my compatriot.

GUS:
That's me.

SHAWN:
That includes security cameras.

SIRTIS:
I'll get it turned off.

SHAWN:
Thank you, sir.

GUS:
Thank you.

SIRTIS leaves the room and SHAWN and GUS begin to look around the room.

GUS:
Cameras in her room? Can you say "control freak"?

SHAWN:
Can you say "typical sports dad"?

SHAWN finds a jewelry box on a shelf and opens it.

SHAWN:
Whoa!

GUS:
(turns and looks at him) What?

SHAWN:
These diamonds pretty much nail the four Cs. I bet they're from daddy.

GUS:
Yeah.

GUS turns back to examining the bureau and SHAWN sees a small ring off to the side that is of lesser quality than the other pieces.

SHAWN:
Except for this one. (takes it out) Look. This is way too cheap. You see how the gold chips off when you slide it around? This is from somebody else. Somebody who's not loaded. (hands the ring to GUS)

GUS:
This is an eternity ring. You're supposed to wear this all the time, and it's usually given to you by someone, you know, intimate. (slips it on his pinkie)

SHAWN:
Why do you know that?

GUS:
I gave one to Jessica Chan.

SHAWN:
Ah, yes. Jessica Chan. And how long was eternity for the two of you?

GUS:
Three months, but they were awesome months. Except for the end part. (tries to pull the ring off)

SHAWN:
Right, I'd never seen a girl lie about entering the Witness Protection Program.

GUS:
She wasn't lying, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Gus, I saw her at Starbucks.

GUS:
You can't be sure of that.

SHAWN:
She was wearing a name tag. She had a plaque on the wall. Employee of the month. Her hobbies were hiding and... lying about hiding.

GUS:
(finally gets ring off) Fine. Whatever. Drop it. My point is, why isn't Deanna wearing hers all the time?

SHAWN:
She clearly has someone daddy doesn't approve of. We find the mystery lover, we find her. (walks off dramatically)

GUS:
Dude, why don't I ever get to say stuff like that? (follows after SHAWN)

EXT. COFFEE SHOP, BEACH, DAY

LASSITER is walking out of the shop on his cell, coffee in his other hand.

LASSITER:
All right, get her down to the station, take her statement. Nail down the last time she saw Deanna. I'm on my way in now. (ends call)

SHAWN and GUS walk up behind him.

SHAWN:
I'm sensing you're drinking a... non-fat vanilla half-caf with lots of whipped cream but without your usual pink straw.

LASSITER:
(stops and turns) What, are you two stalking me now? Or did you come to tell me where the missing girl is?

SHAWN:
No.

LASSITER turns back and continues walking away.

SHAWN:
But, I did divine that Deanna has a secret boyfriend, which sounds like a lead to me.

LASSITER:
(stops and turns) Yeah, we're looking into all her relationships. But you see, it's my job to investigate people with things like, you know, motive, means, and opportunity. Stop following me. (continues on and SHAWN and GUS follow with exaggerated steps) What did I say?

(turns)

SHAWN:
Look, man, I've been meaning to have the same conversation with you about leading me. To be honest, I'm sick of it. We either walk side by side or not at all.

A horn honks and HENRY pulls up in his truck. LASSITER, SHAWN and GUS walk over. HENRY gets out and talks to them over the bed of the pick-up.

HENRY:
Shawn, six months ago, I called you up, as or not you wanted any of this junk.

SHAWN:
How come you only call me to come pick up stuff?

HENRY:
You didn't listen. Now I'm donating all of it to Goodwill. I'm on my way there right now, so you've got about 30 seconds. Last looks.

SHAWN starts going through the items in the truck.

SHAWN:
Whoa! (pulls out a T-shirt) No, no, no. You cannot throw out my Whitesnake t-shirt. You can't get this in stores anymore.

GUS:
(sees an item in the truck) That is... (takes it out) This is my Airwolf windbreaker. I've been looking for this for like five years now. Why did you take this? I never even saw you wear it.

SHAWN:
Of course I didn't wear it. I took it so you wouldn't. Don't put it on. (GUS puts on the jacket)  Gus, nobody had an Airwolf jacket except Jan-Michael Vincent.

LASSITER:
Whoa. (reaches into the truck) This looks like a custom Sak-Hart graphite rod and reel.

HENRY:
That's right. Good eye.

LASSITER:
You can't throw something like this away.

HENRY:
It's 15 years old.

LASSITER:
15? It looks brand new.

HENRY:
Well, that's because it's never been used. Bought it for him.

LASSITER:
Man, I have been itching to get out on the blue and hook some snapper, but you know what a chore it is to get the boat, and...

HENRY:
You're welcome to come with me tomorrow morning. Boat leaves at 5:00 a.m. sharp. Princess here, never could get him up.

SHAWN:
Look, the American Medical Association clearly states that the proper amount of sleep...

LASSITER:
Well, if you're sure you don't mind a little company?

HENRY:
If you're sure you can be there at 5:00 a.m.

LASSITER:
I'll be on the docks at 4:15. (picks up coffee) Spencer. (leaves)

HENRY slaps the side of the truck before getting in and driving away.

SHAWN:
What just happened here?

GUS:
(takes off jacket) I think your dad just made his first play-date.

SHAWN:
It's not funny.

GUS:
It is.

SHAWN:
He gave away my custom something-something pole. I loved that thing.

GUS:
You gonna to get it back?

SHAWN:
No, we are going to the Vista Rica health and racquet club.

GUS:
Now is not the time for a steam, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Gus, Deanna was seen practicing there the morning she disappeared. If she's some sort of tennis star, she probably goes there a lot.

GUS:
(puts a hand on SHAWN'S arm) Maybe someone saw her with her mystery lover! How did that sound?

SHAWN:
It feels like you're pushing. You're pressing.

EXT. VISTA RICA CLUB, TENNIS COURT, DAY

SHAWN and GUS step onto the court where a teenage GIRL is practicing serves.

GUS:
Deanna's coach is in Tokyo, but the manager said this girl was here practicing the last time Deanna was.

SHAWN:
Sweet.

GUS:
Excuse me. Can we talk to you for a second?

GIRL:
I only have 11 minutes left to practice.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but isn't it better if someone's over there to return your serve?

GIRL:
You play?

SHAWN:
No, but this is Vernest Lambert Watkins. He was a junior champion of some junior league. What did you guys call yourselves? The Little Green Fuzzy Men?

GUS:
The Yellow Hornets. But that was like 10 years ago.

SHAWN:
He'll give you a workout. We're just going to have a chat.

GUS:
Racquets over here? (heads to the other side of the court)

SHAWN:
(pushes cart of tennis balls out of the way) Now, I can sense you were here the day Deanna disappeared.

GIRL:
Duh! Everybody knows we hit together. What are you, a genius?

GUS does some warm-up leaps on the other end of the court, racket in hand. He then takes up the receiving position.

SHAWN:
Actually, I'm a psychic, and I don't think I like your tone.

SHAWN tosses her a tennis ball and she serves, acing it past GUS. SHAWN backs away a little.

SHAWN:
Let me rephrase that, and don't read anything into my tone, (gives her another tennis ball) why do you think she didn't show up to that tournament in Tokyo?

The GIRL serves again and GUS hits it back, long.

GIRL:
Out!

GUS:
Out? Out, my ass! You can't be serious! That ball was clearly on the line!

SHAWN:
Long. Long by a hair, buddy.

GUS grunts in frustration and goes back to position.

SHAWN:
Any ideas?

GIRL:
You know what her weakness was?

SHAWN:
Kittens?

GIRL:
Focus. All she thought about was boys.

The GIRL serves again, GUS returns it and she sends it back, hitting GUS. He looks at her in anger.

SHAWN:
Cowboy up there, buddy!

GUS:
Shut up.

SHAWN:
Any boys in particular?

GIRL:
She was not particular at all, but I heard she started hanging out with that Doug Lenmar.

GUS:
Doug Lenmar? He's one of the top-ranked players on the men's tour.

GIRL:
He stinks. No net game. Her father totally freaked when he found out, and told her to end it. Then she tried to be all rebellious, and stormed off the court.

GUS serves and the GIRL plays as she continues to talk with SHAWN. She makes GUS run as she barely moves.

SHAWN:
How grody of her.

GIRL:
"Grody"?

SHAWN:
Grody to the max. Grody with a spoon. Come on work with me. I don't know what the kids are saying these days.

GIRL:
I don't remember anything else. That's all I heard.

SHAWN:
Well, you hear a lot.

GIRL:
Coaches are more gossipy than housewives. Just watch. In five years, she'll be knocked up and living in government-assisted housing.

SHAWN:
It's good to see the game hasn't hardened you.

GUS' hit goes long and hits the fence.

GIRL:
Out!

EXT. VISTA RICA CLUB, PATH, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk the path from the tennis courts.

GUS:
Okay, so we know she had a secret boyfriend, Doug Lenmar, but if he was in Tokyo, why wouldn't she go to see him?

SHAWN:
Let's find out if he really is in Tokyo. If so, plan B. She was boy-crazy. There's got to be more than one dude in the mix.

GUS:
Maybe she's not missing. Maybe she's hiding.

SHAWN:
To keep her dad off her case. But where would she hide? Ooh.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN has seen a poster ad for a nail salon displaying the design DEANNA had in one of her photos.

SHAWN:
I have the urge to suddenly get my bunions buffed.

INT. NAIL SALON, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are lying back in salon chairs, the polish from their mani-pedis drying. SHAWN is completely relaxed, eyes closed, and GUS is a bit uptight.

GUS:
Shawn, this is completely unnecessary.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Deanna was here. We have to retrace her steps.

GUS:
(whispers) And the paraffin wax dip?

SHAWN:
(whispers) You know how flaky my knuckles get. Two birds, one stone. I've never felt so productive.

GUS:
(whispers) And exactly how much information do you plan on getting from a manicurist that can't speak English?

SHAWN:
(whispers) None so far. Hold on.

SHAWN turns his head so he can watch the girl at the front desk. She is asked by another girl to come into the back office. She does and the desk is free.

SHAWN:
Dude.

They get up from the chairs and waddle over to the computer as they are wearing toe separators.

GUS:
Hurry up!

SHAWN:
(looks up DEANNA on the computer) She was here yesterday.

GUS:
(points) Check that out. (pushes in front of SHAWN)

SHAWN:
Gus, you're going to smudge my gloss.

GUS:
She ordered nail protein solution.

SHAWN:
So she has weak, peeling nails.

GUS:
No, genius. The billing address is her father's place, but the delivery address is someplace else.

SHAWN:
Nice focus, Gus.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
Maybe you're ready to take on that little girl again.

EXT. STREET, DAY

GUS and SHAWN walk purposefully down the sunny street.

SHAWN:
Gus, I feel good about this. She's going to be here, safe and sound.

They arrive at the apartment and find police and an ambulance outside.

GUS:
Or not.

SHAWN and GUS walk closer. DEANNA is wheeled out on a stretcher. There is a bloody bandage around her head, a brace on her neck and she is on oxygen. LASSITER and JULIET walk behind.

LASSITER:
All right, I want to talk to her the minute she wakes up. If she wakes up. (puts on sunglasses and leaves)

GUS:
What happened here?

JULIET:
This isn't a missing person case anymore. It's attempted murder. (walks away)

GUS:
Man, even she gets to say stuff like that.

INT. DEANNA'S APARTMENT, DAY

The forensics crew is dusting for prints and taking photographs of the apartment as GUS and SHAWN enter. SHAWN notices a necklace on the floor is cheaper than her other pieces.

SHAWN:
(whispers) That's more crappy jewelry. That means that the working class boyfriend has been here.

The PHOTOGRAPHER notices them.

PHOTOGRAPHER:
Hey, aren't you Henry Spencer's kid?

SHAWN:
That I am. (walks over)

PHOTOGRAPHER:
I took a six-week course he taught at the academy. (opens monogrammed equipment bag)

SHAWN:
Lucky you. How was he?

PHOTOGRAPHER:
Uh...

SHAWN:
Yeah, that just about sums it up. You mind if we poke around a little?

PHOTOGRAPHER:
No.

LASSITER and JULIET enter the apartment.

LASSITER:
We do. We mind quite a bit, actually. You know what? Scratch that. I'm going to let you guys stick around and see what real detectives do.

SHAWN:
Sweet! Just let us know when they arrive.

GUS chuckles. LASSITER and JULIET put on latex gloves to search the apartment.

JULIET:
Deanna shared this place with another player on the tour, so her name wasn't on the lease. But Lassiter found one of her close friends. Apparently, they met frequently at that Indian restaurant. (points to restaurant across the street) We canvassed the area with her photo, and the owner of this building recognized her, so... we opened the door, and voila.

SHAWN:
Voila.

LASSITER:
(looking at day calendar) O'Hara, come take a look at this.

JULIET joins LASSITER.

GUS:
Check this out.

GUS and SHAWN walk to a shelving unit that is lined with photographs of DEANNA.

GUS:
I think these were all taken inside this apartment.

SHAWN:
I think you're right.

SHAWN sees a trophy on a shelf in a number of photos. It's not there now.

SHAWN:
Wait a second.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN points at the photo for GUS before having a "vision".

SHAWN:
I see something! I see... a trophy... but I'm out of place. I've been... kidnapped!

JULIET:
There is a trophy missing from here, and we know she suffered a blunt force trauma.

LASSITER:
Possibly the weapon. Good work, O'Hara.

GUS:
O'Hara? That was all us!

LASSITER:
I think your tutorial in police work is done now. Goodbye.

GUS is upset. SHAWN looks around and sees two wine glasses missing from the rack and the toilet seat was left up.

SHAWN:
It's cool. I've got everything we need.

SHAWN and GUS leave.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN is sprawled in one of the chairs by the window. GUS gets off the phone and walks over.

GUS:
Deanna is listed as critical but stable for now. She's touch and go for the next 48 hours. (leans on the table between the chairs)

The TV is running an alert on Felix Alvarez using previous arrest photos.

MAN ON TV:
...and is considered to be armed and dangerous. Anyone with information as to the whereabouts of this man...

GUS:
(stands) Gosh! Finding Deanna lit a fire under the department. (turns off TV) Lassiter's been having these advisory alerts run 24/7. (leans against SHAWN'S desk)

SHAWN:
So let me get this straight. Their theory is that Felix followed her to her hide away and showed his love by trying to kill her?

GUS:
Not a terrible theory.

SHAWN:
Let's review, shall we? (jumps onto the chair in a kneeling position) No forced entry. That means she either let the attacker in or he had a key. Sounds like someone she was intimate with. Now, the toilet seat in her apartment was up, so we know there was a guy there recently. I doubt a killer stopped to use the little boys' room, so let's assume the phantom boyfriend stopped by for a matinee. (stands on the chair like he's surfing) And there were two wine glasses missing from her set, so she probably shared a drink with him, and he grabbed the glasses, which had his fingerprints on them, as he beat a discreet retreat. (jumps down to floor) None of that points to Felix.

GUS:
I got to get back to work. (grabs keys and heads for the door)

SHAWN:
Now? You're going to leave now, when we're up to our necks in intrigue?

GUS:
The case is almost closed. We have the girl. She's still alive. The cops beat us. Let them have this one.

SHAWN:
How can you be so negative?

GUS:
Easy. I need face time with my boss. I already missed the pamper pole trust exercise.

SHAWN:
I'm uncomfortable with you even saying the words "pamper pole." Look, every minute the cops spend looking for Felix, the real attacker breathes easier. Now, we have got to convince them to start looking for other suspects.

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

VICK is sitting at the head of the table closest to the door with JULIET and LASSITER on her left.

LASSITER:
No. (stands)

VICK:
Unless you can give us something more substantial, Mr. Spencer, we're going to continue the manhunt for Felix Alvarez.

SHAWN:
Manhunt?

VICK:
Mmm-hmm.

Behind SHAWN, LASSITER opens the door.

SHAWN:
Hey, I can project Tommy Lee Jones from The Fugitive, if you'd like. (as Tommy Lee Jones) I want a hard target search for every outhouse, henhouse, cathouse, Waffle House, House, M.D.! (LASSITER puts a hand on his shoulder and escorts him out of the room)

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN:
House of Long Shadows?

LASSITER:
What?

The PHOTOGRAPHER comes up behind them and hands LASSITER a large envelope.

PHOTOGRAPHER:
Crime scene photos, detective. (passes them)

LASSITER:
It's about time. Were you on a break? Whoa! (catches a hat thrown at him) Hey!

HENRY is waiting for them.

SHAWN:
Dad? Now what?

LASSITER sets the envelope on the counter and opens up the hat.

HENRY:
I just stopped by to drop off this hat for Mr. Lassiter, so he can look the part the next time we go out and catch us some snapper.

LASSITER:
Thanks.

LASSITER and HENRY shake hands.

SHAWN:
The next time you go out and... Isn't that my hat?

HENRY:
What are you doing here?

LASSITER:
Oh, you know, just interrupting an official briefing, and being a general pain in my ass.

HENRY:
Yeah, well, try living with him for 17 years.

SHAWN:
Excuse me. I have a killer to catch. (walks off)

LASSITER:
Good luck with that.

EXT. PARK, DAY

GUS is blindfolded, arms crossed in front of him, as he stands in the center of a group of co-workers. They gently push him as he leans, passing him around the circle. A whistle blows.

TOM:
And time! Nicely done.

GUS pulls off the blindfold and sees SHAWN coming up the walk.

GUS:
Excuse me one second. (goes over to SHAWN) What're you doing here?

SHAWN:
Dude, you turned off your cell phone.

GUS:
Some might take that as a hint, as in, "leave me alone."

TOM, who is back-to-back, tied at the arms and legs with the WOMAN from earlier, comes over.

TOM:
Burton? You're not having visitors, are you? You know my policy on visitors.

GUS:
He's not a visitor. He's...

SHAWN:
(changes the way he talks) Jerry Hathaway. I, too, work at Central Coast. In the lab. (shakes TOM'S hand) Yes, I worked on the mono-thio-huxtable drug. It's for pancake-reactic function.

GUS:
Pancreatic.

SHAWN:
Actually, no, Burton, it was pancake.

GUS:
Really?

SHAWN:
Yes. There are properties in the batter that helped to stabilize the ions we were working with.

WOMAN:
I've never heard of that project.

SHAWN:
It was a great drug. But it caused headaches, stomachaches, toothaches, weight gain, weight loss, balding, severe oily bowel discharge, and, in very rare cases, it made you pee fire.

TOM:
Wow!

SHAWN:
Yeah, so the higher-ups shelved the project, much to my chagrin.

TOM:
I thought I knew all the lab guys. I'm surprised we've never met before.

SHAWN:
I don't make much of an impact on other human beings. It's terrible for my self-esteem. In fact, I've...I've been here all weekend, and this is the first conversation I've had. And Tom, you should know that... nobody made me a nametag. (hangs his head as if embarrassed)

TOM:
You know what we say about that here. Hello. (waves)

SHAWN:
(waves back) Hi, Tom.

TOM:
No, I mean the motto of the weekend. H-E-L-L-O.

GUS:
(whispers to SHAWN) Lop off the last letter, and you got what this weekend really is.

TOM:
Stands for "health, esteem, life, love, openness."

SHAWN:
Oh, that's pretty keen, Tom. You know, in the spirit of openness, I've always looked up to Gus. He's everything I wish I was. Do you think maybe we could work on the next exercise together?

GUS:
No, we can't do that.

TOM:
Burton! I believe your friend is reaching out right now. I think you two would be perfect candidates for the minefield. Burton, you have to keep your eyes closed while your friend leads you through a series of obstacles.

SHAWN:
Oh, Tom, that sounds really bitchin'!

GUS:
Uh, can I talk to him alone for a second?

TOM:
Sure.

GUS:
Oh, great. Thanks. (walks a short distance with SHAWN) Oh, gosh.

SHAWN:
Dude, I've got bad news.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Deanna's doctors say she's showing signs of improvement.

GUS:
Shawn, in the health care community, we call that good news.

SHAWN:
Given what we already know? Does she know her attacker?

GUS:
Yes.

SHAWN:
Does that mean when she wakes up she can ID him?

GUS:
She IDs him and the case is closed. Where's the downside?

SHAWN:
Because if you're the bad guy and you know your victim can wake up and point the finger at you...

GUS:
(dramatically) He'll find her and finish her off.

SHAWN:
You're just not landing it. The point is Deanna's life is in danger now more than ever, and she needs us.

TOM and the WOMAN walk over.

TOM:
Burton, is there a problem?

SHAWN:
Yes, Tom, I'm afraid there is. Burton's grandmother just called. She's broken her hip.

TOM:
I thought you dealt with that issue already.

GUS:
The other side. Tore the MCL. She did it while trying to do her line dancing classes.

TOM:
Why was an 87 years old woman with a broken hip attending a line dancing class?

GUS:
Attending? (scoffs) She was teaching it.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET are bringing in a handcuffed ALVAREZ. His GRANDMOTHER is walking behind LASSITER.

GRANDMOTHER:
You leave my grandson alone! He's a good boy!

LASSITER:
Oh, yeah? Then why did he run when he saw us coming?

ALVAREZ:
Because you guys got my face plastered all over the TV for something I didn't do, man. I'm innocent! I don't even think about her anymore.

SHAWN and GUS arrive at the station.

LASSITER:
Yeah, that's what all crazy stalkers say.

SHAWN and GUS run up to them.

SHAWN:
Stop! Just stop. (places his hand on ALVAREZ'S head)

ALVAREZ:
Hey, what the hell?

LASSITER:
What are you doing? Get your hand off him.

GUS:
He's reading his guilt. Give him a second.

SHAWN:
Hamana, Hamana, Hamana, Hamana, (exaggerated Latino accent) Ricky, Enrique, Geraldo, Menudo, Richie! (pulls his hand away as if shocked and falls back against a column)(normal voice) This man is true to his word. He is pure of heart. He's made... many mistakes in his past. Dirty, filthy mistakes. I'm not telling you anything you don't already know here. He didn't attack Deanna.

An officer hands LASSITER a large sealed, evidence bag containing a trophy.

LASSITER:
Really? If he's so pure of heart, why did we find the trophy that she was nearly bludgeoned to death within his car?

Everyone is stunned including ALVAREZ and his GRANDMOTHER. SHAWN looks to JULIET and mouths "What?". She presses her lips together and nods.

EXT. WATERFRONT, DAY

JULIET is sitting on a bench, her back to the water and pier. On her lap is an accordion folder. SHAWN jogs up and sits on the other side and leans back like he's re-enacting a scene from a spy movie.

SHAWN:
The raven crows only at midnight, dusk is for the rooster's cackle.

JULIET:
What?

SHAWN:
Jules, that's your cue to cackle.

JULIET:
Shawn, I don't have a cackle in my repertoire.

SHAWN:
Well, you called for this secret meeting. We should use code speak in case people are listening.

JULIET:
It's not secret. Just away from prying eyes.

SHAWN leaps over the back of the bench so he's sitting next to her.

SHAWN:
So, what do you propose? Should we rent one of those pedal boats that looks like a swan?

JULIET:
We could, or you could just take these. (hands him a file from the folder on her lap)

SHAWN:
What is this?

JULIET:
Copies of the files on Felix Alvarez.

SHAWN:
Why are you giving these to me? (looks through file)

JULIET:
I talked to the kid, his grandmother, and the court-ordered psychiatrist he had to see after breaking into Deanna's house. They all say the months of counseling paid off. He was rehabilitated. And he had a medical condition that required dialysis. My great aunt needed dialysis, and she was always knock-down, drag-out, winter-bear tired afterward.

SHAWN:
And his last appointment probably left him way too "winter-bear tired" to stalk and attack Deanna.

JULIET:
Exactly.

SHAWN:
And just what did the police do when you fed them this peculiar piece of info-gristle?

JULIET:
They spit it out. In fact, they are so certain that he is the guy, they've taken the 24 hour guard off Deanna's hospital room.

A woman seats on the other end of the bench and SHAWN looks at her as she closes the file. He nods to JULIET, gets up and starts walking. JULIET joins him.

SHAWN:
Jules, that's no good. You got to get security back on that door. The killer will come back. He'll try again.

JULIET:
At the very least, her dad is always by her bedside.

SHAWN:
Have you seen that dude? She needs more security than a 60 year old in a tracksuit. Look, without protection, you might as well just send the killer an invitation saying "Hey, come on back, finish the job." I wonder if they make invitations for that.

JULIET:
I don't see why not. You can send an e-vite for anything.

SHAWN:
This is true.

JULIET:
Lassiter thinks it's an "inefficient use of manpower." (hands him another file)

SHAWN:
I'll see what I can divine. What's this?

JULIET:
That's the rest of paperwork on Felix's first break-in. I figured you need all this information to do your psychic stuff.

SHAWN compares the photos from both crime scenes. The first break-in from DEANNA'S bedroom was messy. The second from the apartment is clean, nothing looking out of place.

SHAWN:
(runs his hand over the photos) I can feel these two crimes were not committed by the same person. But, in order for your brothers in blue to be wrong, we're saying Felix was framed. We're saying it was somebody who knew he'd be targeted by the police.

JULIET:
You're saying it. I'm stealthily lending an ear.

SHAWN:
I'm saying it was an excellent, slam-dunk frame-up. This somebody was a pretty bad guy.

JULIET:
(points) Yes.

SHAWN:
Ugly on the inside. Thought of every detail. A virtual hunchbacked mastermind...

JULIET:
Shawn! Just let me know what you find. Remember, psychic intuition's not going to help this guy. Evidence will. Oh, and one more thing. Roosters don't cackle.

SHAWN:
(scoffs) I beg your pardon?

JULIET:
They cock-a-doodle-doo. (walks away)

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, DAY

LASSITER and HENRY are sitting at a table on the porch chatting away having just finished eating the fish they caught earlier. LASSITER is actually not wearing a suit. SHAWN walks into the yard and doesn't know what to make of it.

SHAWN:
You have got to be kidding me.

HENRY:
Shawn! What are you doing here?

SHAWN:
I don't know. I guess I took a wrong turn and ended up in The Twilight Zone. What the hell's going on here?

HENRY:
What? We caught us some lunch this morning.

LASSITER:
Hooked 'em, cooked 'em, and ate 'em.

SHAWN:
How tribal of you.

HENRY:
Shawn never really was one for roughing it. We went camping once, found him curled up inside his sleeping bag because a raccoon was hunting him.

SHAWN:
Stalking me. The raccoon was stalking me, Dad. And I came to talk to you. Alone.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

HENRY takes the dishes to the sink as SHAWN follows him inside.

HENRY:
All righty. So, what's wrong?

SHAWN:
(closes the door) All right, here's the thing.(looks at the fridge and sees a photo of HENRY and LASSITER with a large fish) Whoa! Why is there a picture of Lassiter on your refrigerator?

HENRY:
That's a picture of the fish. I didn't even know he was in there.

HENRY opens the fridge and takes out a bottle of beer as SHAWN goes over to the table.

SHAWN:
What could you guys possibly talk about out there? (sits down and opens the file)

HENRY:
Shawn, that is the beauty part. Nothing. He knows to sit there, shut up, and fish. What, you think we sit out there and we yap about you all day long?

SHAWN:
I can't really wrap my brain around any of it. (spreads the papers on the table)

HENRY:
All right, so what's so important? (drinks his beer)

SHAWN:
I'm working on a case. And I know that they've arrested the wrong guy.

HENRY:
What makes you so sure?

SHAWN:
The MO. This guy in custody, he trashes the girl's house, trashes it, but then, the apartment where they find her is practically sterile. I'm talking about a perfect crime scene. But I cannot find anything in these police reports to back me up.

HENRY:
Right there. You see, right there. That's your first problem.

SHAWN:
What?

HENRY:
The police reports. Shawn, a police report is always from somebody else's point of view. (sits at table) I've written them a ton of them myself, and one thing you cannot do is take them as gospel. All right? So let's run this again. You've been to both crime scenes, right?

SHAWN:
Right. Well, the first one was after the fact, but I've been to both places, yeah.

HENRY:
Okay. So...close your eyes.

SHAWN:
Dad, I didn't come here to take a stupid test. Can't we just talk, as men?

HENRY:
Shawn, would you trust your old man for once, just once? Close your eyes.

SHAWN:
(sighs)Here we go. (closes eyes)

HENRY:
All right, now, I want you to go back to the first crime scene. This poor girl's house. What do you see?

SHAWN:
What do I see? (we see what he sees) Her bed. Tennis trophies. Jewelry box. Mostly nice jewelry. A wall of photos featuring her.

(struggles to remember more)

HENRY:
Come on. Keep going. Keep going, Shawn. What else?

SHAWN:
There is nothing else. The guy was there way before me. Everything looks different now. (opens eyes)

HENRY:
Okay, okay, now let's go to the second crime scene. To this apartment where she was found.

SHAWN:
Can we stop on the way and get donuts?

HENRY:
Shawn, focus. Keep your eyes closed. What do you see?

SHAWN revisits the scene and "sees" the cheap necklace on the floor and the PHOTOGRAPHER shooting pictures out the window. He also sees the shadow cast by the lamp against the wall as measured by a frame.

SHAWN:
(opens eyes) Wait a minute. (looks at the crime scene photos of the shadows and laughs as he stands and gathers the file) Thank you, Dad. I have a crime scene to break into.

HENRY stretches out and SHAWN slaps his hand as he leaves. HENRY puts his arms behind his head and his feet on the chair vacated by SHAWN.

INT. DEANNA'S APARTMENT, DAY

SHAWN opens the door to the apartment and ducks under the criss-crossed police tape. A crouching GUS closes the door quickly behind him.

GUS:
I can't believe you pulled me out of my retreat. I can kiss my chances of getting Dr. Feelgood on my route goodbye.

SHAWN looks at the clocks in the room and they both read 11:15.

SHAWN:
Gus, what time do you have?

GUS:
Where's your watch at?

SHAWN:
It's a key tanning month.

SHAWN walks to one window leaving the crime scene photo at the corresponding area.

GUS:
(checks watch) 2:15.

SHAWN:
2:15. Right. (moves to other window) That's around the same time we were here before. (sticks photo of outside on the window) So why are all these clocks wrong? (sets other photos on the table by the lamp and one on the shelf) Dude, I need you to lay on the ground.
Pretend like you're Deanna.

GUS:
I'm not pretending to be a woman half beaten to death, Shawn.

SHAWN:
You know what? I'm starting to wonder if you have serious trust issues with me.

GUS:
Really?

SHAWN:
Yes. First, you wouldn't do the minefield. Now, you won't lay on the floor and pretend to be an unconscious woman for me. What's going on with you?

GUS:
Two words. Airwolf windbreaker.

SHAWN:
Okay. Two more. Airwolf windbreaker.

GUS:
Battleship.

SHAWN:
Dude, that was like a million years ago.

GUS:
I'm just saying.

SHAWN:
I never cheated again. Now, can we please just do this?

GUS:
What is the point of me pretending to be Deanna?

SHAWN:
Something here is weird, okay? When I was with my dad, I realized that the shadows coming off those two lamps were in the wrong spots. I think someone tampered with this crime scene.

GUS:
Tamp... Who could do that?

SHAWN:
Someone smart. Someone experienced. Which is why we need to recreate the scene so that it is exactly the way it was when the cops got here.

GUS:
All right, fine.

SHAWN:
Fine. Now, in the landlord's statement, he said the body was found here in the supine position, so, please, if you will...

GUS:
Sure. Just tell me what supine means.

SHAWN:
Gus, supine. Su...

GUS:
Mmm-hmm.

SHAWN:
...pine.

GUS:
You don't know what the word means, do you?

SHAWN:
Okay, fine. You win. Mr. Vocabulary wins. (applauds) Mr. Vocab is the big winner tonight, everybody.

GUS:
Thank you. No, please, please, please. (pretends to accept applause from a crowd) It means on your back. (drops to the floor and lies on his back with a sigh and crosses his legs)

SHAWN:
I knew that.

SHAWN goes over to the window and checks the photo of the shadows against the real thing.

GUS:
No, you didn't.

SHAWN:
Okay. This is off. The lamp is in the same spot, but the shadows aren't. And something else is wrong. (moves over to the shelves and checks that photo) There are six pictures on this bookshelf. There are six pictures in this photo.

GUS:
What do you expect?

SHAWN:
Seven. I clearly remember seven photos, Gus. There were two pictures on each shelf, and one shelf with one. That's seven. It was right here, where this box is.

GUS:
(sits on the floor) Can you remember what's in the missing photo?

SHAWN:
(brings up the memory of the missing photo) I'm not... sure.

The door opens and the LANDLORD comes in. GUS pretends to be dead.

LANDLORD:
What the hell's going on?

SHAWN:
(coolly) Nothing, man.

LANDLORD:
Nothing? Is that guy dead?

SHAWN:
(sighs) Damn it. Now you've seen too much.

LANDLORD:
(stammers) I didn't see anything.

SHAWN:
Yeah, you did. You're in this just as deep as I am now. We're going to have to work together.

LANDLORD:
(nervously) Okay?

SHAWN:
I assume this building has an incinerator. Yeah?

LANDLORD:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Okay. So we just have to chop up the body, and, uh,  we put the limbs in little plastic baggies. The torso we're going to have to melt down with a blowtorch...

GUS:
Okay, I've heard enough (gets up)

The LANDLORD runs from the apartment.

GUS:
"Chop up his body"? And then you wonder why I don't trust you. Are we done yet?

SHAWN:
(looks out the window) One last thing.

SHAWN compares the photo of the Indian restaurant to what it looks like at the moment.

GUS:
Hurry up, Shawn.

SHAWN then sees that the lights in the trees outside the restaurant are on in the photo but not at present. He dashes out of the apartment and GUS follows.

EXT. RESTAURANT, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk up to the entrance.

GUS:
Shawn, I left my retreat to solve a crime, not to order takeout.

SHAWN:
That's exactly what we're doing.

A HOSTESS wearing a sari is clearing some plates.

SHAWN:
Hi there. What time do you turn those lights on?

HOSTESS:
At 5:00, for the beginning of the dinner crowd.

SHAWN:
Never any earlier, for any reason whatsoever?

HOSTESS:
It's on a timer.

GUS:
(whispers) What the hell is the point?

SHAWN:
(whispers) I think I know who the killer is. (normal voice) One more question, and this is absolutely critical. Do your samosas come with that red onion chutney?

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK, JULIET and LASSITER are sitting at the table.

LASSITER:
I arraigned Felix today. If he's smart, he'll just plead out. So next is... Jiminy Crickets. What?

GUS has opened the door for SHAWN who is in the midst of an "episode".

GUS:
He's sensing an anomaly in the space-time continuum.

SHAWN:
It's very serious. It can unravel the fabric of reality itself. We've been trailing it from across town. The distortion is near. (JULIET sneezes) Bless you.

JULIET:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
It's in the photos, in the files! (GUS grabs the file and hands it to SHAWN who rubs his hand over it) Yes. The photos are lying. That is the anomaly. It was the distortion that prevented me from divining dirty Deanna's attacker, but now... now I have a clear image.

LASSITER:
We already know who attacked her.

VICK:
He's right, Mr. Spencer.

SHAWN:
He's wrong. The bludgeoner's close. (hands the folder to GUS)  Follow me.

SHAWN leaves and the others follow.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN runs his hands in front of random people he comes across as if feeling their aura.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN puts his hands on the head of one of the men at a desk

SHAWN:
Yes... no. No.

SHAWN makes his way to the PHOTOGRAPHER'S desk and reaches his hand out towards him but pulls back with a gasp.

SHAWN:
(points) Bludgeoner.

LASSITER:
What are you, nuts? He works for us!

The PHOTOGRAPHER stands up. SHAWN goes into another vision.

SHAWN:
The photos... look at the photos. Jules, Jules, Jules, what's going on with the lights in the background, in the window?

JULIET:
(checks file) Oh, he's right. The lights in the restaurant are on in these photos. They were off when we found Deanna.

LASSITER:
(grabs photo) What?

PHOTOGRAPHER:
This is crazy. Why would I attack some woman I've never met before?

GUS:
Never met? Didn't you photograph her house when the Felix guy broke in?

SHAWN:
Yes, that's when you met her! Aw, Dude! She liked meeting new people, she liked to party, and she liked to have her photo taken, and guess who takes photos for a living. You! And it was nice, and it was on, and you were giving it to her, and she liked it until she met somebody who
could afford to buy her nicer jewelry than you. She was on her way to see him in Tokyo. You decided to confront her at her apartment. (we see the moment in the apartment) Hey, trophy! Bam! And then you cleaned it all up... and you made it nice, and you left a perfect crime scene. And you came back here and assumed your capacity as police photographer. You scrutinized the photos, making sure there was no trace of your presence in that apartment. Oversight. This bag... (jabs equipment bag with his finger) sure enough, in a photo on her bookshelf. Your bag with your initials that the police have seen a million times. They'd have known it was you. So, what did you do? You waited for the forensics guys to split, and you snuck back inside. Oh, you were so meticulous. You took the time to turn the clocks back to the right time, and you re-photographed the whole scene without the incriminating photo, and you re-submitted those as the originals. But I can feel that you forgot to reset the clocks to the correct time before leaving. Gus... (collapses into a chair with a whimper)

VICK:
Take him into custody until we figure this whole thing out.

Two officers take the PHOTOGRAPHER away. The detectives walk away leaving SHAWN and GUS alone.

GUS:
(dramatically) So, the prophecy's been fulfilled.

SHAWN:
What? What are you talking about? What prophecy?

GUS:
Nothing. I just figured it was finally my chance to say something dramatic.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN runs into the yard and sees HENRY asleep, stretched out over two chairs.

SHAWN:
Fire!

HENRY is startled awake.

SHAWN:
Hey, Pop!

HENRY:
Shawn, God... (smacks at him with the newspaper)

SHAWN:
(sits) What, are you sleeping one off?

HENRY:
No. I couldn't sleep last night. My back's all out of whack. (reaches for his tackle box and sets it on his lap) Hey, I hear they...they arrested one of the forensics guys.

SHAWN:
Yep. They grilled him like panini. He confessed to the whole thing. And the police found a fake hospital badge at his apartment. They think he was going to try to kill her last night.

HENRY:
How's the girl?

SHAWN:
The doctors say she's going to pull through.

LASSITER walks up the path wearing a suit and carrying a pole.

HENRY:
There he is. You're not going to go out like that, are you?

LASSITER:
Yeah. I can't make it tonight. I've got to work a double. (sets down pole) Hey, I know. Why don't you take Junior here? I'll catch you next week. (starts to walk away)

SHAWN:
Whoa! (gets up and follows after) What are you talking about? Didn't you just work back-to-back shifts on that tennis thing?

LASSITER:
Okay, fine. You got me, all right? He's actually capable of taking all the fun out of fishing. He criticized my pole technique for like three hours. It's holding a pole in the water. What is there to criticize?

SHAWN:
(smiles at LASSITER'S discomfort but defends HENRY) Hey, ease up. That's my pop you're talking about.

LASSITER:
I'm beginning to understand you a little better, Spencer. (leaves)

EXT. PARK, DAY

SHAWN and GUS return to the retreat as everyone is leaving.

TOM:
Burton, you're back.

GUS:
Sorry I missed today's program, sir.

TOM:
Well, it's okay. I tried out a new trust exercise where I pull a rubber band back as far as I can, and I hold it up to my trust partner's eye, and I say "Do you trust me? Do you trust me?"

GUS:
Wow. How did that go?

TOM:
I wish my grip was better. But the cornea is resilient.

SHAWN:
That's true, Tom. I've heard that. Now, Burton here hates to drag his personal life into work matters, but I feel like you should know his dear grandmother somehow managed to dislocate both of her shoulders, too. I think it was the chin-ups she was trying to do on the traction bar.

TOM:
Burton, you have missed almost every exercise we had arranged for this weekend. You left a work function to tend to your ailing grandmother, even if it was detrimental to your career. You know what that tells me? It tells me you really care about people.

GUS:
I do.

SHAWN:
He does.

TOM:
And after getting in touch with my feelings this weekend, I think that's exactly what the Central Coast Pharmaceutical Company is all about.

SHAWN:
Yes.

GUS:
Okay.

SHAWN:
And... Burton's grandmother's going to need a little extra caring after. He would never complain, because I know he loves this job, but if there was any way that his route could be a little less...

TOM:
Save your breath. Burton, I know that everybody here wants to get Dr. Magnotti. Why don't you swap him out for a couple of your less productive clients?

GUS:
Oh, wow. Wow. (shakes TOM'S hand) Thank you, Tom. My grandmother thanks you, as a matter of fact.

TOM:
Well, I tell you what. Once she's feeling better, I want you two to come on over to my house and have dinner with my wife and I.

GUS:
Oh, no. No, we couldn't. We couldn't.

TOM:
Lizzie makes a fondue that'll knock your socks off. Block of cheese about the size of a house cat. We're going to melt it down and gobble it up.

GUS:
Okay.

TOM:
All right.

GUS:
Yeah, sure. We'd be honored.

TOM:
(to SHAWN) And don't be such a stranger.

SHAWN:
Hello, Tom! Hello!

TOM leaves.

GUS:
I'm so screwed.

SHAWN:
Why?

GUS:
He wants to meet my grandmother.

SHAWN:
So?

GUS:
So, you know one of them is dead and the other one's in Jamaica.

SHAWN:
Dude, relax. I know like five people that could easily play your grandmother.

GUS:
Okay, so you know a line-dancing octogenarian who could do chin-ups and has two broken hips?

SHAWN:
Yeah, as long as she can be Chinese. Just trust me.

GUS:
Never mind. (starts to walk away)

SHAWN:
You do trust me, right? (jogs after GUS) I mean, I know it's a silly thing to say after all these years, but we don't have to do these kinds of exercises, do we? (GUS doesn't answer) Battleship rematch?

GUS:
You know that's right.

Episode 1x14 Poker? I Barely Know Her!

1985

INT. SBPD, LOCKER ROOM, DAY

Some off-duty cops are playing poker. The camera pans from one to the next, face level.

MAN 1:
I'll raise. I've got a good feeling about this hand.

MAN 2:
Too rich for me. Fold.

MAN 3:
Big surprise, rookie. That's all you ever do, is fold. Call. What do you say to that, big shot?

MAN 3 turns his head and the camera moves over but there is no one there. The camera then moves down to show SHAWN. The camera angle changes to show him sitting cross-legged on the bench they are using as a table.

SHAWN:
I say... (he looks at each of the men in turn, catching their tells) The last card didn't make Mr. O'Grady's flush. Mr. Duritz was smart to fold, because he missed his straight... And you, Mr. Hastings, your cards just stink. You're bluffing. I call (throws his money on the table) Two pair, jacks and sevens.

O'GRADY:
Oh, damn! Every time.

HASTINGS:
You'd think we'd know better by now.

HENRY:
What the hell is going on here?

The men make themselves scarce. SHAWN sits on the bench as HENRY chastises him.

HENRY:
Poker, Shawn? Poker? What were you thinking?

SHAWN:
I don't know. I get bored waiting.

HENRY:
Why didn't you just say so? I mean, if you're bored, I guess it's okay. What is wrong with you? (straddles the bench) How do you even know how to play poker?

SHAWN:
Mr. Hastings taught me.

HENRY:
Hastings, huh? I want it to stop. You understand? No more poker. No more gambling. You're too young.

SHAWN:
Dad, I don't gamble. I win.

HENRY:
You win? And approximately how often do you lose?

SHAWN:
I don't know.

HENRY:
You don't know?

SHAWN:
Well, I haven't lost yet.

HENRY:
How... how... how much did you win?

SHAWN stands and empties his pockets of wrinkled bills.

HENRY:
Is that it?

SHAWN reaches into a pocket and pulls out some more money.

HENRY:
All right, son, listen to me. Just because you can do something doesn't always mean that you should do it. (gathers the money) Do you understand what I'm saying?

SHAWN:
No.

HENRY holds up the wad of bills before standing and walking away.

SHAWN:
Hey, that's mine!

HENRY:
Not anymore. (puts money in donation box)

SHAWN:
Yes, it is!

HENRY:
Uh-Uh, no. No, no, no, I'm giving it away. (walks back to SHAWN) I'm giving it away. Why? Because I can, and according to your little philosophy, your poker philosophy, if I can, then I should. Right? (lifts SHAWN onto the bench) I know it might seem like you're going to win every time, Shawn, but no matter how good you are, there's always somebody who's better. And there's one rule in gambling, the house always wins. Eventually. Do you understand what I'm saying?

SHAWN:
Don't gamble?

HENRY:
Not for money.

PRESENT DAY

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is sitting at his desk while GUS is throwing wadded balls of paper at the basketball hoop set over the trash basket.

GUS:
I got 10 bucks says you can't make this shot. (makes the shot)

SHAWN:
Gus, I can't take your money.

GUS:
That's right, because you can't make the shot.

SHAWN:
I could easily make the shot, which is why I can't take your money. There's no sport in it.

GUS:
I say you're all mouth.

SHAWN:
I'm all mouth?

GUS:
Yup.

SHAWN:
All right.

SHAWN rips a page out of the magazine he's reading and scoots over to GUS in his desk chair. GUS hands him a paper ball and SHAWN wraps his piece of paper around it before standing.

SHAWN:
(clears throat) Sail straight, my precious. (kisses the ball before throwing it into the basket)

GUS:
Okay. Double or nothing. Trivia question this time. History.

SHAWN:
Grover Cleveland.

GUS:
Damn! How do you do that?

SHAWN:
It's the sweetness.

HENRY has entered the office without either of them noticing.

HENRY:
So, this is how you spend your days.

SHAWN:
Oh, my God! Dad, what are you doing here?

HENRY:
Nice. Is that the way you greet all the people that come through your door?

SHAWN:
That's exactly how I greet everyone. Maybe that's why business is down.

GUS:
Hmm.

HENRY:
Are you going to invite me in?

GUS:
(walks forward) Oh, yeah, please...

SHAWN:
(stops GUS) Whoa! This could be a trick. What's the rule?

GUS:
What are you talking about, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Gus, you've seen Lost Boys 14 times. What's the rule?

GUS:
You're on your own. (walks to his desk)

HENRY:
(walks in and looks around) Is this is all there is?

SHAWN:
Actually, this is the satellite office. Main headquarters is in an underground ice cave Gus and I sculpted last winter.

HENRY:
What about your license?

SHAWN:
(clears throat) My pilot's license? It's out back in the CESSNA, or perhaps you're referring to my license to kill. Revoked. Problems at the Kazakhstan border. I could give details, but then I'd have to kill you, which I can't do because my license to kill has been revoked.

HENRY:
I'm talking about your private eye license. (tosses a baseball at SHAWN) Well, you need one, don't you?

GUS:
Psychics are exempt from the requirements.

HENRY:
Oh, well, hooray for loopholes.

SHAWN leans against the front of GUS' desk tossing the baseball as HENRY walks around the office criticizing the little things.

HENRY:
A little dark. Could use a couple more lamps. You're probably killing your eyes. That outlet... looks a little overloaded. That plasma... you'd probably do better by putting it on that wall. You'd have less glare coming in through the window in the afternoon...

SHAWN:
You know, Dad, I really appreciate you making the long drive down to Feng Shui it up sweet for us, but we're kind of in the middle of something here.

HENRY:
What would that be, Shawn? Would that be NBA garbage can hoops, (takes one of the paper balls out of the garbage to put it through the hoop) or trivia super-challenge?

SHAWN:
Believe it or not, we have an 11:00. So maybe we should wrap this up.

HENRY:
Ah, it's a little too late for that, Shawn. (sits in SHAWN'S abandoned chair and smiles) I am your 11:00.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

HENRY walks the room explaining while he's there as SHAWN takes his chair back and wheels it behind the desk. He puts his feet up on the desk as GUS sits on the corner.

HENRY:
Bill Peterson. He owns Peterson Motors. I met him about 20 years ago when I grabbed a couple of punks boosting tires off of his lot. Shawn, shouldn't you be writing some of this down?

SHAWN:
Why would I do that? Will there be a quiz?

HENRY:
Would you shut up and pay attention? I got a call from him yesterday. He's got a kid. Brandon. He's just a little younger than you. He thinks his son might be mixed up in something.

GUS:
Like what?

HENRY:
He'll fill you in when he gets here. The point is, he doesn't want cops involved, so he called me.

SHAWN:
And you said...

HENRY:
I said I'm retired, and he should definitely involve the cops.

SHAWN:
Sweet. You came all the way here to tell us that. Awesome.

HENRY:
No, Shawn. He doesn't want his son in trouble, and I might have mentioned to Peterson, accidentally, that you, uh... You might be able to help.

SHAWN:
Whoa, time out! Flag on the play! Did you vouch for me?

HENRY:
No, I wouldn't say I exactly vouched for you.

SHAWN:
Gus, Henry vouched for me. (stands and walks over to HENRY)

HENRY:
I did not vouch for you.

SHAWN:
You were bragging on me. You have a dad-crush on me. (holds out his arms and wiggles his fingers, inviting a hug)

HENRY:
Shawn, I was not bragging on you. I merely restated stats about your track record that are in the newspaper.

SHAWN:
Let's hug it out.

HENRY:
Put your arms down.

SHAWN:
Give me hug.

HENRY:
Put your... No, I'm not going to give you a... If I had known that Peterson was going to insist on hiring you, I would have blasted your character outright, and I would have mentioned your unnatural fear of pointy things.

SHAWN:
Ah! Distaste for pointy things.

HENRY:
Please, just do me this one favor. Would you listen to the man's story, tell him you can't help, send him to the cops, and whatever you do, don't do it with all that rolling your eyes around and all that (flaps arms around) floppy crap.

SHAWN:
What is this? First of all, I don't flop around all the time, okay? My game is predicated on finesse. How dare you criticise my job.

The front door opens.

HENRY:
He's here. He's here. Don't tell him I came by. Do you got a back way out this place?

SHAWN:
You came through it.

HENRY:
Oh, right. (runs out the back way)

PETERSON clears his throat before knocking on the door to the inner office.

PETERSON:
Excuse me. Are you Shawn?

SHAWN:
Yes, that's correct, Mr. Peterson. (twitches)

PETERSON:
Wow, that is my name.

SHAWN:
Don't be too impressed, Bill. I could've gotten that information anywhere. After all, Peterson Motors is gigantic.

PETERSON:
Yeah, well, I'm suitably impressed. (shakes SHAWN'S hand)

GUS:
Don't be. Burton Guster. (shakes PETERSON'S hand)

PETERSON:
Pleasure to meet you. (sits on the edge of SHAWN'S desk) Look, I'll get right to it. I have a son, Brandon. Up until a few weeks ago, he worked for me. Now he's disappeared.

GUS:
What happened a few weeks ago?

PETERSON:
I fired him. He was lazy, directionless. I thought I could get him to buckle down, focus in on something.

SHAWN:
How did that go?

PETERSON:
Well, he's been evicted from his apartment, his cellphone's been cut off, and he forged a check from my account to the tune of $30,000. (stands) I need to find my son. Can you help me?

GUS:
Well, Mr. Peterson, this sounds like a case for the police. Let me get you a number.

SHAWN:
Gus, don't be a gooey chocolate chip cookie.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
This is precisely what we do here, sir. We find people. We'll find your Brandon.

SHAWN starts shaking and trembling until GUS slaps him on the back.

INT. SBPD, DAY

JULIET is walking down the hall talking with a uniformed officer.

JULIET:
Okay, make sure we are not disturbed. I need five minutes uninterrupted. Make sure no one comes in.

OFFICER:
Yeah.

JULIET enters VICK'S office, shuts the door. LASSITER looks at her before she closes the blinds. The OFFICER takes position at the door.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

JULIET walks over to VICK.

VICK:
What's with all the secrecy, O'Hara?

JULIET:
I've got a real mindbender.

VICK:
Problem with the railway theft?

JULIET:
No. It's a detective.

VICK:
Is this something for Internal Affairs?

JULIET:
It's Detective Lassiter.

VICK:
What's the problem with our head detective?

JULIET:
Well, it's his birthday.

VICK:
Oh, that's not a problem.

JULIET:
Yeah! It is! He seems quiet.

VICK:
He is quiet. That's who he is. O'Hara I think it's nice that you care for your partner, but he's a grown man. He'll be fine.

JULIET:
I just thought it would be nice to surprise him.

VICK:
Oh... Detective Lassiter does not like surprises.

JULIET:
Of course he likes surprises. Everybody likes surprises.

VICK:
Detective Lassiter has a very particular comfort zone, and you don't even want to know what we now call the (whispers) "Secret Santa Debacle of 2005."

JULIET:
I just wanted to do something nice for him, but nobody seems to know what he likes.

VICK:
Well, you're his partner. Shouldn't you know?

JULIET:
Well, we don't really talk. I mean, he doesn't. He nods and responds, mostly. He never really poses a question. Although, sometimes he asks if we can ride in silence.

VICK:
O'Hara, your heart is in the right place, but I am very sure you will have to do this yourself.

JULIET:
(sighs) Okay, fine. (leaves)

EXT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT BUILDING, DAY

GUS parks the car in front of the building and they get out and walk to the front door.

GUS:
Shawn, what are we doing here? Brandon's dad said he was evicted.

They stop on the porch, outside the door.

SHAWN:
Gus, let me ask you something. When's the last time you were evicted from your apartment?

GUS:
(scoffs) Never.

The door opens and SHAWN holds it as a woman steps out. SHAWN waves as she walks by.

SHAWN:
Exactly. You wouldn't understand. This is my world.

They walk through the door and into the complex.

INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT BUILDING, PARKING GARAGE, DAY

SHAWN leads GUS to a storage compartment built of wood and lined with chicken wire.

SHAWN:
So the landlord keeps Brandon's stuff as collateral. Brandon comes back, landlord gets paid. Brandon doesn't, there's a garage sale.

GUS:
Well, the buzzer upstairs says that his is 227.

SHAWN:
227? Marla Gibbs.

GUS:
Regina King.

SHAWN:
Jack√©e.

GUS:
Hal Williams.

SHAWN:
Hal Williams?

GUS:
Hal Williams as Lester Jenkins.

SHAWN:
Yeah, right. (looks at the padlock and sees scratches around the keyhole) Looks like somebody took a screwdriver to this thing.

GUS:
Let me see.

SHAWN walks around to the other side of the locker as GUS looks at the lock.

GUS:
Okay, so Brandon needed something inside here, but he couldn't get in. If you were in his shoes, what would you do next?

SHAWN:
(grips the chicken wire) First of all, I'd feel very ashamed of myself.

GUS:
Tell me about it.

SHAWN looks down at the floor and sees marks on an envelope and then an open space near the base of the wire where it meets the wood.

SHAWN:
But then, (moves back to stand next to GUS) I think I'd come back with some scissors. (lies on the floor and reaches through the hole, GUS beside him) Let's see if we can find what he was reaching for.

GUS:
Here, let me reach. (puts his arm through the hole as well) My reach is better.

SHAWN:
Excuse me.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
When exactly did we have a reaching contest?

GUS:
My reach has always been better.

SHAWN:
But my arms are slender-erer. Slender-er?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Slenderer...

GUS:
Skinnier?

SHAWN:
Yes.

GUS:
You know what? You're right. My biceps probably wouldn't fit through this thing anyway. (pulls arm out)

SHAWN:
I knew you'd fall for that.

SHAWN reaches the box of envelopes with an exaggerated grunt. He and GUS kneel and go through the papers.

GUS:
Let's see. Final notice, final notice, final notice, plus an eviction? Gosh, this kid has some serious cash-flow problems. No wonder why he stole from his pops. What do you got?

SHAWN:
A bunch of pawn shops. Whoa, wait a second. If you're a guy with an apartment, what's the one thing you definitely don't have?

GUS:
I don't know, a horse?

SHAWN:
A horse, that's true! (imitates buzzer) Answer we were looking for was yard or garden. I would have accepted both yard... and garden.

GUS:
I was joking.

SHAWN:
So if you're a guy without a yard or garden...

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
...why would you have a business card for a garden supply store?

SHAWN holds up the card in front of GUS who notices writing on the back.

GUS:
What is R,R,L,R,L,L?

SHAWN:
(reads card) Rrlrll. Rrlrll.

GUS:
Of course, "rrila rilla."

SHAWN:
No, no. (rolls the Rs) Rrlrll. Rrlrll.

GUS:
What does it mean?

SHAWN:
We should probably figure that out, huh?

GUS:
You think?

EXT. GARDEN CENTER, PARKING LOT, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are sitting in the car watching the customers.

GUS:
How long are we going to sit here? Brandon might not even show up. When I suggested we do a stakeout, You were like, "No, no. We need to do something active."

SHAWN:
I am doing something active.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I'm preparing to try and enjoy this chalupa. (prepares to eat)

GUS:
Odd.

SHAWN watches as a silver sports car pulls into a parking space.

SHAWN:
No, what's odd is the customers that keep driving into this place. Look at these cars. They're ridiculous. They're all fancy and whatnot.

GUS:
Not exactly what you would use to pick up shrubs and fertilizer.

They watch as the driver gets out and walks around to the passenger side. A woman hands him his wallet and waves as he goes inside.

SHAWN:
Let's see what these people are up to.

SHAWN puts down the chalupa and he and GUS get out of the car. They walk past the silver car and SHAWN looks at the charm bracelet on the woman's wrist - it is made to be a straight flush with diamonds, the real thing.

EXT. GARDEN CENTER, DAY

SHAWN and GUS follow the man through the garden center to the open area in the back. He pauses in front of a trellis by some hedges and looks around carefully. GUS and SHAWN duck down behind some flowers and watch him disappear inside. They stand.

GUS:
Let's go.

They cross over to the area and go the same direction as the man they were following. They peer around a corner and see the path is clear. They turn right and come upon a dead end.

GUS:
Wrong turn.

They go back to where they turned and then go in the other direction. They come back.

GUS:
What the...

SHAWN:
Dude, it's a maze. (flashes back to finding the card with the writing on the back)

They make their way back to the entrance of the maze and SHAWN recalls the letters as GUS watches.

GUS:
Shawn, what are you doing?

SHAWN:
Right, left, right... Dude, the letters on the back of that card were directions. Follow me.

GUS:
All right.

SHAWN and GUS enter the maze.

SHAWN:
(pauses) Right. (makes the turn and stops) Rrlrll... Rrlrll, rrlrll.

GUS:
Sh-Shawn!

SHAWN:
Right. (continues) Left... Left... Yes! (goes to open the door they find)

GUS:
Whoa, wait a second, wait a second. Maybe we should take a peek and see what we're getting into, Shawn.

They push the bushes aside and peer through. Inside are a number of tables where people are playing cards.

GUS:
Oh, you know what this is, Shawn? It's one of those underground poker games. My poker buddies talk about them.

SHAWN:
Since when do you have poker buddies?

GUS:
My online poker buddies, Shawn. I'm good. I'm up $7 million.

SHAWN:
You have $7 million, and you failed to mention it until just now?

GUS:
It's not real money, Shawn. That's illegal.

One of the men playing poker has just lost big. One of the men running the game comes over.

MAN 1:
Rough luck there, again, huh?

MAN 2:
Yeah, a bit of bad luck.

SHAWN:
Dude, you should get in this game.

GUS:
How? These games are tight. You got to know somebody to get in.

SHAWN:
Oh, we'll just throw Brandon's name around. Maybe they'll let us in.

MAN 2:
Uh, yeah, one more hand, I'll get it.

MAN 1:
It's not working out for you today, is it?

MAN 2:
No. Not right now.

MAN 1:
I'll tell you what. (snaps his fingers) Why don't you stand up here?

Two large men come up behind the player.

MAN 2:
I'm just gonna...

MAN 1:
Come on. Come here.

The two men lift the poker player up by the arms and hold him still as he faces MAN 1.

MAN 1:
It's okay. It's okay. (pats MAN 2 on the chest)

MAN 2:
Okay.

MAN 1:
Just relax, now. Put your hand up like this.(holds hand up as if waiting for a High Five)

MAN 2:
Why?

MAN 1:
Just hold it up. There you go.

One of the men holds MAN 2's hand up as MAN 1 turns around and picks up a pair of garden clippers.

MAN 1:
Now, maybe next time, you won't force me into such a barbaric form of retribution.

SHAWN:
Good news. There appears to be a seat opening up. Still, I think our best course of action would be to...

GUS:
Get the hell out of here!

SHAWN:
Go, go, go, go!

They run away.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

HENRY and PETERSON are sitting in the soft chairs as SHAWN comes in with headphones over his ears. GUS is behind him.

SHAWN:
(loudly) I want you to know I cannot hear anything you say!

HENRY and PETERSON stand up and walk over.

HENRY:
Shawn, what the hell is going on? What the... Shawn what are you doing?

SHAWN walks right past him.

GUS:
It's his ongoing sensory-deprivation experiment, sharpening one sense by denying others. In this case, he can't hear, which amplifies his sense of smell.

HENRY:
(whispers) What?

PETERSON:
Amazing.

HENRY:
That's one word for it.

SHAWN:
I need complete and utter silence.

HENRY:
What do you need silence for Shawn, if you can't hear anything?

GUS:
Shh!

PETERSON:
Please, Henry, let the boy work.

SHAWN:
I smell chips! Potato! Pot-Ah-To! Let's call the whole thing off. (throws a bag of potato chips to GUS) Mr. Peterson, I want you to grab my arm. (holds his arm straight out in front of PETERSON) Both hands, like you're doing a pull-up. Feel the burn. (PETERSON puts his hands on SHAWN'S arm) I will now become a conduit to your son's thoughts. Please, clear your mind and your nasal passages. Think of nothing but Brandon and those chips. Gus, present spuds. (GUS holds the bag in front of PETERSON who sniffs the contents) I'm getting something. (starts moving arm) It's not clear...

HENRY:
(pushes GUS' arm away) That's a shocker.

SHAWN:
I'm wrong! It's not potato! Gus, lose the spuds! (GUS puts the potato chips down) Chips... Ponch! John! Striker! Cracker! Poker! Poker? I hardly know her!

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Poker chips!

HENRY:
Well, what the hell do poker chips smell like, Shawn?

SHAWN:
They smell like butterflies. Poker chips... and playing cards!

SHAWN reaches over and grabs a deck of cards from GUS' desk. PETERSON is still holding onto his arm.

PETERSON:
What? What about the poker chips and the playing cards?

SHAWN:
(holds up the cards) Oh, Gus, it burns! (jerks his body around and throws the cards down on the floor with a grunt before pulling off the headphones) The link... has been broken. I'll have to read the cards, see what they say.

SHAWN tosses away the headphones and gets down on the floor. GUS gets down as well, so does PETERSON. SHAWN reaches up and yanks HENRY down by his shirt.

HENRY:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
(holds up the jack of hearts) There's your son. Notice there are no diamonds around him.

GUS:
Well, diamonds represent wealth. So Brandon lost his wealth playing poker?

SHAWN:
That's correct, Gus.

HENRY:
Well, what do all these clubs around him mean, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Clubs... clubs are like... clover. He's been playing poker in a garden. (picks up the king of diamonds) With this guy. We need a name. Has he mentioned any of the guys he plays poker with?

PETERSON:
Dumbluck2. That was his online screen name. I kept seeing it on his computer when he was supposed to be working.

SHAWN:
(looks at GUS) Dumbluck2. Here, you can have Brandon. (hands jack of hearts to PETERSON)

PETERSON:
Thanks.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET glances at LASSITER'S open personnel file as she makes a phone call to her partner's mother.

MRS. LASSITER:
(over phone) Hello?

JULIET:
Hi. Mrs. Lassiter?

MRS. LASSITER:
(over phone) Yes. Who is this? What do you want?

JULIET:
It's about your son...

MRS. LASSITER:
(over phone) Oh, no! It's the phone call!

JULIET:
Oh, no, no, no, no, it's not that. (sits)

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. MRS. LASSITER'S HOUSE, DAY

MRS. LASSITER is sitting down wearing a plum velour housecoat.

MRS. LASSITER:
Well, then, who the hell are you?

JULIET:
I'm his partner.

MRS. LASSITER:
But... you're a woman.

JULIET:
(sarcastic) Yes. Shocking, isn't it?

MRS. LASSITER:
What are you, fulfilling a quota? If you get him shot...

JULIET:
I'm not getting him shot. I just need to ask a few personal questions.

MRS. LASSITER:
Personal questions? You're not a cop. This is some kind of internet scam, isn't it? You'll want my social security number next, right? Well, suck lemons, Cookiepuss. You're getting nothing out of me.

JULIET:
No. No, no, no. It's just... it's his birthday. It's coming up, and I...

MRS. LASSITER:
Who told you that?

JULIET:
Excuse me?

MRS. LASSITER:
Booker doesn't celebrate his birthdays.

JULIET:
(snickers) Booker?

MRS. LASSITER:
Dammit! Ooh, you're good, Trickypants. Well, I just want you to know this phone call is now being recorded.

JULIET:
(whispers) I just need some inside information because I want to surprise him.

MRS. LASSITER:
Why are you asking me? Why don't you ask his wife?

JULIET:
I didn't exactly think that was appropriate with them being separated and all.

MRS. LASSITER:
They're what?

JULIET:
Nothing.

MRS. LASSITER:
My son is separated?

JULIET:
No... I mean, I don't know. Please don't tell him that you know. Please don't tell him that I told you. I really... I had no idea. Can we please just pretend this conversation never happened? (there's a dial tone on the other end) Hello? (hangs up and puts a hand over her mouth)

Over her shoulder we see LASSITER at his desk. He answers his phone as it rings.

LASSITER:
Lassiter. Mother? What? What do you mean you want your wedding ring back?

JULIET grabs her purse and quickly leaves.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS is sitting on his desk playing on his computer.

SHAWN:
What are you doing?

GUS:
I'm playing online poker, Shawn. I knew I knew that name. Dumbluck2. I've played Brandon before. Right here, and I beat him. I figured I'd hang out, see if he logs on.

SHAWN:
(sees GUS' eye twitch) Looks like a full house, huh?

GUS:
How did you know that?

SHAWN:
You went... (exaggerates the twitch)

GUS:
I don't do that, Shawn. I didn't do that.

As GUS continues to play, SHAWN gets comfortable, leaning back in a chair, feet on GUS' desk. He watches his friend.

SHAWN:
Two pair. I'd call, and raise. You're sitting on pocket rockets. You won't do better than that.

GUS:
Seriously, how do you do that?

SHAWN:
Good thing you're not a real poker player. You'd lose more money than Brandon.

GUS:
I am a stellar player, Shawn. And don't think... Wait a second.

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
He's on now. Brandon.

SHAWN:
Great. Bring him in.

SHAWN pushes his chair around next to GUS, pushing him out of the way to look at the computer.

GUS:
Bring him in how? Say "Hey, Brandon, your dad's looking for you"?

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second here, time out.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
You're "BigKitty75"?

GUS:
Yeah. As in, the kitty, you know, the pot.

SHAWN:
The kitty?

GUS:
Yes, 75.

SHAWN:
74 other "Big Kitties" came before you?

GUS:
Yes, Shawn, there were 74 of them.

SHAWN:
All right. All right. Does Kitty have a profile?

GUS:
It's Big Kitty, and, no, I don't.

SHAWN:
Perfect. Scoot over. Give me some room to operate here. (pushes over in front of the computer)

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
(typing) I'm baiting the hook.

GUS:
Baiting the hook? How? You can't do this, Shawn. This is my account.

SHAWN:
(smiles) Sshh. Relax.

GUS:
Don't you tell me to...

SHAWN:
You don't have a profile. They don't know if "Big Kitty" is a man or...

GUS:
I'm a man! The players I play poker with, chat with, know that I'm a man, Shawn!

SHAWN:
That's funny, because it appears Brandon thinks you're a...

GUS:
(reads screen) A cheerleader?

SHAWN:
(types) "Where does a girl go around here for fun and games?"

GUS:
(elbows SHAWN) Stop it, Shawn! Get the...

SHAWN:
Relax!

GUS:
I can't transfer my bank. I have seven million bucks.

SHAWN:
Oh, what's my name? Oh, I don't know.

GUS:
Shawn...

SHAWN:
BigKitty75.

GUS:
Shawn...

SHAWN:
You know, kitty? The kitty... Kitty-cat? Feline! Ah, Felicia.

GUS:
"Felicia Fancybottom"? What am I, a James Bond villain?

SHAWN:
Look, he's inviting us into a private chat.

GUS:
Don't do it, Shawn. I'm telling you, don't do it.

SHAWN:
Buy me a drink? (looks at GUS) I think that question's for you, Felicia. "Where?" Well, I don't know.

GUS:
I can't...

SHAWN:
Dude, where do you go to hook up with dudes you meet online?

GUS:
That's not funny, Shawn.

SHAWN snickers as he types.

GUS:
(reads) Coffee with Attitude coffeehouse. Bring a flower?

SHAWN:
What do you think? Poinsettia?

GUS:
That's a plant, not a flower. And it's out of season.

SHAWN:
(types) Perfect. We'll see just how badly he wants to impress Big Felicia Fancybottom.

GUS pushes SHAWN away and he shrieks.

EXT. COFFFE WITH ATTITUDE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk up to the outside patio. SHAWN stops.

SHAWN:
Ah, he's punctual. (sees BRANDON at a table with a poinsettia) I like that in a date.

SHAWN and GUS walk over to the table and sit down.

BRANDON:
Whoa, guys, I'm expecting somebody, actually.

SHAWN:
We know.

GUS:
Felicia.

BRANDON:
Yeah, how do you know... She's not coming, is she?

SHAWN:
He's Felicia. And I'm Felicia.

BRANDON:
Great. Yeah, I knew it. All hot internet women are guys. Of course, you're two guys, which makes it doubly weird.

GUS:
Sorry, Brandon, but your dad's looking for you.

SHAWN:
That's the rub. He hired us.

BRANDON:
Oh, yeah? Well, the joke's on you, because I'm out of here.

BRANDON gets up and walks away. Unnoticed, a car has pulled up and out steps the MAN from the garden center and his two "muscle men".

SHAWN:
Hey, we just want to talk!

BRANDON sees the men and turns back towards SHAWN and GUS. The two men grab BRANDON.

GUS:
What's going on?

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You know these guys?

MAN:
Hey, relax, Brandon and I are friends. I just want to talk to him for a minute. (puts an arm around BRANDON'S shoulder and pulls him away) So how's it going? You good?

BRANDON:
Yeah.

With that response, the MAN forced BRANDON to bend over and then slammed his knee into the boy's nose.

SHAWN:
Hey!

GUS:
Whoa!

BRANDON stayed bent over, hands on his nose. The MAN leaned over, hands on his knees.

MAN:
Just so you don't forget, you have until Monday.

The MAN straightens up and buttons his jacket before getting back in the car. BRANDON straightens and walks back towards SHAWN and GUS.

BRANDON:
Oh! You were saying?

SHAWN:
Well, it looks like your dad's not the only one who's looking for you, huh?

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stand and listen as BRANDON explains what happened.

BRANDON:
All right, look. You guys have got to give me a break, okay? I stole $30,000 from my dad and then lost it, and more, to that jerk J.P. Berger. So I can't go home, not until I win enough to pay everybody back.

GUS:
What did he say? You've got till Monday?

BRANDON:
Yeah, he did, but, see, the thing is, I'm a better player than he is. I am much better.

SHAWN:
And yet he bent you over his knee and spanked you in front of the whole class.

BRANDON:
But he shouldn't have. I just... I just got to figure out how he did it. (puts ice on his face)

SHAWN meanders over to one of the chairs and leans on one of the armrests and crosses his arms.

GUS:
Look, Brandon, it's simple. You go to your dad and convince him to give you your job back, and then figure out a way to pay Berger back his money.

BRANDON:
That sounds really great, but guys I can't go back to work for my dad. Nothing I do is ever good enough for that man. Nothing is right. You... you have no idea what that's like.

SHAWN:
(gets up and walks over) Look, here's some brutal truth. We're the only reasons you're not in jail or worse. Your dad's done. It took someone cashing in a very old favor to get us involved at all. You will not gonna be able to play your way out of this hole, baby boy! So pack it in! Pull the plug! Shut it down! Leave the dead meat in the freezer and put on your Sunday best, because it's Arbor Day, baby!

BRANDON:
Okay, fair enough. Let's get this over with. (stands) Take me to my father.

INT. ECHO, PETERSON PARKING LOT, DAY

PETERSON is showing a car to a couple. SHAWN, GUS and BRANDON watch from the car.

BRANDON:
What did I tell you? Morning till night. The old man never stops selling.

GUS:
Want some advice?

BRANDON:
Yeah, sure.

GUS:
When you owe a man $30,000, I'd be careful about criticizing his work ethic.

BRANDON:
That's a good point.

SHAWN:
You want us to come with you?

BRANDON:
No. No, you know what? I screwed up on my own, I am going to face him on my own.

SHAWN:
That's very Cameron Fry of you.

BRANDON:
Cameron who?

SHAWN:
Wow, are we that much older than you?

BRANDON kisses a stone he has tied on a rope around his neck.

GUS:
What's that?

BRANDON:
That's nothing. It's a good luck charm. I mean, it used to be... but you know what? (unties it and holds it out to SHAWN)  Here. I don't need it. I've given up cards. I got no use for it.

SHAWN:
Whoa... no, thanks. I'm not really a jewelry guy. Gus here is.

GUS:
No, I'm not.

SHAWN:
Sure you are.

BRANDON:
(takes necklace back) Right. Phew! Let's get this over with, right? (steps out of the car)

GUS:
Trying to pass that thing off to me?

SHAWN:
You liked it. You like the sweet turquoise.

EXT. PETERSON PARKING LOT, DAY

BRANDON watches as GUS and SHAWN pull away. He looks in his father's direction before putting the necklace back on.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

We see LASSITER'S neat desk with pencils aligned meticulously. JULIET is talking with an OFFICER.

JULIET:
So you're telling me that you've been working with him for 15 years, but you have no idea what kind of food he likes?

OFFICER:
He orders separate when we get take-out. Something about poison.

The OFFICER walks away and JULIET sighs. She then notices that LASSITER isn't at his desk. She looks around carefully before walking over. She picks up one of the pencils and uses it to open drawers. She smiles and squats down before pulling out a little black book. She takes a notepad off the desk and begins to copy information. She tears off the paper and puts the pad back and returns the book just as LASSITER comes up behind her.

LASSITER:
What are you doing?

JULIET:
(stands) Looking.

LASSITER:
For what?

JULIET:
A mint.

LASSITER:
I'm allergic to mint.

JULIET:
Ah-ha! (points)

LASSITER:
What?

JULIET:
Nothing. I'm just happy. Now I know you don't like mint. (walks away)

INT. PETERSON MOTORS, SHOWROOM, DAY

A sleep-tousled SHAWN walks inside. He's wearing a white T-shirt and hasn't tucked in his long-sleeved over-shirt. He turns around when he hears HENRY.

HENRY:
Well, well... don't you look like hell.

SHAWN:
I know I look like hell, Dad. Everyone who gets up at this hour looks like hell, with the possible exception of Matt Lauer and Diane Lane. Mr. Peterson. How are you, sir? Something wrong?

HENRY:
No, no, Shawn, everything is great. That's why I woke your ass up, so Bill and I could tell you how... terrific everything is.

PETERSON:
It's Brandon.

SHAWN:
Brandon? He seemed fine when we dropped him off yesterday. Maybe a little nervous.

HENRY:
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You found him?

SHAWN:
Well, yeah, we did.

PETERSON:
When was this?

SHAWN:
Yesterday. (sighs) I'm sorry, sir. I should've told you. It was right before closing. We could clearly see you from Gus' car, and he said he wanted to come in by himself, and do this man-to-man, you know? Just you and him. He didn't come in? You never saw him?

PETERSON:
Oh, we saw him, all right. I got the reunion right here. (holds up security DVD) You want to see it?

INT. PETERSON MOTORS, OFFICE, DAY

The DVD plays on a monitor and shows BRANDON enter the office and head for the safe.

PETERSON:
There he is. There's my boy. Guess he couldn't face me, so he waited till after I went home.

SHAWN:
Not the safe. He's breaking into your safe?

PETERSON:
Breaking in? No, he didn't have to break in. He's too smart for that. He knows the combination!

The camera changes to one inside the safe showing BRANDON clearly taking the money.

PETERSON:
There you have it. Not quite the reunion I imagined. (turns off DVD, stands and kicks safe door) So, tell me, psychic, where's my son now?

SHAWN looks over at HENRY who holds his fingers to his head, telling SHAWN to fake a vision.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is playing the DVD for GUS.

SHAWN:
Something's bothering me, dude. I'm never wrong.

GUS:
You're always wrong. What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
This kid should be a better poker player, Gus. That was a pretty good bluff. Oh, dude, look.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(pauses DVD) Right there, that necklace thing. (zooms in on necklace)

GUS:
That's horrible.

SHAWN:
He wears his ridiculous good luck charm into battle the way that Superman wears his cape or Rocky Balboa wears his belt. I... I bet you he's on his way back to the maze to take on Berger.

GUS:
No, Berger won't be at the lawn and garden center. Not this weekend.

SHAWN:
Why not?

GUS:
There's a tournament. Winner gets a buy-in to the world poker derby.

SHAWN:
You know where that is?

GUS:
Of course I do.

SHAWN:
Phew!

INT. PETERSON MOTORS, OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN enters the office with the DVD case shaking in his hand.

SHAWN:
Oh... It's flipping! Oh, it wants to flip. Oh, it wants to flap! Dad! (grunts and slaps the case against his forehead) T. P. Toilet paper... No. Teri Polo...

GUS:
Shawn...

SHAWN:
T. P. Teepee... teepee with a chimmy. Chimmy, chimmy-changa, chimi-changa. Chaka Khan. Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan. Chimi-changa.

GUS:
Cha-changa?

SHAWN:
Cha-changa! That's it. You say tomato, I say to-mah-to. Cha-changa.

PETERSON:
The Indian casino?

SHAWN:
Cha-ching!

PETERSON:
Dammit. You were right, Henry.

HENRY:
How's that?

PETERSON:
Maybe getting... the police involved is the only way to get his attention. May I have that DVD, please?

SHAWN:
(starts to hand it over then pulls back) No.

PETERSON:
Excuse me?

HENRY:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Not yet.

PETERSON:
Why?

SHAWN:
Let's give him another chance. I'm sensing there's more to this story, sir. He's actually a pretty good poker player.

INT. CASINO, MAIN ROOM, DAY

SHAWN, GUS, HENRY and PETERSON stride into the room looking for BRANDON.

SHAWN:
I'm getting a very, very strong psychic vibration he's going to lose (sees BRANDON with large amount of chips) big!

SHAWN makes to go over to BRANDON but PETERSON holds him back.

PETERSON:
Not with my money, he's not. (strides over to BRANDON and puts a hand on his shoulder) Let's go.

BRANDON:
Oh, God.

PETERSON:
We're out of here.

BRANDON:
No, Dad. Dad, I can't.

PETERSON:
Would you rather I call the police, show them a certain video of you looting my safe?

BRANDON:
I know, I'm sorry about all that.

PETERSON:
No, Brandon, let's go. (pushes him forward)

BRANDON:
(stops and turns) No, Dad, Dad, I'm in more trouble here than you think. I'm already in, and there don't give refunds here.

SHAWN:
(puts a hand on BRANDON'S shoulder) Fine. I'll play.

HENRY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You?

SHAWN:
You know what? Actually, sir, this is your call. I work for you. But keep in mind that I am a psychic, and, unlike any of these other players, I come with a money-back guarantee.

PETERSON:
What do you think, Henry? Can he win?

HENRY:
(remembers SHAWN playing with the cops) Yeah. He can win.

INT. CASINO, POKER ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is seated at one of the tables with other players as GUS, HENRY, PETERSON and BRANDON watch from the sides.

PETERSON:
So, what's the deal?

GUS:
Shawn and Berger drew opposite tables. The only way for him to face Berger is if he beats everyone at his table, makes it to the finals, and wins.

SHAWN casually flips a poker chip through his fingers.

SHAWN:
Check.

SHAWN watches the player to his left as he takes a piece of green gum from a clear bowl on the table. He also sees the man's stained teeth.

SHAWN:
God, must be rough.

PLAYER 1:
Sorry?

SHAWN:
You picked the wrong week to quit smoking, dude. There's a tournament happening here.

PLAYER 1:
What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
What is this about? This is about your lady friend? Your special girl back home? She doesn't like it? Look at the cards, guys, huh? Lot of possibilities on the table right now. Lot of possibilities.

PLAYER 1:
(puts his chips on the table) 50,000.

SHAWN:
(whistles and points to PLAYER 2) Midnight Oil says no! No!

PLAYER 3:
Call.

SHAWN:
Ay-ay-ay. Action. Action in my fanny pack. All right, I'll call you both. (bets and dealer turns over last card) You didn't catch your straight, did you? 100,000. (bets again)

PLAYER 1:
Fold. (tosses in cards)

SHAWN:
You let me down. You let me down. (looks at PLAYER 3) Ronnie!

RONNIE:
What?

SHAWN:
This can be your time. Right here, right now.

RONNIE:
You think you can mess with my head, too?

SHAWN:
Here's the thing. I'm psychic. So if I had to guess, which I don't, I'd say yes. Yes, I can mess with your head, and I can put an entire sandwich in your hair.

RONNIE:
Well, you know what? I'm not playing with a psychic. It's against the rules.

SHAWN:
Against the rules... No, guys, guys, I checked the rule book. I looked in the index under "P". It mentioned polygamy, pancakes, and pterodactyls. Who knew pterodactyls started with a "P"? (looks at PLAYER 4, a woman)I bet you did. You did. It's not against the rules, Ronnie. It's cool.

RONNIE:
No, it's not cool.

SHAWN:
Look at your stack, man. Everything's here. (holds his hands chin level) Everything's here. I need you here. (moves hand to above his head) Take a risk, man. Bluff it up.

RONNIE:
I'll raise you 200,000. (slides his chips onto the table)

SHAWN:
You just bluffed to prove to me that you could bluff. Ronnie... I call this move the all-in. (slides all his chips onto the table)

RONNIE throws in his cards.

SHAWN:
Ronnie, with the origami.

SHAWN rakes in the kitty with a laugh. Play continues until only SHAWN and BERGER remain.

ANNOUNCER:
Center table showdown, Shawn Spencer and J.P. Berger.

They sit at opposite ends of the table. The DEALER fans the cards. She straightens her ponytail before touching the backs of some of them, as if counting. She then picks them up and deals.

BERGER:
(pushes all his chips onto the table) All in.

DEALER:
All in? All in?

BERGER takes off his tinted glasses to clean them, inadvertently holding them over his cards. SHAWN sees a marking on the backs through the glasses that aren't visible without them. He also notices that the DEALER is wearing the bracelet he saw at the garden center. He remembers what BRANDON said about how he shouldn't have won. He also recalls what the dealer did with the cards.

SHAWN:
Wait! Wait, wait, wait. (leans over like he's listening to the chips) The chips demand we stop the game.

BERGER:
What the hell is going on here?

SHAWN:
(holds a chip up to each ear) I can't hear them if you're talking, Berger. What? Really? You guys sure about this? Chips say you're a cheater, cheater, pumpkin-eater.

BERGER:
Is that right?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

BERGER:
How do you know that? We're really supposed to believe that you're psychic or something! If you were psychic, I wouldn't be cleaning your clock right now.

SHAWN:
Cleaning my clock? What does that mean, Berger? What, you'd take time out of your day to clean another man's timepiece? And if so, that would be a bad thing? No, I would be gracious. I would say, "J.P, dude... thanks for spritzing my watch." Besides, it doesn't matter. Doesn't take a psychic to figure out that these cards are marked.

BERGER:
You know, if you had been paying attention, you'd realize that the decks were all sealed.

SHAWN:
Shh! He's saying the decks are sealed. What do you got for me? Well, come on, guys, speed it up. Check the... Oh! For shame! You dirty filthy rascal with the suede-suede head. (goes over to BERGER and picks up the glasses) Ah-ha! (looks through them) Face card, face card. (turns over cards)

SECURITY:
Well, how's that possible? These are brand-new decks. We got spotters on every table.

SHAWN:
But you didn't check your dealers. Okay, I'm on the dealer. What do you got for me? Hair clip! Hair clip, of course. You! You, stand up. (pulls the DEALER up) I'm sorry.

BERGER:
(stands) Hold on! This...(rubs eyes)

SHAWN:
(looks through glasses) Oh my, there's some kind of invisible ink on this hair clip, and every time she fussed with her ponytail and I think we can all agree it's a fetching tail, it's a silky tail, she got the ink on her fingers, and then she put her fingers on the cards! (fans cards) And then her special partner with his special rose-colored glasses could see that everything is turning up faces. (turns over cards)

SECURITY:
All right, put a hold on all of these chips here. Take these two into custody until we sort this out.

BERGER and the DEALER are taken out.

BERGER:
This is ridic... You're ridiculous!

SHAWN:
For shame!

BRANDON laughs and shakes hands with PETERSON.

>>>LATER>>>

The winnings are put on the table in front of SHAWN, GUS, HENRY, PETERSON and BRANDON.

SHAWN:
That is... so much money. I'll, uh... I'll let you guys... make it right. (stands off to the side with GUS)

BRANDON:
Well, now I know why I always lost to Berger. It wasn't me. But, um... it was me... stealing from you, lying to you, and... Dad, for that, I really am sorry.

PETERSON:
Well, I appreciate the apology, son, but you gonna have to do a lot more than that to earn my trust back. Thank you. (hands SHAWN a strap of money)

SHAWN:
No, thank, thank you, Mr. Peterson.

PETERSON:
No, thank you...

SHAWN:
No, seriously, thank you.

GUS:
Thank you.

PETERSON:
Shut up.

INT. CASINO, MAIN ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS exit the poker room with SHAWN thumbing the cash.

SHAWN:
Dude, $7,500? Peterson is a generous man. This is our most profitable case ever.

GUS:
I know, I got plans. Pay off the flat screen, consolidate our loans, and pay off the bulk in a lump sum!

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

GUS:
Ooh!

SHAWN:
Or... (walks over to roulette wheel)

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
We double up, right here, right now.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Come on, Gus. Think about it. Seriously, 15 large?

GUS:
What are you talking about, Shawn?

SHAWN:
We could go to Aruba...

GUS:
Shawn...

SHAWN:
Cozumel.

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Ibeeza.

GUS:
It's "Ibitha".

SHAWN:
Dude, we could rent a jet to Ibitha.

GUS:
Don't even think about it.

SHAWN:
Rule number one of gambling, do not think.

GUS:
That's not a rule, Shawn!

SHAWN:
Rule number two, always bet on black. (holds the money out in front of him and pulls it out of GUS' grab) Money plays.

GUS:
Whoa, but...

SHAWN:
Isn't that right, Steve? (tosses cash on table)

GUS:
I can't believe you did that!

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF LASSITER'S HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk down the street and look as two motorcyclists pass them.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Look, I told you, that's why I don't gamble.

GUS:
Shut up, Shawn.

SHAWN:
What did Wesley say in Passenger 57?

GUS:
I don't want to talk about it.

SHAWN:
He said, "Always bet on black" So I did!

JULIET and VICK are standing on LASSITER'S front lawn. JULIET hands out cold beers while VICK looks at the guests.

JULIET:
Yeah... here you go. They're cold. (to VICK) Um, Lassiter leads a really different private life.

VICK:
Yeah...

JULIET:
I mean, who would've thought he's into bikes. I guess... Hi.

A large number of the guests are bikers in leather and jeans.

VICK:
Some of these people look really familiar.

JULIET:
Yeah! I know, to me, too! But I haven't had a chance to talk to any of them yet.

GUS:
I see his car. I see his car.

JULIET:
What? Oh, everybody, hide! Hide!

Everyone hides behind cars or around the side of the house. JULIET and VICK hide on the porch. LASSITER parks and gets out of his car. He looks around at all the motorcycles and strange cars.

LASSITER:
What the hell?

He closes the car door and walks into the yard, still looking around. JULIET and VICK are the first to pop out and yell "Surprise!" LASSITER pulls his gun and everyone ducks for cover.

JULIET:
Whoa! Whoa! No, it's okay. Oh, my gosh, no, no, no, no! (approaches LASSITER) Carlton. Hey, it's a party. It's a party.

LASSITER:
It's what?

JULIET:
For your birthday. Surprise!

The guests move closer, SHAWN clapping.

LASSITER:
Why are these people at my house?

JULIET:
They're your friends.

LASSITER:
No, they're not.

JULIET:
Yeah, they are. I got them out of your address book.

LASSITER:
You took my book?

JULIET:
Yes, I admit it. I opened your desk. I didn't want to load you up with a bunch of work people, so I just invited the ones with stars by their names.

LASSITER:
These are all people I put in jail. The stars are repeat offenders.

SHAWN and GUS look at each other.

VICK:
You keep a little black book of people you've arrested?

LASSITER:
Of course I do.

SHAWN:
Why?

LASSITER:
To drive by and check on them.

A large transvestite holds up a brightly-wrapped present. LASSITER holsters his gun as he walks back to his house. JULIET goes after him.

JULIET:
Um, Carlton, where are you going?

LASSITER:
To pack.

JULIET:
Why?

LASSITER:
(stops on porch and turns) Because now they know where I live.

SHAWN:
(raises arm) Happy birthday, dude!

GUS:
Happy birthday.

SHAWN and GUS start backing away slowly and break into a run when they reach the street.

Episode 1x15 Scary Sherry

Look! I've done it! I've finished season 1! I hope you all liked it and I will continue so keep watching.


HALLOWEEN NIGHT, 1987

EXT. STREET, NIGHT

SHAWN is dressed as a policeman and is none too happy about it. He leaves the house and stops, looking up.

SHAWN:
This is torture.

HENRY, in uniform, is leaning against his squad car.

HENRY:
It's not torture, Shawn. It's a 10-minute ride to the police station.

SHAWN:
(whines) But I want to eat my candy! (holds up plastic bag)

HENRY:
Not until I have it X-rayed.

GUS joins them dressed as Lando Calrissian.

GUS:
Well, can I eat my candy?

HENRY:
Knock yourself out, Lando. As long as your old man doesn't mind his nine-year-old son passing razor blades.

INT. SQUAD CAR, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS sit in the front seat as HENRY drives them to the station. Out of nowhere, a MAN throws himself at the car, forcing HENRY to step on the brakes. The MAN peers in the open window.

MAN:
Help! Officer, please! We've got a jumper!

HENRY:
(points) Hey, hey, back off. I got kids in here.

MAN:
Phone lines are down. We've tried the police already. There's no time, she's really going to jump.

HENRY:
Okay, okay, look, look, I'll radio for backup, but I'm not going to subject these boys to--

SHAWN and GUS look at the building and see the woman.

SHAWN:
Dad, you have to help.

HENRY looks and sees the woman standing in the open window.

HENRY:
Son of a--

HENRY puts on the lights and siren and drives onto the premises past a sign reading "Wispy Sunny Pines Mental Health Facility". He pulls up in front of the building.

HENRY:
All right, now, listen to me, boys. I do not want you to leave this vehicle. Do you understand? I want you to stay put until I get back. Don't look. Don't listen. Just shut your eyes. (gets out of the car) And keep them shut. I'll be right back.

SHAWN and GUS close their eyes.

EXT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, NIGHT

HENRY rushes up the stairs followed by the MAN.

MAN:
She's straight up the stairs. Room 413!

INT. SQUAD CAR, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are sitting with their eyes shut tight.

SHAWN:
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

GUS:
Not even sort of.

SHAWN opens his eyes and looks up at the building where he sees the woman framed in the window. GUS peeks and sees SHAWN looking. The woman leans forward and starts to fall. GUS puts his hand over SHAWN'S eyes while closing his own. SHAWN reaches up with his hand to pulls GUS' away.

SHAWN:
Gus...

GUS:
You'll thank me later.

SHAWN finally gets GUS' hand away and looks up at the window. It's empty. The boys look at each other as more police arrive on site.

EXACTLY TWENTY YEARS LATER...give or take ten minutes

EXT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, NIGHT

The facility is long-abandoned; overgrown and dilapidated.

INT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, NIGHT

A scared young woman is walking down the hall as a scary voice calls out her name. She looks around and sees a figure in white coming at her. She runs up the stairs as the voice keeps calling.

VOICE:
Doreen!

DOREEN runs down the hall, scrambling under a fallen door. She presses back against a wall and whimpers.

VOICE:
Doreen!

DOREEN runs into the closest room: 413. She looks out the window and sees the reflection of the figure chasing her. She turns and screams as she backs away. She falls backwards out the window. A figure dressed in white with black hair looks out the window.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the office, still dressed from playing racquetball.

GUS:
You cheated.

SHAWN:
I did not cheat. You're not using the side walls at all.

GUS:
I don't need your tips, Shawn. I've beaten you before.

SHAWN:
Yeah, when we were 12, and I had pink eye.

GUS:
Immaterial. The low game was crackling. The worm burner was in full effect.

SHAWN:
You cannot have a shot called the worm burner.

GUS:
Why not?

SHAWN:
Because it's my strikeout pitch in wiffle ball. Pick a different name.

They turn around and see a woman dressed in a pink shirt and a denim mini-skirt facing away from them.

SHAWN:
Excuse us. May we help you?

The woman turns around and it's JULIET.

JULIET:
(turns around) Hey, guys.

GUS:
Damn, girl.

JULIET:
Yeah, I know. Get it all out now. I barely recognize myself.(takes two cards from her purse) But isn't it kind of amazing?

JULIET walks over and hands SHAWN and GUS a card each.

SHAWN:
(reads) Mary Lou Baumgartner, National Alumni Vice-Parliamentarian, Beta Kappa Theta sorority. (looks at GUS)

JULIET:
Guys, I'm undercover. Deep.

SHAWN:
Oh...we should totally celebrate!

JULIET:
It's crazy. I have spent the entire morning planning a mixer! And yesterday, I went and I had a Himalayan mani-pedi. Yeah, at first, it was just to get the other girls to talk, but then I realized my cuticles have been completely taken for granted.

SHAWN:
Jules?

JULIET:
Hmm?

SHAWN:
You realize that we're the only ones that can see or hear you?

JULIET:
Yeah, okay, I admit, I've been undercover a week now, and it's really hard to get out of this mindset. These girls, they are demons. They are vicious little prairie dogs with trust funds and collagen parties. It's a lot to juggle, and I need a favor.

SHAWN:
Okay.

JULIET:
I've been at the university investigating the death of a co-ed, Doreen Harthan.

GUS:
The girl they found at Wispy Sunny Pines? Isn't that a suicide?

JULIET:
Allegedly. A copycat job. I guess Santa Barbara has some sort of urban legend about a mental patient who jumped from room 413.

GUS:
Scary Sherry.

SHAWN:
We know that one.

JULIET:
Yeah, well, I'm not so sure about the suicide angle, and Interim Chief Vick is putting a tremendous amount of faith in me to crack this thing, and I need to build a case. (unzips a pink folder and pulls out a file) So I'm here, but I'm not. Get it?

SHAWN:
(takes file) Gus, what's the word?

GUS:
Uh, that would be "mum".

JULIET:
Doreen was pledging the sorority, and I, or Mary Lou, am helping my sisters through this very difficult time. I'm convinced they know more than they're letting on. I need a psychic to read the sorority house. Can you come by tonight?

SHAWN:
Can we wear pajamas?

JULIET:
No.

SHAWN:
Even better.

JULIET:
Guys, this is serious. There's some really weird stuff that's been going on. These girls are petrified. They think they're being haunted.

GUS:
By what?

JULIET hesitates and looks down.

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, Jules. You know we're going to come man up. Just tell us.

JULIET:
Doreen Harthan's lumbering ghost.

GUS:
Lumbering?

SHAWN:
Seems completely logical to me.

JULIET:
(picks up purse) Meet me at the house at 7:00. And remember, I was never here.

SHAWN:
Oh, quick question. Where's Lassiter for all of this?

JULIET:
Temporary reassignment. Bye! (waves and leaves)

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

LASSITER stops short when he sees an older woman sitting at the table in the room.

LASSITER:
Excuse me. I'm going to have to ask you to vacate this room.

The WOMAN is eating a muffin with a cup of coffee.

WOMAN:
Excuse me. I'm going to have to ask you to go screw yourself.

LASSITER:
I beg your pardon?

WOMAN:
Oh, don't beg.

LASSITER:
(walks over) Look, there's going to be a private meeting in this room between myself and a new detective from a new department.

WOMAN:
Well, then I must be in the right place.

LASSITER:
Uh, no, ma'am, I'm looking for a rookie.

WOMAN:
What the hell does that mean?

LASSITER:
You know, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, roots matching the rest of the hair.

WOMAN:
I'm a detective. Goochberg. "Gooch" to people I respect, and those few lucky enough to have seen me naked. Guess which one you should use?

LASSITER:
Oh, God, the first one? How could you possibly be a rookie detective at your... you know, advanced age?

GOOCHBERG:
I passed the test Friday. I had to sue the department to let me take it again.

LASSITER:
Again?

GOOCHBERG:
I might have failed it...a few times. 13, to be exact. But that's the first thing you're going to learn about me, scarecrow. The word "quit" is not in my vocabulary. Where do you go to shoot guns around here?

GOOCHBERG stands and heads for the door leaving a stunned LASSITER standing in the empty room.

INT. SORORITY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are sitting on couches across from each other surrounded by the residents drinking tea. SHAWN takes a deep breath and looks covertly into the purse of the girl next to him. He sees a valet parking ticket for the mall and has a "vision".

SHAWN:
I see a man. He's driving your car. You don't know him. He's a valet. And a mall. Wait, I see a shoe store. Your father's gold card. A Jamba Juice may have been involved.

GIRL:
Oh, my God, I totally went shopping today. And I passed a Jamba on State Street. You are amazing.

All the girls gasp in amazement.

JULIET:
See, Bianca? (whispers) Now, tell Shawn what happened to you last night.

BIANCA:
Okay, here goes. This is so scary. I was lying in bed watching One Tree Hill, my favorite show-- Chad Michael Murray is so hot. And I have this cute liquid kitty alarm clock, right? It meows, and it blinks its eyes every half-hour. So, all of a sudden, they just started blinking, over and over and over, and then it just stopped! And then... it let out this half-meow (meows) And then its tail fell off. Then it exploded.

SHAWN:
Wow. Uh, slow build. Uh, half-meow? Unexpected. Didn't see the end coming at all. How about you, Gus?

GUS:
Uh, what? No, I can't say I did.

SHAWN:
Anybody else?

The girls all start talking at once.

JULIET:
Okay, okay, so basically, it's a lot of really weird stuff that's creepy and happens at night. Mr... Spencer, is it?

SHAWN:
Yes, that's correct, Mrs... barn...door? Take...bill... mat... snatcher...bik... gert... sten...per plintken? Baumgartner. Now, what I'm going to need from you, is an article of clothing, preferably an undergarment.

JULIET:
Don't you usually get that from the victim?

SHAWN:
I've seen it both ways. I'm going to have to take a look around to see... what I feel. Starting with the bedrooms. (stands)

JULIET:
Of course. I'll show you upstairs.

The girls sitting next to GUS look at each other.

GIRL 1:
Ask him.

GIRL 2:
You ask him.

GUS:
What? What do you want to ask me, girls? Don't be nervous. I put on my pants one leg at time, just like you. (laughs)

SHAWN hears what's going on and puts a hand up to stop JULIET as he waits to hear the outcome.

GIRL 1:
Okay. Did you really play Bud on The Cosby Show?

GUS:
(offended) Bud? Who told you that?

SHAWN smirks.

BIANCA:
I knew I recognized you!

GUS looks over as SHAWN moves JULIET across the room.

GUS:
Wait, wait, I'm not--

BIANCA:
Oh, come on, don't be modest, Gus. You were totally Bud!

GUS:
Shawn, you believe this?

SHAWN:
Uh, no, no, no, I-I didn't...I didn't catch any of that... Bud.

GUS:
Stop telling people that my name is Bud! (stands)

The room goes dark and the girls gasp. A voice echoes through the room.

VOICE:
Get out!

The lights come back on for a moment before going out again.

VOICE:
Ackenaib! Ackenaib! Ackenaib!

A vase falls from the mantelpiece and shatters on the floor. The girls gasp as a floor lamp falls over. The lights come back on again and GUS looks at SHAWN and points to the right. The lights go off again and they all look at each other. BIANCA screams and everyone looks in the same direction and we see a figure in white, face distorted by the window. The girls scream and run to huddle in the center of the room. The lights come back on and, sitting on the cushion where GUS had been seated in is teacup resting on its saucer. JULIET sees that SHAWN is no longer standing next to her.

EXT. SORORITY HOUSE, NIGHT

GUS and SHAWN down the stairs to the car screaming girlishly.

GUS:
Get in the car! We're going to die!

GUS runs to the driver's side and hits the alarm button on his keys. On the passenger side, SHAWN jumps up and down.

SHAWN:
Make it open! Make the door open!

GUS:
I'm trying!

SHAWN:
Make the door open!

JULIET:
(on the stairs) Shawn! Where are you going?

SHAWN stops jumping and composes himself before walking over to JULIET. GUS finally gets the alarm to stop. He also realizes his window was down.

SHAWN:
My partner and I just need to confer in private. Compare notes and whatnot.

The car engine starts and SHAWN turns around to see GUS peel out of the driveway. He looks at JULIET as if to say "Let's pretend this never happened".

INT. SORORITY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN is checking out the empty room as JULIET enters.

JULIET:
Okay... the girls are sleeping over at the Omega Mus'.

SHAWN sits on the couch and JULIET sits next to him. He holds up a piece of electronics.

SHAWN:
Well, they can come home tomorrow. I found the evil spirit. It's Radio Shack. The face at the window? The old "floodlight on the roof" trick. That's how they do it at Haunted Mansion. Don't ask me how I know that.

JULIET:
These girls are awful. The suspect list is essentially the entire student registry. Although...

SHAWN:
Although what?

JULIET:
Alice Bundy. Doreen's best friend, her roommate.

SHAWN:
I thought you said she lived at home.

JULIET:
The Harthans took Alice in. She's the only one that I haven't talked to, but conventional wisdom would say she has a score to settle. Holy Shitzu! (looks at her hand)

SHAWN:
Excuse me?

JULIET:
(whines) This nail polish is already starting to chip.

SHAWN just shakes his head.

INT. SBPD, FIRING RANGE, DAY

LASSITER has on his protective gear while GOOCHBERG, in the area next to him, is not using any. She blinks every time she fires while LASSITER shows complete control. When they are done, LASSITER enters her area.

LASSITER:
You know, you might actually hit the target more if you bothered to blink in between rounds, and of course your concentration level might get a little boost if you bothered to wear protective ear and eyewear.

GOOCHBERG:
Nah. That wouldn't do any good. I'm totally deaf in this ear. (points to left) I was in a barroom fight with a teamster. She had a waffle iron. But see, that's not the problem. The problem is this pea-shooter, this pea-shooter they issued me (puts down gun) I need a real gun. I need something like this. (picks up LASSITER'S)

LASSITER:
No!

GOOCHBERG:
Let me see this. Ah, see, now, this is a gun. (cocks and aims the gun at the target)

LASSITER:
No, you see, that's an enormously powerful handgun. You're not bracing yourself for the kickback.

GOOCHBERG:
(looks at LASSITER) Don't tell me my business, kid.

GOOCHBERG uses both hands to aim and LASSITER covers his ears. GOOCHBERG fires and the gun goes flying out of her hands and falls to the floor, falling apart. LASSITER whimpers.

EXT. COLLEGE QUAD, DAY

A number of campus organizations have booths set up to promote awareness for various charities. The sorority is organizing makeovers. JULIET is there with BIANCA, BETTY and EDEN. A girl walks by the booth showing some curiosity.

JULIET:
Oh, trust me, you won't even recognize yourself.

BETTY:
Which is a really good thing.

JULIET:
It'll be fun, and you can help save the endangered Tamarind monkeys.

The girl takes a flyer and walks away. JULIET looks around and sees a young woman with long dark hair dressed in jeans and a casual top take the stairs to the quad. She leaves the booth.

BETTY:
Bianca, you have, like, twice as many flyers as me and Mary Lou. What's going on with you? Are you... are you, like, pregnant or something?

BIANCA:
Can you just shut up for, like, five seconds, Betty?

BETTY:
Oh, my God. You are being such a horrid little bitch right now.

BIANCA:
How can you just... aren't you scared? I haven't slept at all. I feel like I'm losing--

BETTY:
Suck it up. End of story. I will not go down with you, Bianca.

BIANCA shoves her flyers at BETTY and walks away. In another section of the quad, JULIET approaches the girl.

JULIET:
Alice Bundy? Hi! I'm Mary Lou Baumgartner. Beta Kappa Theta West Coast Alumni...

ALICE:
Yeah, save it. I already hate you.

JULIET:
...Vice Parliamentarian. Oh. Well. I know you were Doreen's best friend, and I just wanted to introduce myself and let you know that if there's anything that I or Beta Kappa Theta can do for you during this very difficult time, please, don't hesitate to ask. (hands ALICE a flyer)

ALICE:
How does it feel being Queen of the Damned?

JULIET:
Alice, I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

ALICE:
Well, just stay away from me. Fair warning.

ALICE walks away and into the Engineering building. BETTY walks up to JULIET, watching ALICE.

BETTY:
Ew, hair.

JULIET:
(scoffs) Yeah.

EXT. SBPD, PARKING LOT, DAY

LASSITER and GOOCHBERG are walking to his car. He opens the passenger door for GOOCHBERG but she opens the rear passenger door.

LASSITER:
What are you doing?

GOOCHBERG:
I'm riding in the back.

LASSITER:
No, you're not.

GOOCHBERG:
I'm not going to take a stray bullet for you, scarecrow. Look, even if I wanted to sit in the front, it's not going to happen. My eyes can't take that kind of direct sunlight. My rods and cones are all out of whack. I took a crowbar to an eye socket during a sangria party gone wrong. Long story short, I've got early onset retinitis pigmentosa. (chews on a toothpick and gets into the back seat)

Showing great restraint, LASSITER closes the passenger door.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, NIGHT

GUS is working at his desk when SHAWN walks over to him and sets motorcycle helmet on the corner of the desk.

SHAWN:
Hey, buddy, good news. I just got a fax confirming that the city of has unanimously voted you Santa Barbara Exorcist of the Year. (claps)

GUS:
Okay, make all your little jokes. But I know who was right on my ass all the way to the car.

SHAWN:
I had no choice. You were my ride home.

GUS:
Shawn, you were screaming, too.

SHAWN:
Yes, I was screaming, "Gus, stop! Let's be brave!"

GUS:
Look, both the parents and the best friend were adamant that Doreen had too much to live for to kill herself. Plus, she was pledging a sorority.

SHAWN:
(walks over to the board with information on it) Right.

GUS:
(shows SHAWN photos) Now, take another look at this.

SHAWN:
(studies photo) The latch is broken.

GUS:
And she fell backwards.

SHAWN:
Scary Sherry took a swan dive.

GUS:
Exactly.

SHAWN:
Gus, you're on fire.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
The copycat suicide angle literally goes out the window. What next?

GUS:
I couldn't find the word "ackenaib" anywhere. I checked alternate spellings, all possible roots. Nothing in Latin. So now I'm going through the dead languages by region. Sanskrit was a wash, as was Avestan. Up next is Old Church Slavonic, but to be honest, I think it's all just nonsensical gibberish.

SHAWN goes back to the board and writes "ACNAIB" in marker under other variations of the word.

GUS:
But it's gotta mean something. The voice at the house kept repeating it.

SHAWN:
(imitates the voice as he writes) Acnaib. (mimics with his finger) Acnaib. Acnaib. I don't know. (sees reflection in helmet) What's Juliet's number? I have a theory. (reaches for phone)

GUS:
What's the theory?

SHAWN:
Gus, just feed me the digits.

GUS:
Why do I always have to ask what the damn theory is, Shawn?

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, NIGHT

JULIET, still dressed as Mary Lou, is working at her desk. She checks her watch and prepares to leave just as her cell phone rings. She gets the phone from her purse and answers as Mary Lou.

JULIET:
Hello?

SHAWN:
(over phone) Is Bianca with you?

JULIET:
Who wants to know?

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN:
Jules! Where is she?

JULIET:
Okay, tone. (continues to collect her items) She's back at the house with Betty, running late for the mixer, just like me.

SHAWN:
All right, listen, I've had a vision. We need to meet at the sorority house on the fly.

JULIET:
Shawn, I can't! (checks gun) I have to make the spirit speech, and who's going to fuse the Planter's Punch? Oh, yeah, and by the way, met Alice Bundy today. Not a shiny happy person. I think maybe--

SHAWN:
Jules! Doreen didn't kill herself! She was not alone in that room, and we need to talk to Bianca right now! (tosses the keys to GUS) She's in danger!

EXT. SORORITY HOUSE, NIGHT

A gloved hand attached to a plaid-covered arm plugs in an exterior extension cord to an outside plug.

INT. SORORITY HOUSE, BATHROOM, NIGHT

BIANCA sits in an old tub, bubble bath up to her neck. She is on the verge of tears. There is a knock on the door.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. SORORITY HOUSE, HALL, NIGHT

BETTY:
Bianca! What are you doing in there? We're going to be totally late for Mary Lou's speech, and we're supposed to lead the slow clap.

BIANCA:
Just go without me. You don't have to wait.

The transom window high on the wall above the bath opens.

BETTY:
Okay, this is ridiculous. Just open the door. I'm coming in there.

BIANCA:
I'm not going to the mixer, Betty. Even if I wanted to, (looks at hands) my fingers and toes are all pruney now.

A toaster is lowered through the window.

BETTY:
Ew.

EXT. SORORITY HOUSE, NIGHT

JULIET pulls up to the house in her Volkswagon and heads inside.

INT. SORORITY HOUSE, HALL, NIGHT

BETTY:
Bianca, open the door. This is completely ridiculous.

INT. SORORITY HOUSE, BATHROOM, NIGHT

BIANCA sees the toaster and screams. The toaster drops into the water and the electricity crackles.

INT. SORORITY HOUSE, ENTRANCE HALL, NIGHT

JULIET pauses as the lights flicker.

INT. SORORITY HOUSE, HALL, NIGHT

BETTY is pulling on the knob of the bathroom door. JULIET calls up.

JULIET:
Hello?

BETTY:
(frantic) Mary Lou, it's Bianca! Help!

JULIET runs up the stairs, and, after trying the doorknob, bursts it open with her shoulder. Both she and BETTY rush in only to look in shock. SHAWN and GUS run into the house and up the stairs, stopping on the landing when they see JULIET. SHAWN looks at her.

SHAWN:
Jules?

JULIET just shakes her head.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, NIGHT

JULIET, as Mary Lou, is there with BETTY, trying to get her to talk as VICK looks on. SHAWN and GUS watch from the sidelines.

JULIET:
Betty, if you know something, you have to tell the Chief here. We are all in danger. Any one of us could be next.

VICK:
I can sit here all night, Betty. I've got a six-month-old who still has colic. I consider this a reprieve. Now, why is your friend Bianca dead?

SHAWN:
(puts a hand to his head) I can see it. I can see her running down the hallway of the asylum. Wait a second. Doreen wasn't supposed to die. This was an accident. (sits at table) The wood. The wood was rotten. The latch broke.

BETTY:
Yes, yes, it broke! That's it. Don't you see? We never meant for her to fall! It was a complete accident!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FLASHBACK to the night of DOREEN'S death. BIANCA was the one dressed up as Scary Sherry. BETTY comes up beside her.

BETTY:
Oh, my God, Bianca! What the hell did you do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VICK:
Okay, please, do continue.

BETTY:
Okay, like, it was, it was my job to get Doreen into the house. She knew that it was a haze. She thought that she was supposed to spend the whole night inside. Like that movie with the hedge maze and Vincent van Patten?

JULIET:
Hell Night.

BETTY:
Exactly. Bianca was inside, wearing this nightgown, you know, like. like Scary Sherry, the girl who jumped from--

GUS:
We know.

SHAWN:
Nightgown. Nightgown. I'm feeling the nightgown.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FLASHBACK-

EXT. TAR PIT, NIGHT

BETTY and BIANCA walk up to a pit. BIANCA is holding the white nightgown.

BETTY:
Put it in. (takes gown from BIANCA) God. (throws gown into the pit and pushes it down with a stick)

BETTY: (v.o.)
Bianca buried it in the tar pits three nights ago.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JULIET:
Tar pits?

BETTY:
I know, it was really gross and sticky, (voice breaks) but she was just scared. We both were. Look, it was an accident, I swear to God. Bianca tried to grab her arm, but it was too late. I mean, nobody was supposed to die! (takes tissue from JULIET) Now Bianca's gone, too.

VICK:
You withheld evidence, and by conspiring with Bianca, we can charge you with involuntary manslaughter. You understand that's a crime?

BETTY:
Oh, God, no! No!

EXT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, NIGHT

Scary Sherry stands in the open window. Young SHAWN pulls GUS' hand away from his eyes and looks up just as the woman leans forward.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN wakes with a gasp, his head on his laptop keyboard. He sits up slowly with a groan and rubs the back of his neck. GUS is standing beside his desk, a cup of coffee in his hand.

GUS:
You actually slept here last night?

SHAWN:
Yes, I did. It's called crunch time. Did you check the messages? Have we heard from Juliet?

GUS:
Yeah. Alice Bundy's alibi's air tight. She lives with Doreen's family. Says she went upstairs to bed early that night, and the parents confirmed it. They were still downstairs awake when the police called.

SHAWN gets up and walks to the fridge.

SHAWN:
Who the hell is doing this?

GUS:
Oh, and your dad called.

SHAWN:
What could he possibly want? (takes out small bottle of juice)

GUS:
Said he wanted to remind you about dinner tonight. You're supposed to bring dessert. He actually seemed sort of excited.

SHAWN:
Oh, God, that's tonight. Dude, you have to come.

GUS:
(picks up sample case) Ooh, I don't know about that, Shawn. Seems like a pretty big deal, him reaching out and all. I wouldn't want to intrude.

SHAWN:
(sips juice) Gus, he loves you. He always has. Plus, if you come, we can roll earlier. We'll say we're working on a case.

GUS:
We are working on a case. (goes through case)

SHAWN:
Sweet. So it's settled. What are you doing?

GUS:
I have to start and ultimately finish my route.

SHAWN:
Awesome. (caps juice and picks up keys) I am going to go find Alice "Best Friend" Bundy.

GUS:
Don't you think that girl has been through enough, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Gus, there is no such thing as an airtight alibi, and if there is, we're going to pretend like there isn't. This girl is Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct, which makes me Michael Douglas, and you George Dzundza. Whose name is actually Gus in the film! Until we have another lead, we assume it's her. We've just got to figure out the "how." So far, no ice pick.

GUS:
(closes case and walks over to SHAWN) Okay, first of all, don't ever compare my black ass to George Dzundza again, okay?

SHAWN:
Fair.

GUS:
And what could you possibly ask that girl that the police already haven't?

EXT. COLLEGE QUAD, DAY

SHAWN finds ALICE in front of the engineering building.

SHAWN:
Want to split a pineapple? (holds up the fruit)

ALICE:
I'm sorry, do I know you?

SHAWN:
My name is Ichabod Fletchman. "Sticky Icky" to my boys, but that's neither here nor there. What's important is that this baby is 82% Hawaiian, and I've got all afternoon.

ALICE:
Are you a crazy person?

SHAWN:
(sees two friendship rings on her finger) It's funny, I was about to ask you the same thing, only I was going to add "who likes to make toast" to the end of mine.

ALICE:
Great. So you're another cop, then?

SHAWN:
Not a cop. Not even close.

ALICE:
Well, then who are you?

SHAWN looks around and sees a biker with spiked, tipped hair whose bike chain is off track.

SHAWN:
Hint. Green Day there is about to eat some stone.

The guy gets on his bike and pedals for a bit before the bike stops and he falls off.

ALICE:
How did you do that?

SHAWN:
I'm a psychic.

ALICE:
Pass. (walks away)

SHAWN runs around and cuts her off.

SHAWN:
Oh, come on. I was trying to be cool.

ALICE:
What do you want from me? You want to read my palm? Would you like a lock of my hair?

SHAWN:
Whoa, Alice. Now, I can. I can feel that you're hurting--

ALICE:
Really? Can you feel that I'm hurting? Come on, psychic, you can do better than that, can't you? Do you have a best friend?

SHAWN is a little taken aback. This encounter is not going as planned.

SHAWN:
Yeah. Uh, since birth, almost.

ALICE:
Great, so then maybe you could wrap your head around this. Doreen and I were closer than sisters. Her parents took me in when I was seven. Seven. They raised me. We did everything together, and the one time that I wasn't there, the one time I let her down, and now she's gone.

SHAWN:
I know if anything happened to Gus, I would, uh... I don't know, I've never... I mean, I was...

ALICE:
Look, do you really think I killed that girl? Do you? I mean, I understand your suspicion and everything, but I'm barely hanging on here, and I just don't think that. I'm not a murderer.

SHAWN:
Well, I certainly hope not for your sake.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE, DAY

LASSITER and GOOCHBERG are talking with the store CLERK.

CLERK:
Someone came in and emptied the cash register when I was in the back.

LASSITER:
(looks at GOOCHBERG) You're not writing this down?

GOOCHBERG:
Who's got the arthritic thumb here? I hitchhiked from Jersey to Havana when I was 19.

LASSITER:
For crying out loud. (takes pad and pen from jacket pocket)

CLERK:
They also got away with about $60 worth of rump roast.

GOOCHBERG:
Don't try to sell me on that nonsense, you punk! What, do you think this is my first square dance? (lunges and slides of the counter before gripping the clerk by her shirt) Give me your gun, Lassiter. I'll show you how to make this little pig squeal.

The CLERK breaks away and runs out the door.

GOOCHBERG:
You're just going to let him go?

LASSITER:
He's the victim, Goochberg!

GOOCHBERG:
Fine! Fine! I'll do it myself! (runs after the clerk)

EXT. SORORITY HOUSE, DAY

JULIET is heading for her car when one of the girls, EDEN, comes out of the door.

EDEN:
Mary Lou, wait! I totally almost forgot to give this to you. (hands JULIET an oversized envelope)

JULIET:
Well, what is it, Eden?

EDEN:
I don't know. It was left on the stoop, like, like a little baby orphan.

JULIET opens the envelope and sees an invitation for a candlelight vigil.

JULIET:
(reads) "God's gift is forgiveness. Please join us in remembering our daughter. Your attendance would be greatly appreciated."

EDEN:
Tonight? Hello! Plans. Bye! (heads back inside)

JULIET:
Bye! (gets in car)

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

There are a number of dirty plates on the table, a sign of a good dinner. The three are on dessert. HENRY sits at the head of the table drinking a bottle of beer. SHAWN and GUS are on either side. SHAWN is pushing food around on his plate.

SHAWN:
Boy, we really, we really should be going. (wipes his face with a napkin)

HENRY:
Oh, come on, guys. Shawn, stay. Your case will still be there.

SHAWN:
Uh, the sooner we can crack this case and move on, the better, believe me.

HENRY:
Well, this wouldn't have anything to do with the Wispy Sunny Pines suicide, now, would it?

SHAWN and GUS answer at the same time.

GUS:
Yes, sir.

SHAWN:
No.

HENRY:
(leans forward) Ooh, the plot thickens.

SHAWN:
Okay, it's true. Fine. And it hits a little close to home, seeing as how we were actually there the first time it happened.

HENRY:
The first time what happened? (points at SHAWN when he doesn't answer) Did you open your eyes?

SHAWN:
Dad, you've known me my whole life. Of course I opened my eyes.

HENRY:
Shawn, that is exactly why I refused to let you ride around with me.

SHAWN:
Dad, let it go. I was nine.

HENRY:
That is a lack of respect. Of protocol.

SHAWN:
Of protocol? Again, can I plead nine years old?

HENRY:
(chuckles) And you guys, you've been freaked out about this your entire lives?

GUS:
I don't even drive by that place.

HENRY laughs.

SHAWN:
I really don't think it's funny. It was a very scary thing for two young boys. Certainly puts a new spin on the nanny in The Omen.

GUS:
You know that's right.

HENRY:
Shawn, how much did you see?

SHAWN:
You know, we didn't... we didn't actually see it.

GUS:
Luckily, he missed the bitter, grisly end.

HENRY:
Luckily?

GUS:
Yes, luckily. I covered his eyes, but we know what happened.

HENRY:
I beg to differ. I think that you two missed one very small but important detail. She never jumped. (laughs)

SHAWN:
What? No. No, no, no, no, that's... that's impossible. We saw the window. She was gone.

HENRY:
Because one off-duty police officer pulled her back inside. "Scary" Sherry Craddock was rehabilitated. I'm pretty sure that she's married and living in Fresno. Come on, guys, give me some more credit here. I have no idea how that ridiculous urban legend got started in the first place. (gets up and takes plates to the sink)

SHAWN and GUS lean over the table and whisper so HENRY doesn't hear.

SHAWN:
Your big-ass mouth.

GUS:
I wanted to keep it a secret. You're the one who was broadcasting it at the lunch table.

SHAWN:
I can't believe this.

GUS:
We actually started an urban legend.

SHAWN:
That's dope!

They fist-bump right before HENRY comes over and sets a hand on SHAWN'S shoulder. He leans in and whispers.

HENRY:
Sometimes, Shawn, the answer is right in front of your eyes. You just need to choose to see it. (slaps SHAWN on the side of the face before leaving)

SHAWN:
That was creepy.

EXT. STREET, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS drive down a residential street.

SHAWN:
Whoa, this is it. Alice's house. I know there's something here. I've just got to find it.

GUS parks on the opposite side of the street from the house. They take off their seatbelts.

INT. ECHO, NIGHT

SHAWN:
Here's the plan. You ring the doorbell and distract who...whom. who? Whom?

GUS:
Whom...

SHAWN:
The person. The person that answers the door. I go around back, figure out a way in. (turns to open the door)

GUS:
Are you kidding? It took the whole ride to come up with that?

SHAWN:
Well, feel free to make revisions, Gus.

GUS:
How am I supposed to distract them?

SHAWN:
Oh, you'll think of something. Good luck. (puts a hand on GUS' shoulder) We're all counting on you. (gets out of the car)

INT. HARTHAN HOUSE, ENTRANCE, NIGHT

The doorbell rings and an older woman answers the door to find GUS on the step.

GUS:
Mrs.Harthan?

WOMAN:
(Scottish accent) No, the Harthans are down at the cemetery. I'm Poppy, the housekeeper. May I help you?

GUS:
Um, yes. Have you seen Mrs. Pickles?

POPPY:
Mrs. Pickles?

GUS:
Mrs. Pickles, my orange tabby? You must have seen her. She's pregnant with who knows how many unborn tabby kittens, and I've lost her!

EXT. HARTHAN HOUSE, BACKYARD, NIGHT

While GUS is talking, SHAWN sneaks in the backyard and into the house through a very large doggie door.

INT. HARTHAN HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

POPPY is serving GUS tea as they sit on the couch.

POPPY:
You know... (hands GUS a cup)

GUS:
Thank you.

POPPY:
...growing up in Edinburgh, my sisters and I had a basset hound who used to hoot like a snowy owl.

GUS:
No kidding? What'd you name him?

POPPY:
Eh, we called him "Basset Hound." Although my... my sister, she always used to call him "Uncle Jimmy." I never knew why.

Behind POPPY, GUS sees SHAWN sneaking about.

GUS:
(wails) Mrs. Pickles!

POPPY:
(hands him a cupcake on a plate) Oh, dear, your Mrs. Pickles will come back to you, D'Andre.

SHAWN walks out from the kitchen so only GUS can see him, mouthful of cupcake. He gives a thumbs-up. GUS wails again and SHAWN walks into the study.

INT. HARTHAN HOUSE, STUDY, NIGHT

SHAWN finishes the cupcake and begins to look around. He thumbs through a photo album and sees a picture of ALICE and DOREEN, each wearing friendship rings, the same two that ALICE now wears. His phone begins to ring.

INT. HARTHAN HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

POPPY looks around at the phone ringing.

INT. HARTHAN HOUSE, STUDY, NIGHT

SHAWN panics when he realizes the ringing is his phone. He runs back to the kitchen.

INT. HARTHAN HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

POPPY continues to look around.

POPPY:
What in the heaven's that?

EXT. HARTHAN HOUSE, BACKYARD, NIGHT

SHAWN stops and stares at the phone.

SHAWN:
I have got to set this thing on vibrate. (answers) I'm sorry, who is this?

EDEN:
(over phone) Shawn, it's Eden.

SHAWN:
Who?

EDEN:
(over phone) From Beta Kappa Theta. Are you coming to our party, or, like, what the heck? There are cops here and everything.

SHAWN leaves the yard and closes the gate behind him.

SHAWN:
Let me talk to Mary Lou.

EDEN:
(over phone) Mary Lou had to go to some candlelight vigil thingy for Doreen.

SHAWN:
Vigil? What vigil? There was--

EDEN:
(over phone) Yeah, at that creepy Wispy Sunny Pines place.

SHAWN sees tar on a drainpipe running down the side of the house and flashes back to what BETTY said about burying the gown at the tar pits. He surmises that ALICE followed them and removed the gown after they left.

EDEN:
(over phone) What about Bud? Can he come?

SHAWN ends the call and tracks the tar marks to an upstairs window. His mind then tells him how ALICE set everything up after sneaking out of her room.

INT. HARTHAN HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

GUS is sipping his tea.

POPPY:
Has anyone ever told you you look like little Bud from the old Cosby Show?

GUS:
Yes, ma'am, but I was not Bud. (cell phone rings and he sets down cup, pulls phone from pocket and answers) Hello? You bet. (ends call) It's her.

POPPY:
Who?

GUS:
Mrs. Pickles. She's home. (gets up and leaves)

EXT. HARTHAN HOUSE, FRONT, NIGHT

GUS meets up with SHAWN.

GUS:
I believe it was -

SHAWN:
It was her. And I've got the "how." We've got to go to Wispy Sunny Pines.

They walk to the car.

GUS:
What? No, no, no. You said go to the sorority house.

SHAWN:
No, the girls are fine. Cops are there. Meanwhile, Juliet's at some candlelight vigil with Doreen's family at the asylum.

GUS:
Wait a minute, no, no, no. The housekeeper just said Doreen's parents were at the cemetery.

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
(sees concern on SHAWN'S face) What?

SHAWN:
Oh, God. Of course. Why mess around with the worker bees when you can kill the queen?

GUS:
What are you talking about, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Gus, Alice! She wanted us all at that party, including us, so that she could get Mary Lou by herself! This is Silence of the Lambs! Which means we're both Scott Glenn!

They each go to their own doors but GUS refuses to unlock it, talking to SHAWN over the roof.

GUS:
Okay, Shawn, if I'm going to go back to that creepy-ass institution I've been afraid to drive by since I was nine, there's going to be some rules and regulations.

SHAWN:
Gus, this is no time for fun-

GUS:
Listen, Shawn! I will not enter a room first. I will not enter a room last. I will not investigate any suspicious noises, or go looking for a fuse box, and you will not, under any circumstance, leave me by myself without a weapon of some sort. Do you understand and agree to my terms?

SHAWN:
I'm not prepared to negotiate--

GUS:
Do you understand, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Yes! I do, yes!

GUS:
All right. Let's go help Juliet.

They get in the car and drive off.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NIGHT

GOOCHBERG is lying unconscious on the bed, machines softly beeping. LASSITER stands beside the bed, not believing that he is there. Suddenly, GOOCHBERG'S hand reaches out and grabs LASSITER'S arm.

GOOCHBERG:
Scarecrow, did we get him?

LASSITER:
No. No, of course we didn't get him. Your little pursuit sort of ended when you had a mild cardiac arrest. When were you going to tell me about the pacemaker? And how dare you try and scale a fence in high heels? He was the victim, Goochberg.

GOOCHBERG:
But did we get him?

LASSITER:
(moves to the other side of the bed) Yeah. Yeah, we got him, Goochberg.

LASSITER'S cell phone rings and he walks away from the bed to answer it.

LASSITER:
Lassiter. Spencer? Do you realize you are the second-to-last human person on this planet I want to be speaking to right now?

EXT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, NIGHT

JULIET pulls up in front of the abandoned building. There are no other cars there, and no lights inside. JULIET gets out of the car and stairs up at the building.

JULIET:
(sighs) Call for backup, O'Hara. Just make the call. Better safe than sorry.

She reaches into her purse and gets her phone just as it rings. The screen shows it's SHAWN. Just as she's about to answer, ALICE appears on the stairs.

ALICE:
Mary Lou! We're...we're over here.

JULIET puts away her phone, dons her Mary Lou persona and joins ALICE.

INT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, HALL, NIGHT

The hallway is lit with white candles of varying sizes.

ALICE:
I have to say, I'm a little shocked to see you here.

JULIET:
Where's everyone else?

ALICE:
Oh, upstairs. They're waiting for you. I told them you probably wouldn't show.

JULIET:
Well, maybe you misjudged me.

ALICE:
Maybe I did. Follow me?

ALICE heads up the stairs, also lined with candles. JULIET starts after ALICE but pauses and looks around.

JULIET:
Wow! This must have taken hours.

They continue upstairs to the next floor, also lined with candles.

JULIET:
I mean, this is really extensive. Candle-wise.

They continue upstairs to the fourth floor, also lined with candles.

ALICE:
The whole family's waiting in room 413.

JULIET:
Okay.

They arrive at room 413 and ALICE motions for JULIET to enter first.

INT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, ROOM 413, NIGHT

In the center of the room, candles are set in a circle. Within the circle is the nightgown covered in tar, spread out like it is waiting to be worn. Hanging above the circle are upside-down naked dolls. There are no people.

JULIET:
Alice, what the hell is this?

ALICE walks in behind her wearing a headset microphone and brandishing an axe.

ALICE:
(voice echoes) Welcome to the party, Mary Lou. It's a banquet fit for a queen!

ALICE swings the axe at JULIET who uses her purse to hit ALICE as she ducks out of the way. The purse falls to the floor.

JULIET:
(holds hands out placating) Alice, you do not want to do this. Give me the ax. I'm not who you think I am.

ALICE:
(voice echoes) No, you are exactly who I think you are. You're the reason girls vomit and starve themselves to death. And you're the reason that they fill themselves with plastic, and you are the reason that Doreen is dead. And so now, on behalf of the entire suit of the broken hearts, Alice will now lop off the queen's head. (laughs) That just sounded so much better out loud than it did in my head.

She lunges at JULIET, swinging the axe. She buries it in the wall next to JULIET'S head.

EXT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS pull up in the Echo just as LASSITER arrives in his car. All three get out and SHAWN rushes for the door, only to stop and look at LASSITER.

SHAWN:
Lassie! Our timing is really starting to crackle.

They hear glass shatter and screams from inside and they run into the building.

INT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, HALL, NIGHT

LASSITER enters, gun drawn. He pauses at the base of the stairs before running up them. SHAWN and GUS run in and SHAWN starts up the stairs before GUS grabs him by the shoulder and pulls him back.

GUS:
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! We made a deal, Shawn!

SHAWN rolls his eyes and motions with his arms for GUS to go first upstairs.

GUS:
Thank you.

They run upstairs.

INT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, ROOM 413, NIGHT

ALICE keeps attacking JULIET with the axe, but the detective keeps dodging out of the way.

INT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, HALL, NIGHT

GUS and SHAWN follow LASSITER. The detective steps over a fallen piece of furniture but GUS steps on a weak spot, his foot falling through and getting stuck. SHAWN runs past and GUS grabs at him.

GUS:
Get it out! Get it out!

SHAWN:
(weakly pulls on GUS' leg) Pull your foot out of the shoe!

GUS:
I can't! It's too tight! Shawn, Shawn, don't leave me, Shawn. That was rule number five.

SHAWN is torn between helping JULIET and not leaving GUS.

SHAWN:
Wiggle your big toe!

GUS:
I can't wiggle my big toe!

SHAWN:
Dude!

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Work the laces. (runs after LASSITER)

GUS:
Shawn? Shawn!

SHAWN catches up to LASSITER who is checking every open room, gun drawn. They hear a groaning coming from down the hall.

SHAWN:
Juliet!

LASSITER:
O'Hara!

They hear a woman scream and even GUS stops his panicking. SHAWN and LASSITER look at each other before SHAWN pushes the detective forward, taking cover behind the armed man.

INT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, ROOM 413, NIGHT

ALICE keeps attacking JULIET with the axe.

INT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, HALL, NIGHT

GUS undoes his belt and begins to wield it as a weapon.

INT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, ROOM 413, NIGHT

JULIET now has her hands on the axe and both women fight for possession of the weapon. JULIET literally gets the upper hand and pushes ALICE away with a hand to her face.

ALICE:
That is it! Now you die for sure! (rushes JULIET)

JULIET:
I don't think so. (punches ALICE who falls to the floor) You are under arrest, you crazy, crazy, crazy bitch! (holds axe menacingly)

LASSITER and SHAWN rush into the room.

LASSITER:
Detective!

SHAWN:
Juliet!

JULIET looks at them, panting, still gripping the axe. SHAWN approaches cautiously, not wanting to set her off.

SHAWN:
Hey. (puts his hands on the axe handle and tries to take it away) I got it. (JULIET lets go) I got it.

EXT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, NIGHT

LASSITER escorts a handcuffed ALICE out by the arm, followed by JULIET and SHAWN. VICK runs up with another detective and some officers.

VICK:
What the hell happened in there?

ALICE:
She's crazy. Look, she's possessed. You have to believe me.

VICK:
O'Hara?

JULIET:
You're asking me? I thought I was coming to a candlelight vigil. I thought I was coming to pay my condolences. Apparently, that wasn't the case.

SHAWN is tracing his fingers along the edge of the axe in front of ALICE, who seems mesmerized. Until he cuts his finger.

SHAWN:
Ow! (sucks on his finger)

LASSITER:
Give me that. (takes axe)

ALICE:
What would you have done, Shawn, if it was your best friend? What would you have done?

SHAWN:
Oh, no. Gus. (runs inside)

INT. WISPY SUNNY PINES, HALL, NIGHT

GUS is on his knees, sobbing and weakly flailing his belt. A strange deep voice echoes through the building.

VOICE:
Bud! Work the laces.

GUS realizes it's SHAWN using the same microphone ALICE used.

GUS:
Shawn! Come get me out of here! That's not funny, Shawn!

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK is working at her desk as LASSITER walks in.

LASSITER:
Did I upset you?

VICK:
(looks up) Upset me?

LASSITER:
Insult you? Demean you in some way that I do not comprehend?

VICK:
Detective, I'm pretty sure I have no idea what you're talking about.

LASSITER:
The woman. The crazy woman? The half-deaf litigating nightmare express of a detective. Why would you put me, of all people, with her? I'm head detective.

VICK:
Honestly, detective, I thought you two might hit it off.

LASSITER:
Why would you possibly think that?

VICK:
Well, she kind of reminded me a little of you. You know, a few years down the road. Similar interests, outlooks. Everyone thought it was a pretty good idea.

LASSITER:
That's how people perceive me?

VICK:
We're all a little surprised that it didn't work out, Carlton.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER walks out of the office and stops in the hall, waving and smiling at a couple of officers passing by. His smile falters when they ignore him. He then looks up and sees SHAWN sitting on JULIET'S desk, his partner in her chair and GUS in one pulled up to the desk. They were all laughing and eating Chinese food. He walks over, wanting to join in their conversation.

GUS:
(laughing) You sick mother...

SHAWN:
Dude, we could hear you from the fourth floor.

GUS:
Don't lie! Don't lie!

LASSITER walks away, ignored once again.

SHAWN:
Hey, Lassie!

LASSITER turns around in time to catch the fortune cookie SHAWN tosses at him. The three stop laughing and smile at him. LASSITER turns away and walks down the hall. A smile quirks his lips as he breaks open the fortune cookie and puts half of it in his mouth before reading the fortune.

Episode 1x7 Who Ya Gonna Call?

Sorry for the delay. Blame the holidays. Another week off as I work on the transcript for the Doctor Who Christmas special




1986

EXT. SPENCER HOUSE, DAY

HENRY is sitting on the front porch, feet up on the rail, drinking something cold. SHAWN jumps the front gate and runs up to the porch as another boy, RYAN BRICKHOUSE, stands outside the fence.

RYAN:
You're dead, Spencer.

SHAWN runs into the house and slides the door closed.

HENRY:
What you doing, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Nothing.

HENRY:
Looks like something to me.

SHAWN:
Okay. I was running away from Ryan Brickhouse.

HENRY:
That him?

SHAWN:
Mmm-hmm.

HENRY:
Is he the same kid who's been hassling you all week?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

HENRY:
(stands and walks to the door) Why is he chasing you today?

SHAWN:
I might have thrown a rock at him.

HENRY:
(looks towards RYAN) Did you hit him?

SHAWN:
Almost.

HENRY:
(slides door open) Get back out there.

SHAWN:
What?

HENRY:
You can't run away from the bad guys forever, Shawn. Eventually, you got to come up with a new approach.

SHAWN:
So?

HENRY:
So, find one. (gently pushes SHAWN out of the house)

SHAWN goes back to confront RYAN. HENRY watches from his chair. SHAWN sees that RYAN got an "F" in math. HENRY can tell SHAWN has seen something. And watches carefully.

SHAWN:
You're flunking math?

RYAN:
Probably.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Here's the deal. Leave me alone, I'll make sure you ace the test tomorrow.

RYAN:
How?

SHAWN:
Every third answer is "C." There's a pattern to all our tests. Mrs. Bodansky does it every time. I memorized it. I'll show you.

RYAN:
You better not be lying.

RYAN leaves and SHAWN heads back inside. HENRY stops him.

HENRY:
Not bad. You faced your fears. You got a new result. You came out ahead. Did you really memorize those test answers?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

HENRY smiles and picks up the phone and begins to dial.

SHAWN:
Who are you calling?

HENRY:
Your math teacher.

PRESENT DAY

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is playing a handheld video game. GUS enters the office and sees a gorgeous woman sitting behind the reception desk. She has her feet up on the desk.

SHAWN:
No, no, no, no, no.

GUS makes his way into the main office.

SHAWN:
Yes. Yes. Nickel. That's a nickel. Yes. Yes. Yes.

GUS:
Who is that?

SHAWN:
(doesn't look up) Who is who?

GUS:
The girl sitting in our front desk.

SHAWN:
Ah, you're talking about the lovely Dagmar.

GUS:
Dagmar?

SHAWN:
She's our new receptionist.

GUS:
How did she get the job?

SHAWN:
Agency sent her over.

GUS:
You contacted a temp agency without consulting me?

SHAWN:
Gus, anyone can get a secretary from a temp agency. It takes real foresight and creativity to get one from a modeling agency.

GUS:
A modeling agency? (peers into reception) Wow. Now, why would a beautiful lady like that want to be our secretary?

SHAWN:
Oh, that's a bit of a story, you see. (stands and crosses office) Apparently, she got it in her head that this was a runway gig. (phone rings)  I blame the agent. I was very clear on the phone. But she's cool with sticking around for the rest of the day and seeing how it goes. (makes coffee) You know how slow it gets when it's not modeling season.

GUS:
Does she answer the phone?

SHAWN:
Yes. But only her cell phone. She's expecting a call from Milan.

GUS:
Does she file?

SHAWN:
Mostly her nails.

GUS:
Coffee?

SHAWN:
Yes, she wants some. Can I make you anything?

GUS:
No. (sits at desk)

The phone continues to ring. GUS starts working on his laptop.

SHAWN:
Dude, I thought you weren't coming in till, like, noon.

GUS:
Big drama at the office today. A doctor we supply product to got killed.

SHAWN:
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn't call me immediately?

GUS:
You don't know him.

SHAWN:
Gus, this is what we do. Remember? We can solve the case.

GUS:
The police are already there.

SHAWN:
This means nothing to me. They're going to need help, guidance, psychic vibrations. (walks out to reception) Dagmar?

SHAWN speaks to her in German and she responds in kind, SHAWN then heads for the main door, GUS following.

GUS:
She doesn't speak English?

SHAWN:
Does she need to? (shakes head and leaves)

EXT. DR BLINN'S OFFICE, DAY

The area around the office is cordoned off by police tape. LASSITER and JULIET are there.

LASSITER:
Where in the name of all that is holy is my forensics team?

As the ambulance pulls away, we see GUS and SHAWN get out of the Echo.

SHAWN:
All right, what can you tell me about this doctor that I can pretend to ascertain from the spirit world?

GUS:
Dr. Blinn wasn't on my route. I did cover him a few times. All I remember is he always made you wait and he had a picture of Pete Rose on his wall.

SHAWN:
(sees JULIET) Look how cute she is in the fuchsia.

SHAWN runs up to the police tape like it's a finish line. The detectives look at him.

SHAWN:
I have been sent by the spirit of Pete Rose.

LASSITER:
Pete Rose isn't dead.

JULIET:
There was a photo of Pete Rose on the wall.

SHAWN:
Okay, why have I been drawn here? Was there a murder? Do I need the little booties for the crime scene?

LASSITER:
Thanks, but we're doing just fine.

SHAWN looks at JULIET with a pout and she lifts the cordon.

JULIET:
Don't go in the back room.

SHAWN and GUS duck under the cordon and walk inside with JULIET.

JULIET:
My grandpa loved Pete Rose.

INT. DR BLINN'S OFFICE, DAY

While SHAWN and GUS wait in reception, LASSITER and JULIET are in the main office. The body is on the floor.

LASSITER:
All right, I want you guys ringing doorbells. If anybody in the neighborhood saw anything, I want to know about it. Patient files.

JULIET:
Cabinet's locked. We haven't found the key.

LASSITER:
Get ahold of the DA's office. Tell him I need access to those files. If they say we need a warrant, get it. Also, get me a copy of his desk calendar. (heads out of the office and sees SHAWN and GUS) I thought I told you no.

SHAWN:
But your eyes said yes. Hey, who's that Cincinnati Red over there with the bowl cut?

As LASSITER turns to looks, SHAWN peers over LASSITER'S shoulder and sees a marble pyramid on the floor by the body, a mark on the doctor's forehead where he was struck, and a toothpick on the carpet.

LASSITER:
(turns back) Let me be perfectly clear. This is my crime scene. I don't need your help. I don't want your help. If you don't leave right now, I will have you arrested for interfering with a police investigation. Am I clear?

SHAWN:
Like butter.

LASSITER frowns at SHAWN'S remark and walks away.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is lying on the couch, pillow on his lap, tossing a ball into the air and catching it. GUS sits in a chair.

SHAWN:
I've given this a great deal of thought. I think we should take the rest of the day off. What say you?

GUS:
All we've done is eat up a box of animal cookies and crash a crime scene.

SHAWN:
The case with the doctor. They're coming back to us eventually. You know this. So, let's go to the beach. It's too nice a day for murder and mayhem.

From the outer office they can hear DAGMAR speaking in German as well as a MAN'S voice.

MAN:
I have to see him right now. It's important.

The MAN walks in followed by DAGMAR.

MAN:
I'm sorry. I don't mean to barge in, but I need help.

>>>LATER>>>

The man, ROBERT DUNN is sitting on the couch vacated by SHAWN, SHAWN and GUS are sitting in the chairs, SHAWN clutching a pillow in front of him.

SHAWN:
Mr. Dunn, Robert, how can we help? And can I call you Bob?

ROBERT:
This is difficult.

SHAWN:
Take your time. We're here.

GUS:
Yeah.

ROBERT:
I'm just gonna come out and say it. I'm being haunted.

SHAWN gets up and walks around the couch. GUS sits up straighter.

GUS:
Haunted?

ROBERT:
Yes.

SHAWN:
Haunting? (stands behind the couch and mouths at GUS "He's crazy.") Gus, can I talk to you outside?

GUS:
Not now, Shawn. We're in the middle of something.

SHAWN:
Gus.

GUS:
Stop talking. Sit down. (to ROBERT) Now, what exactly do you mean when you say, haunted?

SHAWN sits on the arm of the couch.

ROBERT:
Well, my home, sometimes I smell perfume when no one else is around. Things get broken or move.

SHAWN texts as ROBERT talks and GUS' phone buzzes.

SHAWN:
Oh, Gus, I think you have a text message.

GUS:
I'll get it later.

SHAWN:
I think you should get it now.

GUS reaches for his phone and reads the message: He's crazy!!! Let's go!!! GUS looks at SHAWN who jerks his head towards the door. GUS ignores him and puts the phone away.

GUS:
Sorry. Work business.

ROBERT:
Okay.

GUS:
(moves to couch) Can I ask you a question?

ROBERT:
Yeah. Yeah.

GUS:
Do these spirits ever speak to you?

ROBERT:
No. No. Whatever, whoever it is, it hasn't spoken to me.

GUS:
Oh. Have you contacted the police?

ROBERT:
Yeah. But they said that there was nothing they could do. So, here I am.

GUS' phone buzzes.

SHAWN:
(stands) Robert, we deal with this kind of phenomenon all the time.

GUS reads the text: He's not being haunted!!!

SHAWN:
What you need to realize is that evicting a spirit is a very time-consuming and absurdly expensive process.

GUS texts SHAWN.

ROBERT:
I don't care, okay? I just can't go on living this way.

SHAWN'S phone buzzes.

SHAWN:
Excuse me. (reads: We are taking this case!) Oh, really?

ROBERT:
Yes!

GUS:
Yes, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Look, all I'm saying is that it might be easier to try moving into a different house, one that's less haunted.

ROBERT:
I've tried that. Whatever this thing is, it followed me all the way from San Francisco.

GUS:
Maybe it likes you.

ROBERT:
No, I don't think so.

GUS:
What makes you say that?

ROBERT:
(pulls open his shirt to show bruising around his neck) I think it tried to kill me.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN looking through a magnifying glass as GUS is packing a large bag. DAGMAR is sitting on the couch reading a magazine.

SHAWN:
Gus, what is all this?

GUS:
Gear we might need. If we're going to be hunting spirits, we might as well do it right. Methodically, systematically, scientifically. Who knows, we might be surprised what we find.

SHAWN:
Video camera? Nice. Audio recorder, motion detectors. Gus, I'm very impressed. You only forgot one thing.

GUS:
Really? What?

SHAWN:
There's no such thing as ghosts.

GUS:
Yes, there is.

SHAWN:
Oh, Gus, no. Okay. Stop. Please. Let's just, let's just stop. Come here, sit down. Please, sit. (pulls over chair from desk as GUS sits in another) All right, this is me talking. This is Shawn. What's going on? I usually to have to drag you to these cases, kicking and screaming, and those are real police cases. Now, all of a sudden we have some client who's either bonkers or, judging by the size of the bags under his eyes, suffering from nothing more than waking dreams or hallucinations and you, you're ready to go ghost-hunting. Talk to me.

GUS:
All right. All right. (leans forward) I never told this to anyone before, but I was 12.

SHAWN:
Gus, it's me.

GUS:
It was late. I was in my room with the lights off. I heard a voice.

SHAWN:
Gus, I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation.

GUS:
No, no, no, Shawn. It wasn't on TV and it wasn't a radio. It was coming from the walls. And the voice, the voice told me that our house was built on an old Indian burial ground.

SHAWN:
Shut up.

GUS:
And she said... She said she was sad because she had died many moons ago and was trapped between worlds. When I asked her her name, Shawn, she said, "My name..."

SHAWN:
(mimicking woman's voice) "My name is Wilting Flower. I died without knowing love. Will you be my friend?"

GUS:
How did you know that? I never told that to anyone before.

SHAWN:
I was Wilting Flower. (stands) Gus! I can't believe that you fell for that. I put an old walkie-talkie in the wall when your (laughs) dad put in the new insulation. The old Indian burial ground, you bought that? I got that from Poltergeist or Poltergeist II. Gremlins? No, it wasn't Gremlins.

GUS:
(stands and points at SHAWN) That's not funny, Shawn. (walks off)

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER is at his desk on the phone, looking at his computer.

LASSITER:
You know what? Let's add a "Trixie" to that. She is the companion to "Scrappy", right? (on the screen we see he's looking at figurines) Okay, great. Let's add that to Girl With Flowers and Merry Musicians. (looks at notepad) Okay, now listen, I need the card to read, "Happy birthday. 'Ex' is the loneliest letter in the alphabet." But I need you to spell it, E-X, as in... Oh, you got it. Okay, well, see, it continues, "From your not yet 'ex', E-X, husband, Carlton." Perfect. These will go out today, right? All righty-dighty. Thank you very much.

JULIET comes up behind him.

JULIET:
I didn't know you collected figurines. You know, I have a grandmother...

LASSITER:
Do you not knock?

JULIET:
There's no door.

LASSITER:
And?

JULIET:
Sorry. The DA's office called. They said that we can have access to Dr. Blinn's patients' files.

LASSITER:
(stands) About time. (picks up jacket) Let's go get in there, get those addresses. Bring these nut jobs in for questioning. (puts on jacket as he leaves)

INT. ROBERT'S HOUSE, STUDIO, NIGHT

ROBERT shows them his studio. GUS is scanning the room.

ROBERT:
Here's where I found all my paintings last weekend upside down.

The device GUS is holding beeps.

GUS:
I've got a cold spot. Right here.

SHAWN walks over and stands next to him.

GUS:
Feel it?

SHAWN:
Yes. Yes, I do. Robert, we've definitely got something here. You're standing under a vent. (looks around and sees long red hair) So, all these are yours, huh?

ROBERT:
Yeah. I'm trying to get ready for a show.

SHAWN:
No kidding. Has anything strange ever happened here?

ROBERT:
Sometimes I get the feeling that the furniture has been moved.

SHAWN:
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Did you actually see it happen?

GUS is filming behind them as they talk.

ROBERT:
No, no, I just come into a room and everything's not where I left it.

SHAWN sees a class photo with ROBERT'S face crossed out. He walks over to the bookshelf where the photo rests.

SHAWN:
Robert, do you have a photo album?

ROBERT:
Yeah.

ROBERT walks over, takes the photo album off the shelf and hands it to SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Ah.  (starts looking through it) Hmm. That's a nice shot, huh? (suddenly flips the book over) I feel it! I feel it. (starts flapping the book like a bird) Oh, Gus, Gus, oh! Oh! She is angry! She is angry! She is soaring! With rage and... (caws like a bird) She wants to go to the bedroom! Where's the bedroom?

ROBERT:
It's here! Here!

SHAWN:
Take me! Oh!

ROBERT hurriedly takes SHAWN through the kitchen. GUS makes a face and follows.

INT. ROBERT'S HOUSE, BEDROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS follow ROBERT into an untidy bedroom. SHAWN squawks and slowly stops, dropping the photo album to the floor.

SHAWN:
I've lost her.

ROBERT:
(sits on the foot of the bed) You don't believe me, do you?

SHAWN:
No, no, of course we do. You saw it, too, didn't you?

ROBERT:
Guys, please, stay the night. Then you'll see. I mean, you don't know what it's been like. I can't work. I can't concentrate. I wake up in the morning more tired than when I went to bed. Days pass when I can't remember what I've done...

As ROBERT sobs, face in hands, SHAWN and GUS argue silently. SHAWN wants GUS to be the one to comfort ROBERT. They play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" and SHAWN wins, scissors over paper. GUS demands best two out of three. He takes the second round (paper over rock) but SHAWN wins the third (rock over scissors). GUS sits on the edge of the bed next to ROBERT and hesitantly puts a hand on his shoulder, patting him. ROBERT stops and looks at the hand.

INT. ROBERT'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

ROBERT walks into the room carrying a pillow and a blanket. SHAWN and GUS follow.

ROBERT:
This pulls out into a bed, but that's all I got.

SHAWN:
Oh, no worries. What's a little spooning between old pals, huh, Gus?

ROBERT:
Well, good night. (heads out)

SHAWN:
Good night, Robert. (pats him on the back)

GUS:
You got the floor.

SHAWN:
Oh, we'll make it work. (clears off the couch) You don't mind if I nude up for the sleepover, right?

GUS:
Seriously, Shawn, only one of us is sleeping at a time. The other one is on watch.

SHAWN:
Oh, no, we'll both sleep. I'll put on some socks, make you feel more comfortable.

GUS:
Stop playing, Shawn. We're here to solve a case.

SHAWN tries to open the sofa bed but can't.

SHAWN:
I already solved it.

GUS:
When? When you were flapping a book like a bird?

SHAWN:
(puts the cushions back on the couch) Gus, if you must know, it was a bald eagle. And, yes. (sits)

GUS:
(sits next to SHAWN) You found the ghost?

SHAWN:
There's no such thing as ghosts.

GUS:
Yes, there is, Shawn.

SHAWN:
No, there isn't, but there is such thing as a pissed off ex-girlfriend.

GUS:
What ex-girlfriend? No one mentioned anything about an ex.

SHAWN:
You didn't look at the photo album? (gets album and hands it to GUS) Redhead. She's cute.

GUS:
What makes you think she's an ex? (looks through album)

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, there's dirty dishes everywhere. His bedroom is a mess, his nails are filthy, his hair is horrible. No girlfriend is gonna put up with that. And, exhibit A, who else would "X" through his face in all these pictures?

GUS:
(stands) Okay. Okay, say she's the ex, we still don't know if she's actually been here.

SHAWN:
There are strands of red hair all over the studio.

GUS:
(looks in studio) Should we tell Robert?

SHAWN:
How psychic would that be? No, we'll spend the night. It's fine. Catch up with the ex tomorrow. Talk to her, see what's going on. Meanwhile, I'm going to do some sit-ups. Come hold my feet. (drops to the floor) I'm going to do a thousand.

>>>LATER>>>

A figure passes through the room as we see smoke. SHAWN is asleep on the couch in a T-shirt and boxers and GUS is asleep on a chair. GUS begins to cough. He wakes and sees the room his on fire. He gets up.

GUS:
Shawn! Get up! Fire!

GUS shakes SHAWN awake. SHAWN exclaims.

SHAWN:
Get Robert!

INT. ROBERT'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is surveying the damage from the fire. ROBERT is bemoaning his near-death experience.

ROBERT:
I could have died. If you guys weren't here, I... Why is it doing this to me? Why is it trying to kill me? (sits on couch)

SHAWN:
(pulls chair over and sits) Okay. Okay, Robert, hey, hey, hey. Hey, Bobby, look at me. Now, who here has communicated with more dispossessed souls, you or me?

ROBERT:
You?

SHAWN:
That's correct. Now, I am telling you that this, this fire was not an attempt on your life.

ROBERT:
It wasn't?

SHAWN:
No. This was a sad and desperate cry for help from a very frightened, very lonely apparition.

ROBERT:
Are you sure about this?

SHAWN:
Absolutely. Of course it's also possible that someone simply left a candle burning.

ROBERT:
I don't burn candles.

GUS walks into the room.

SHAWN:
Gus, did you burn a candle?

GUS:
Why would I do that?

SHAWN:
Cry for help it is.

GUS:
(whispers to SHAWN) No one came in while we were sleeping. I checked the doors and windows. They were all locked from the inside.

SHAWN looks at GUS' forehead and sees lipstick. He stares and stands.

GUS:
Why are you looking at me like that?

SHAWN:
That's all you did? Checked the doors and the windows?

GUS:
Yeah, why?

SHAWN reaches around and picks up a paper napkin from the table. He then presses it against GUS' forehead. He pulls it off to show the remnants of a kiss. ROBERT stands.

GUS:
Where did that come from?

SHAWN:
Don't look at me. I'm not wearing lipstick.

EXT. STORE, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET leave a convenience store. JULIET is carrying files.

JULIET:
This is the only post office box listed for Regina Kane.

LASSITER:
According to Dr. Blinn's calendar, she was his last appointment. She might have seen something. I want to find her.

JULIET:
Well, if this is where she picks up her mail, she probably lives close by.

LASSITER:
Canvas the neighborhood, see if anyone knows her.

JULIET:
That's a really smart approach.

LASSIETR:
(stops) What? That, that shocks you?

JULIET:
I meant that as a compliment.

LASSITER:
Really?

JULIET:
Yeah.

LASSITER:
(starts walking) Thanks a lot.

JULIET:
Was that sarcastic?

LASSITER:
(stops again) No.

JULIET:
Oh. Okay. You're welcome. (starts walking)

GUS: (v.o.)
Do you still think it's the ex-girlfriend?

INT. ECHO, ON THE ROAD, DAY

GUS is behind the wheel.

SHAWN:
A woman scorned is a woman with motive. We need to talk to this woman.

GUS:
You're on your own. I'm tied up with work for the rest of the week.

SHAWN:
Gus, that's so lame. Ooh. Pull over.

GUS pulls over to the side of the road where LASSITER and JULIET are walking.

SHAWN:
Good morning, detectives. Collecting donations for the Policeman's Ball?

LASSITER:
We don't have balls.

SHAWN:
I honestly have no response to that.

LASSITER:
Need I remind you, Mr. Spencer, what happens when you interfere with a police investigation?

SHAWN:
The case gets solved? Wait a minute, you guys are working on that murder thingy, right? I completely forgot about that. How's that going? (sees the name on the file) Silly question. We'll let you guys get back to your investigating. Bye, Juliet. (GUS pulls away) (v.o.) Okay, where to next?

GUS:
Listen, we change our clothes, we get some lunch, then I have to get back to work.

SHAWN:
Gus, the plot is thickening.

GUS:
Shawn, I've already missed two days this week.

SHAWN:
Oh, fine, fine, fine. I respect your wishes.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
Jerk chicken.

GUS:
You know that's right.

>>>LATER>>>

They have changed clothes and SHAWN is driving. "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" by Wham! is playing on the radio. GUS wakes with a yawn.

GUS:
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

SHAWN:
There he is.

GUS:
What time is it?

SHAWN:
Daytime.

GUS:
What happened?

SHAWN:
I might have dropped six allergy pills in your Frosty while you were peeing.

GUS:
You did what? Where are we?

SHAWN:
Palo Alto.

GUS:
San Francisco?

SHAWN:
No, but close. Robert's ex-girlfriend lives up here, Gus, and we really need to talk to her.

GUS:
I will kill you, Shawn. And then you're going to buy me some new tires.

SHAWN:
Oh, come on. This is fun. Road trip.

GUS:
Kidnapping. That's exactly what this is. That's it. We're not talking. (stares straight ahead)

SHAWN:
(looks at GUS) What, seriously?

GUS stares at SHAWN before looking straight ahead.

>>>LATER>>>

They arrive in Palo Alto.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
So, we're really not talking now? Come on, how mature is this? The silent treatment is not how conflict gets resolved, Gus. (pulls over) We need to work through this, we need to share our feelings, maybe a smoothie.

Without a word, GUS undoes his seatbelt and gets out of the car.

EXT. ROBERT'S GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE, DAY

The GIRLFRIEND opens the door to GUS and SHAWN on the doorstep.

GIRLFRIEND:
Yes?

SHAWN:
Never mind. It's not her. (leaves)

GUS:
Pardon me. (follows)

As GUS goes down the stairs, he sends a text. Just as SHAWN crosses the road to the Echo, his phone buzzes and he stops.

SHAWN:
(pulls cell from pocket and reads) What do I mean, "It's not her"? Lips. (pulls out napkin) The lips don't match. The lips that kissed your forehead do not belong to Amy Kessler. Therefore, she's not our ghost.

GUS texts again. SHAWN'S phone buzzes.

SHAWN:
(reads) "You didn't drive all the way out here so you could say, 'It's not her' and leave. We're talking to hep."

GUS texts again. SHAWN'S phone buzzes.

SHAWN:
(reads) "Her."

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER is sitting at his desk, an open shipping box in front of him. He reads a note.

LASSITER:
"Carlton, separation means apart."

JULIET:
What you got there?

LASSITER:
Nothing. (puts the box on the floor)

JULIET:
Are you okay?

LASSITER:
Of course I'm okay.

JULIET:
You look sad.

LASSITER:
I am sad.

JULIET:
Why are you sad?

LASSITER:
I'm sad because I don't have my forensics report on my dead doctor. Or a lead on my possible witness, Regina Kane.

JULIET:
What about that psychic guy? Isn't Shawn great at this sort of thing? Finding people. I mean, maybe we should bring him...

LASSITER:
(quickly) Maybe you should just keep your ideas to yourself.

JULIET:
That's a joke, right?

LASSITER:
Yes. Yes, it is.

JULIET:
Okay. (leaves)

LASSITER hangs his head.

INT. AMY KESSLER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is admiring a framed print on AMY'S wall. She is sitting on the couch.

SHAWN:
Very nice. Exquisite brush strokes.

AMY:
It's a print.

SHAWN:
I'm referring, of course, to the original.

AMY:
I'm sorry, what's the name of your gallery again?

SHAWN:
That's been a bit of a problem, actually. We wanted to call it Le Petit Louvre, but apparently the art snobs in France think they have a monopoly on all things Louvre. We also tried Louvre Two, Louvre, Junior, Night Gallery, nothing cleared. The important thing is we want to show the amazing work of Robert Dunn and he listed you as a character reference. Oh, we are very select with the clients that we take on, isn't that right, Francois?

AMY:
I have to admit, I'm surprised Robert would list me as a character reference. We dated for a period and it didn't end well.

SHAWN:
Can I ask why? Not to pry, but he did list you as a reference.

AMY:
The usual, forgetting dates, standing me up, sometimes he'd get so wrapped up in his work he'd disappear for days at a time. The worst was when he cheated on me and lied about it.

SHAWN:
Oh. You must have been burning with furious anger.

AMY:
He was just so stupid. A girlfriend of mine saw him at a club with another woman. He was drunk and pretended that she had him confused with someone else. He said his name was, get this, Martin Brody.

SHAWN:
Martin Brody? Roy Scheider's character from Jaws?

AMY:
Yes. How did you know?

SHAWN:
I've seen Jaws.

AMY:
It's his favorite movie. Anyway, when I asked him about it, he pretended he'd never even heard of the club.

GUS:
(French accent) That's... horrible. You must have wanted to kill him.

SHAWN:
Probably not so much anymore. You're pretty happily engaged, aren't you?

AMY:
(holds up hand) Yes. Isn't the ring great?

SHAWN and GUS plaster on fake smiles.

INT. ECHO, OUTSIDE PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

They are parked in front of the office.

SHAWN:
Okay, so she's not our ghost. Even the longest journeys can start with a tiny misstep. Overall, still a very good day.

GUS:
How is it a good day?

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, Gus. First of all, road trip, always fun. We got some fresh-baked sourdough, very nice. And the agency is sending us a new secretary tomorrow. And yes, she speaks English fluently.

GUS:
Shawn, we talked about this. We can't afford a receptionist.

A car starts up in the parking lot and SHAWN notices it.

SHAWN:
I don't think we can afford not to have one. Gus?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I think maybe we should move.

The car heads straight for them. GUS tries to start the car.

SHAWN:
Come on, Gus! Get it in gear! Go! Go! Go!

GUS backs the car out of the way just in time. The car drives over the curb and into a tree. The driver runs away.

SHAWN:
Hey! Hey!

SHAWN and GUS get out of the Echo and run after the driver but stop at the wreck. He's too far ahead.

SHAWN:
Guy's like a Whippet.

GUS:
Tell me about it. (leans into the car)

SHAWN:
What's the supersmeller say?

GUS:
Somebody had too much to drink.

SHAWN sees a toothpick on the floor of the driver's seat and laughs.

GUS:
What are you so happy for? We almost got killed.

SHAWN:
This was not an accident. Whoever that is was waiting for us and we have a new suspect for Robert's ghost.

EXT. ROBERT'S HOUSE, FRONT PORCH, DAY

SHAWN rings the doorbell a few times.

GUS:
He didn't answer his phone. Maybe he's not home.

SHAWN:
(peers through mail slot and sees a painting upside-down) Robert? Or maybe whoever tried to kill us last night also paid Robert a visit. And left the door unlocked.

INT. ROBERT'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter.

SHAWN:
Anybody home?

GUS:
Robert? (goes into the studio)

SHAWN:
Bob?

GUS:
Shawn, you might want to see this.

INT. ROBERT'S HOUSE, STUDIO, DAY

There is a message written in red on the mirror.

SHAWN:
"Save me. I'm trapped." Hmm. I don't want to jump to conclusions here, but this very well may be a cry for help.

GUS:
Maybe someone died here. Or was buried alive. This could be the cry of a tortured soul.

SHAWN:
So this guy just happens to move into two haunted houses in a row? (touches the writing)

GUS:
Don't touch that. It's blood.

SHAWN:
(sniffs his finger) It's not blood.

GUS:
Enjoy your hepatitis.

SHAWN:
(turns around and looks at the floor) And this tortured soul might be less tortured with a latex enamel. He wouldn't get these messy drips.

They follow the trail back outside to the porch.

EXT. ROBERT'S HOUSE, FRONT PORCH, DAY

The trail ends at a large chest that is blotched with paint.

GUS:
Now what?

They look up to a ladder that leads into an attic and exclaim.

INT. ROBERT'S HOUSE, ATTIC, DAY

The trapdoor is pushed open by GUS.

GUS:
I got it. I got it. I got it.

SHAWN:
Hallelujah.

GUS:
(peers around) Wow. (climbs out) You got to see this.

The attic is arranged like a dressing room with a vanity, hanging clothes, area rugs, plants and a lounge chair.

SHAWN:
(climbs through and grunts) Huh. Not what I was expecting.

GUS:
Okay, I know what I'm looking at, but what does it mean?

SHAWN sees pink pumps, a red wig and makeup.

GUS:
Is it a ghost?

SHAWN:
No, buddy, it's not a ghost.

GUS:
Is there a woman living up here?

SHAWN:
(steps down into the room) Well, that would certainly explain the perfume Robert's been smelling and all the red hair laying everywhere, but no, no dice.

GUS:
(joins SHAWN) Then, what is it?

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, Gus. Look.

SHAWN moves the wig on the model head up and down.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Robert is a woman.

GUS:
No, he's not.

SHAWN:
Not all the time, but sometimes.

GUS:
No. Doesn't seem like the type.

SHAWN:
He's not the type.

GUS:
Then how?

SHAWN:
Unless he has that personality thing.

GUS:
What personality thing?

SHAWN:
Oh, you know what I'm talking about. The multiple personality disease.  (peers in draped mirror) You know, that what's her name had, The Flying Nun in the other thing, the TV movie.

GUS:
Smokey and the Bandit?

SHAWN:
Yeah, dude, Smokey and the Bandit. Yes. What does that have to do with multiple personalities?

GUS:
You asked.

SHAWN:
I asked a real question. You were supposed to give me a real answer, not a random guess.

GUS:
Okay. Fine. Hooper.

SHAWN:
Hooper?

GUS:
Hooper.

SHAWN:
Hooper was a stuntman.

GUS:
Oh.

SHAWN:
I don't think Sally Field is even in Hooper. Who are you thinking of?

GUS:
(thinking) Oh...

SHAWN:
Terry Bradshaw.

GUS:
Yes. Is it Norma Rae?

SHAWN:
No, but that would have made that movie a lot cooler.

GUS:
The thing you asked about Shawn, is referred to as dissociative identity disorder.

SHAWN:
That's it! That's what Robert has, Gus. It all makes sense. (looks at shoes)

GUS:
Do you know how rare that is?

SHAWN:
I'm not saying all of Santa Barbara has it, just Robert. One guy. I think that qualifies as pretty rare.

GUS:
I don't know, Shawn.

SHAWN:
These are huge. (puts shoe back on shelf) Look. Think about it. There's two separate, but distinct personalities, one body. One's a man, the other's a woman. The female personality cooks dinner. Robert thinks the meals are the work of a ghost. The female rearranges the furniture. Robert thinks the ghost is moving things when he's not around.

GUS:
His old girlfriend did say that he would disappear for stretches at a time, which would explain when the female personality was in control, Robert would disappear.

SHAWN:
And he would have no clue to any of it. Now, all we need to figure out is how to bring out the woman so that we can talk to her.

GUS:
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (looks at the vanity) Triggers.

SHAWN:
We shoot him? Then what?

GUS:
(picks up perfume) No, no, sights, sounds, smells. (spritzes bottle) Something that would trigger the personality to come out. (sniffs perfume)

SHAWN:
Triggers it is. Gus, this is going to be kind of cool.

GUS:
Or weird.

>>>LATER>>>

The boys are back in the attic, this time with ROBERT.

ROBERT:
Where did all this stuff come from? Is this where she lives? The angry female spirit that you sensed?

SHAWN:
(hands to head) Oh, yes. I feel her very strongly here, Robert. Do you? Do you feel... pretty?

ROBERT:
What?

SHAWN:
(sing-song) Do you feel pretty? (stares at ROBERT)

GUS:
He means do you feel a... female presence?

ROBERT:
No, but I'm not a psychic. Do you think that you can...

SHAWN picks up the perfume and sprays it on ROBERT, who coughs.

ROBERT:
Communicate with her?

SHAWN:
I'm trying. I am. Sorry.

ROBERT:
Okay. You guys are starting to creep me out. So, if I'm not needed, I think I'll go back downstairs.

SHAWN:
Okay. Let me just put this away. We'll all go down together.

SHAWN puts the perfume down and sees Dr. Blinn's name crossed out on an appointment calendar and the name of Drake written in. He then remembers the name from the file Juliet had been holding: Regina Kane.

GUS:
You coming, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Yes. (stops at the rack of clothes) Oh, wow, Robert, these are some terrific clothes. I bet they look absolutely beautiful on you, Regina.

ROBERT:
Regina? Who...Who are you talking to?

Gus points at ROBERT.

SHAWN:
Yes. Yes, Gus, why don't you tell Regina how much you like her nice clothes. (drapes a pink satin jacket over ROBERT'S shoulders)

GUS:
Wow. Yeah, Regina.

SHAWN:
Regina.

GUS:
You look beautiful.

A change comes over ROBERT as REGINA starts to take over.

GUS:
Regina? Regina?

REGINA:
Thank you, Gus. I can't tell you how glad I am that you got my message. So, (puts a hand on GUS' shoulder) do you think that you can help me? Please.

SHAWN:
Dude.

REGINA:
This isn't right. (removes jacket) I must look horrible. (puts on kimono-style robe)

GUS:
No. Not at all.

REGINA:
You are too kind. But then again, I already knew that the way you comforted Robert. You are so sweet. (sits at vanity) Unlike most men, afraid to show their emotions.

SHAWN:
I've been hurt a lot.

REGINA:
Now if you two don't mind, I really must put on my face. (puts on wig)

SHAWN:
Wow. So, Regina, this message on the wall, this was your way of trying to get Robert's attention?

REGINA:
Well, he doesn't even know I'm alive.

GUS:
Why not write him a letter? Or an e-mail? Even a post-it even?

REGINA:
I tried. I really did try.

SHAWN:
But every time, something or someone stopped you.

GUS:
What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
I think there's another personality. Regina, there's another personality, isn't there? I mean, you don't smash pictures or start fires. You would never strangle Robert.

REGINA:
No, I wouldn't.

SHAWN:
Regina, the police would like to speak with you. They're investigating Dr. Blinn's murder. They think you might have seen something. You could be in danger.

REGINA:
(pauses putting on makeup) I didn't see anything. I didn't even go to my appointment. Why would anyone want to hurt Dr. Blinn? He was such a nice man and he was doing so much to help me.

GUS:
With what?

REGINA:
Well, you ought to know better than to ask that. That's between a woman and her doctor.

SHAWN:
Okay. (whispers to GUS) Unless you're going to ask her out, I think we're done here. How do we get Robert back?

GUS:
(whispers) I have no idea.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Well, you're her very special friend.

GUS:
(sighs) Regina? We would like to speak with Robert. Can you let Robert come out and play?

REGINA:
(turns around to face them) For you, of course I can.

GUS:
Thank you.

REGINA:
And I do hope that we meet again.

GUS:
Robert. Robert? Robert.

SHAWN:
Try Bob.

ROBERT turns to face the mirror and screams at what he sees. He pulls off the wig and tears off the robe.

SHAWN:
Easy, easy, easy, easy. We know it seems weird and... Actually, it is.

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
It's really weird. But we have good news. We figured out who your ghost is.

ROBERT:
Who?

BOTH:
You.

SHAWN:
You're haunting yourself.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the department, happy with a job well done.

SHAWN:
Yep. Life is good. Life is great. I mean, Robert gets the help he so desperately needs, we get to marinate in the delicious satisfaction of another job well done.

GUS:
And leading Lassiter to Regina, even though she saw nothing.

SHAWN:
That's professional courtesy. Plus it helps raise our stock, Gus. Ooh! Crime scene photos. Love crime scene photos.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk to a board with crime scene photos and notes. JULIET follows them.

JULIET:
May I help you?

SHAWN:
Detective O'Hara, what a truly pleasant surprise.

JULIET:
Mmm-hmm.

SHAWN:
I just dropped by to tell Detective Lassiter that I have... (looks at GUS) We have information regarding the whereabouts of a one, Regina Kane.

JULIET:
How did you know about it? Never mind. Stay right here. Don't move. I'll go find him. (leaves)

SHAWN:
(sees something)Ooh. (walks off)

GUS:
Shawn. Shawn, don't do this. (follows SHAWN)

INT. SBPD, FIRING RANGE, DAY

LASSITER places the figurines he bought for his ex-wife along the range as we hear "The Blue Danube" waltz. He goes back and puts in his earplugs and dons his safety glasses before taking out his gun.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN is looking at more photos on LASSITER'S desk.

SHAWN:
Gus! Look at this. Look at this. Look! Look! Look!

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Here, on the floor where poor Dr. Blinn's body was laying. A toothpick. (flashes to the crime scene) A chewed toothpick.(flashes to the car that tried ram them)

GUS:
Yeah? So?

SHAWN:
Don't you remember? The car that tried to ram us, on the seat? Chewed toothpick. Oh! Oh! That means the person that killed Dr. Blinn is the same person that tried to kill us.

GUS:
It's a chewed toothpick, Shawn. Lots of people chew toothpicks.

SHAWN:
Yes, but we were working for Robert. Robert is also  Regina. Regina is a patient of...

GUS:
Dr. Blinn.

SHAWN:
Yes! Take the baton!

GUS:
So, whoever the killer is knew both Robert and Regina.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK TO AMY'S HOUSE

AMY:
He said his name was, get this, Martin Brody. How dumb is that?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SHAWN:
Oh! Martin Brody. Of course! That's Robert's other personality. The violent one.

GUS:
But, why would he kill Dr. Blinn?

SHAWN:
Depends entirely on what Regina was seeing him for. (sees Blinn's files) Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Dr. Blinn's patient files. (moves to the files) All we have to do is find Regina's. (starts searching)

INT. SBPD, FIRING RANGE, DAY

LASSITER shoots the figurines. He smiles. JULIET comes up beside him, hands over his ears.

JULIET:
What are you doing?

LASSITER:
Hmm?

JULIET:
What are you doing?

LASSITER:
(takes out earplugs) Shooting. (removes glasses) It relaxes me.

JULIET:
(uncovers ears) Shawn Spencer says he has information for you.

LASSITER:
Where is he?

JULIET:
At your desk.

LASSITER:
Is anyone watching him?

JULIET:
Uh...

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN is going through the patient files.

SHAWN:
Found it! (opens it and reads) Oh, no.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Gender reassignment? Oh, Regina started feeling like a woman trapped in a man's body, so she wants to have her parts... (makes disgusted face)

GUS:
(makes disgusted face) Oh, my... Wait a second. That means if Regina was successful, both Robert and the Martin personality would also lose their parts.

SHAWN:
(squeals in imagined pain) Martin can't do anything to hurt Regina because he would only be hurting himself.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK as SHAWN and GUS speculate on what happened.

INT. DR BLINN'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN: (v.o.)
So, dressed as Regina, he goes after Dr. Blinn.

GUS: (v.o.)
That would explain how Robert got the marks on his neck. And with Dr. Blinn dead, Robert figured that Regina would change her mind about the gender reassignment.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SHAWN:
Right.

GUS:
We got that, Shawn!

SHAWN:
Only she hasn't. (flashes to appointment calendar) Gus, no, no, she found another doctor. She's seeing him today.

GUS:
When?

SHAWN:
(looks at watch) (hushed) Right now.

GUS:
Right now, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Like, in 10 minutes.

GUS:
Oh, okay.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER climbs the stairs and strides down the hall, Juliet at his side.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN falls into LASSITER'S chair, in the midst of a vision. He rests his head on his arm and whimpers.

LASSITER:
There had better be a really good explanation for this.

GUS:
He was in some sort of trance. I couldn't control him. (grabs the file from SHAWN and gives it to LASSITER) He says this is the killer.

SHAWN:
(whimpers) The killer, he's going to kill again.

LASSITER:
This is ridiculous.

JULIET:
Who? Who's he going to kill?

GUS:
What is it, Shawn?

SHAWN picks up a black marker and it leads him across the room as he wails and cries.

GUS:
Watch out! Watch out!

SHAWN stops at the glass door to the conference room and writes on the glass.

SHAWN:
Oh! (collapses to the floor)

GUS:
Dr. Drake?

INT. DR DRAKE'S OFFICE, DAY

DRAKE is sitting in a comfortable chair facing her couch on which is sitting REGINA - whom we see from the back.

DRAKE:
Gender reassignment? That's a big step, Regina. Why don't you tell me why it's important to you? (phone rings) It's okay. The machine can get that. This is your time.

The camera angle changes and we see REGINA from the front.

REGINA:
Thank you, Dr. Drake. (puts a toothpick in her mouth)

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is on the phone.

JULIET:
No answer. Just the machine. (hangs up)

SHAWN:
We have to go now. It could already be too late.

LASSITER:
(grabs jacket) Let's go! (runs out)

INT. DR DRAKE'S OFFICE, DAY

DRAKE:
I know this can be a difficult process, but it really is necessary to ensure that you're ready psychologically for a change like this. You do seem like an excellent candidate for the surgery. (looks at watch) Our time is up. (stands) Why don't we pick up here again next week? Okay, Regina? (turns her back)

MARTIN:
Okey-dokey.

DRAKE is bending over her desk as MARTIN stands.

MARTIN:
Only (picks up statue) my name is not Regina.

Just as he swings the statue at DRAKE, LASSITER opens the door and rushes him.

LASSITER:
Hold it! (tackles MARTIN onto the couch and pulls his arms behind his back) Get up!

JULIET enter, gun raised. SHAWN and GUS follow.

ROBERT:
What's going on?

SHAWN:
Robert? Bob? You back there, buddy?

LASSITER cuffs him.

ROBERT:
What am I doing here?

JULIET looks at GUS and SHAWN.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS is on the phone while sitting in one of the chairs.

GUS:
Great. Thanks. (ends call) Good news. They're going to admit Robert into the HT Windsor Facility in Chicago. And his doctor thinks his prognosis is good.

While GUS talks, SHAWN sits at his desk and looks back to the reception area, a puzzled expression on his face.

GUS:
Don't you understand, Shawn? (stands and walks to SHAWN'S desk) That's the premier mental health hospital in the country.

SHAWN:
That's good. That's awesome. Who is that?

SHAWN points back to the reception area where a handsome man is sitting at the desk, actually doing some work.

GUS:
Leslie.

SHAWN:
Oh. Oh. No, no, no, no. Leslie's supposed to be a swimsuit model.

GUS:
(gives SHAWN a file) Unfortunately, he is. Although, he says he's getting completely sick of the grind.

SHAWN:
I have to call the agency. They're completely misrepresenting their clientele.

GUS:
Leslie's a guy's name, too.

SHAWN:
(stands and whispers) Okay. We have to fire him.

GUS:
(whispers) Fire him? On what grounds?

SHAWN:
(whispers) What grounds? On the grounds that he's a dude.

GUS:
(whispers) That's discrimination. We can't do that.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Okay, listen to me. No woman is going to look at us twice if we're sharing our office with that ridiculous Adonis. He's better looking than both of us put together.

GUS:
Yeah. I'm not doing that.

SHAWN:
But, Gus, you know I can't fire people. They look too sad.

GUS:
This was your idea. Figure it out.

SHAWN looks at LESLIE'S file and gets an idea. We see LESLIE working on the computer. SHAWN slowly turns around and closes his cell phone. On the desk, LESLIE'S phone buzzes. GUS nudges SHAWN and they sneak out of the office. LESLIE opens his text which reads: You're fired!

Episode 1x9 Forget Me Not

1986

EXT. ZOO, DAY

SHAWN and GUS' class is on a field trip. GUS is walking right up by the teacher. The teacher is leading them through the grounds. There are other parent chaperones - one of whom is HENRY.

TEACHER:
Everyone stay together, please! Our next stop is the primate habitat.

SHAWN:
(to a girl in front of him) Hear that, Trish? Monkeys. We're going to visit your family.

TRISH:
Knock it off, Shawn.

TEACHER:
Now, some people believe that the next animal we're going to see is the ugliest creature in the whole animal kingdom. Does anybody want to guess which animal that is?

SHAWN:
It's definitely got to be Trish. (bounces tennis ball off her back)

TRISH:
I hate you, Shawn Spencer.

HENRY:
Shawn!

SHAWN looks back at HENRY, who motions that he has his eyes on him.

>>LATER>>

The children are watching the ostriches. One looks like it has something in its throat.

BOY 1:
I wonder what it is.

BOY 2:
Whoa!

SHAWN goes over to the TEACHER who is sitting on a shaded bench fanning herself. He sits next to her.

SHAWN:
Ms. Bodansky? I think the ostrich might be choking.

Ms. BODANSKY looks over at the ostrich and we hear it making choking noises.

MS. BODANSKY:
Oh, I wouldn't worry. I'm sure it's just... eating. Yeah, that's... that's how they swallow their food.

SHAWN:
Um, I'm pretty sure that's not food.

INT, SCHOOLBUS, DAY

SHAWN enters the bus followed by HENRY.

HENRY:
A tennis ball, Shawn? What are you thinking? What are you doing throwing a tennis ball at an ostrich? The thing could've died. The zoo would've made me pay for it. And I don't even know what an ostrich costs. (sits down across from SHAWN)

SHAWN:
I didn't do it. I didn't throw the ball!

HENRY:
Stop lying, Shawn. You're only making things worse!

One of the other fathers who had been walking with HENRY, steps onto the bus.

MAN:
Maybe he's telling the truth. Are you, Shawn? Are you telling the truth?

SHAWN:
Yes, sir.

MAN:
Did you see who did throw it?

SHAWN looks out the window at TRISH.

SHAWN:
No, sir, but I think it might have been an accident. I think they meant to hit me.

MAN:
I believe him. He's telling the truth.

HENRY:
With all due respect, Captain, you call the shots at work, not here. You deal with your kid and I'll deal with mine. You. Scoot over. (sits next to SHAWN)

MAN:
I believe you, Shawn. (winks)

The MAN winks and leaves. SHAWN looks out the window and sees the MAN go talk with TRISH.

PRESENT DAY

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is looking out the window and sees and older MAN and younger WOMAN talking outside. The MAN is carrying a briefcase that is practically covered in Post-It notes.

SHAWN:
Gus.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Gus, Gus, Gus, Gus, Gus, come here.

GUS:
What? (comes over to the window)

SHAWN:
Look at this. Isn't that...

GUS:
Trish Connors.

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and her dad.

GUS:
Whoa!

SHAWN:
Wow, she looks...

GUS:
Hot.

SHAWN:
I was going to say "vulnerable", maybe a little upset, but...

GUS:
I mean, she was cute in high school, but she sure has grown.

SHAWN looks at him.

GUS:
I wonder what Trish and Captain Connors are talking about?

SHAWN:
Why don't I just read her lips.

GUS:
Because you can't?

SHAWN:
Sure I can. Shh. (in high-pitched voice) I'm sorry, Father. I can't fight it any longer. I... love... Shawn. I'm in love with Shawn.

GUS:
(deeper voice) Stop pretending to be insane, daughter.

SHAWN:
"Daughter"? He calls her "daughter"?

GUS:
You know you belong with Gus. He's smarter and funnier. Plus he has abs like Bruce Lee.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Okay. If we're going to do the lip-reading game, we have to say things that are at least remotely believable.

GUS:
I am.

SHAWN:
"Abs like Bruce Lee"?

GUS:
Dude, they're coming in.

They rush away from the window. GUS takes off his jacket and heads into the kitchen. SHAWN sits in a chair facing away from the door.

GUS:
Act natural.

TRISH:
Hello? Is anybody here? (enters office) Oh, hey. Shawn. Um, you probably don't remember me...

SHAWN:
(has one hand to his temple and raises his other) Don't speak!

TRISH:
Oh.

TRISH waves at GUS who returns the wave before putting a finger to his lips.

SHAWN:
I'm seeing a face. A face from the past. (he turns raised hand so it faces her) We know each other.

TRISH:
Yes, we do.

SHAWN:
I said no speaking.

TRISH:
Oh, sorry.

SHAWN:
We were... classmates.

TRISH:
Yes... Sorry.

SHAWN:
Did we ever kiss?

GUS is not happy with the question.

TRISH:
No.

GUS is relieved by TRISH'S answer.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry. That image may very well be coming from the not-too-distant future. I'm getting a name. Connor. Trish? (spins the chair around) Trish Connors?

TRISH:
Wow.

SHAWN:
Look at you. My God, you look amazing. (stands) What are you doing down here? Wait. Why am I sensing your father?

TRISH:
(amazed) Dad.

CAPT CONNORS enters the office.


Yes. (clears throat)

SHAWN:
Captain Connors. It is so good to see you again, Sir. (shakes CONNORS' hand) Please, come in, guys! Sit down in our cushy chairs.

TRISH:
Daddy, you remember Shawn and Gus? We went to high school together.


I know who they are. That's Henry's boy. You don't have to speak to me as though I'm a child. Now, (puts on a pair of reading glasses even though he has a set resting on his head) the reason that we came to see you is that there's a, uh... um...(goes through scraps of paper)

TRISH:
Dad, do you want me to hold something, or...


No, no, no, not now, please. I just have to... Oh, damn it.

SHAWN sees writing on the cuff of CONNORS' shirt.

SHAWN:
Nobody breathe. I'm seeing something. Gus, there was violence. Murder.


Yes.

SHAWN:
There was a murder.


Yes, exactly. A murder. A one-eight-seven, and I solved it. You bet your ass.

GUS:
So, what do you need us for?


Because, damn it, I can't remember who's been killed.

TRISH:
Or who the killer was.

GUS:
Did you go to the police?


Oh, they're useless. All of them. Without evidence, they won't even speak to you. 30 years I spent on that force, but they still refuse to believe me when I tell them that there was a murder and that I solved it. But I'm having trouble remembering. Actually, remembering anything. That's why I'm here. To see if you could... maybe you could look into my head and see what I can't find there. You believe me, don't you?

SHAWN:
Yes, Sir. I believe you.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP, DAY

SHAWN and GUS approach the outside tables of the coffee shop.

SHAWN:
So, "your" Trish says that this is where her father comes every morning for his coffee. He was here when he thought he solved the murder.

GUS:
So?

SHAWN:
So maybe we'll see something that led an ex-cop to believe a murder had been committed. (GUS sits at a table) Plus... double chocolate mango pineapple scones. Apparently made fresh daily. What I'm saying, Gus... the morning is essentially a win-win... (looks down at a neighboring table and sees a crossword puzzle with distinctive "I"s) Oh, no.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Little "i"s. Gus, little "i"s. Little "i"s. We gotta go.

SHAWN starts walking away and GUS follows.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Little "i"s!

GUS:
What about Connors? What about the double chocolate mango pineapple?

SHAWN:
Forget the scones. There's only one person I know who...

Just as they pass the door, HENRY steps out with coffee followed by CONNORS.

HENRY:
Don't rush off on my account.

SHAWN:
(stops and turns around) Dad.

HENRY:
Shawn, you remember my old Captain, Brett Connors.

SHAWN:
Of course. Captain Connors. How are you, sir? (shakes CONNORS' hand)


Look at you fellas all grown up. How long's it been, huh?

SHAWN:
About a day.

GUS:
Less, actually.

INT. SBPD, DAY

A young WOMAN is standing in the lobby as police walk past her. She reaches out to JULIET

WOMAN:
Excuse me?

JULIET:
Yes. Can I help you?

WOMAN:
I don't know. My name is Sabrina. Vito. Sabrina Vito. And, um, I think that my boyfriend might be missing. (holds out MISSING flyers with boyfriend's photo) He hasn't called, and he won't answer the phone, and (voice breaks) I'm a little afraid that something might have happened. So I've been putting these up all over town.

JULIET:
It's okay. Why don't you come over here and sit down.

SABRINA:
Okay.

JULIET takes SABRINA to an area away from the crowd.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are sitting at the same table as HENRY, CONNORS and another old cop friend. SHAWN doesn't look all that happy to be there.

HENRY:
Oh, that's right, that's right. This chick was sunbathing naked in the plaza.

SHAWN:
No!

CONNORS
You should've seen your old man chasing her with the cuffs. This gal was so covered with suntan oil, every time he grabbed her, she squirted right out of his hands.

They all laugh and SHAWN notices a napkin sticking out of CONNORS' briefcase with notes on it about the murder he solved.

CONNORS
Reminds me of that 502 that we picked up that New Year's Eve over on Olive Avenue.

As CONNORS is speaking, SHAWN sees the missing poster of SABRINA'S boyfriend.

FRIEND:
How do you remember all this stuff?

CONNORS
Ah, it's easy. Like it was yesterday.

SHAWN:
Speaking of yesterday, Captain, is this the table that you always sit at? Because I'm getting something here. The murder? The murder? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You were sitting here when you saw the victim.

HENRY:
Shawn, what are you talking about?

CONNORS
Shut up, Henry. I solved a new murder, and your boy here is the only one who believes me. Now, let the kid work.

SHAWN:
I'm seeing a man... 5'9",5'10", tops. (points at HENRY) Shaved head.

CONNORS
Yes! Yes!

SHAWN:
Yes, yes... Uh, his name. Um, Mifu... Mifune? No. M... May... Mick... Mike! His name is Mike.

CONNORS
He was arguing over in the park with that bastard, Mort Crocker. A mountain lion. He pinned it on a mountain lion.

The others at the table look at each other, not knowing what to say.

CONNORS
Now, if I can just prove it...

HENRY:
All right, look, why don't I play psychic here for a moment? It wasn't a young man. It was a young woman. She's pretty. Brunette hair, nice figure, she liked to play Scrabble with her friends. Her name was Zoe.

CONNORS
Yeah, you're right. That's who was murdered. They said it was a mountain lion, but they were wrong!

EXT. STREET, DAY

HENRY walks to his truck and SHAWN runs after him.

SHAWN:
Dad, you're amazing. Maybe my psychic gift is hereditary.

HENRY:
(sighs) Shawn, Zoe Sharp is a young woman who was found dead 20 years ago, mauled by a mountain lion. Connors and I worked the case. (gets into his truck)

SHAWN:
So she was murdered?

HENRY:
She was in the wrong place at the wrong time. A tragedy, yes. A murder, no. Not then, and not now.

SHAWN:
Okay, okay, let's forget Zoe Sharp, may she rest in peace. But Connors still saw the guy on the "missing" poster arguing with Mort Crocker in the park. (HENRY gets out of the truck) What?

HENRY:
Shawn, we have no idea what Connors saw or what he didn't see. The man is ill. Early onset Alzheimer's. His mind, the past, the present, it's all screwy. It's all the same to him. So he sees Crocker standing there in the park, it triggers an old memory of Zoe, next thing you know, (whistles) he's living in the past. (gets back in truck)

SHAWN:
Dad, this guy's your friend. He came to me for help.

HENRY:
Shawn, leave him be. He doesn't need your help to make him look like an old fool. He deserves better than that.

HENRY drives away leaving SHAWN in the street, hands in his pockets.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS rushes into the office, a newspaper in his hand.

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN is sitting on the back of one of the chairs playing a hand-held video game.

SHAWN:
Run, little alien! Run!

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
You're going to want to see this.

SHAWN:
See what?

GUS:
Look.

SHAWN looks at the headline of the newspaper. There is a photo of the missing man, Mike.

SHAWN:
Uh, coincidence?

GUS:
I don't think so.

>>> LATER>>>

SHAWN is showing TRISH the newspaper. We now see a close-up of the headline: "Missing Hiker Dead; Mauled by Mountain Lion".

TRISH:
So when my father said he solved a murder, you think this is the guy that was killed?

GUS:
Well...

SHAWN:
It seems like a simple question, doesn't it, Trish? I'm afraid the answer is a bit more complicated. You see, as a psychic, it is important that I elicit the proper...

Behind TRISH'S back, GUS mimes SHAWN going on and on. SHAWN sees him and stops his explanation. He mimics the sound of a whip.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry. Raise your hand if you want to hear how my amazing gift works! Gus, you're so much better at this. Why don't you, uh... why don't you tell Trish how it works. I've got some...some stuff I need to do.

SHAWN gets up and heads for the other room.

GUS:
Sure. (escorts TRISH over to his desk) The answer to your question is yes, we do believe that is the victim. Please. (motions for TRISH to sit)

We see SHAWN in the pass-through sitting on a table reading.

TRISH:
So, what's...what's the next step?

GUS:
(sits at desk) Well, being that the authorities believe he was killed by a mountain lion, Shawn is going to attempt to elicit a... a psychic link with the suspect, in order to establish its guilt or innocence.

Through the window, we see SHAWN climb up on the table and imitate a chimp.

TRISH:
And by suspect, you mean...

GUS:
The mountain lion, yes.

TRISH looks into the other room to see SHAWN reading.

TRISH:
Amazing.

GUS:
Not really. It's fairly common for a psychic to be able to read different species of the animal kingdom.

TRISH looks back at GUS and SHAWN stands on the table and does an "undulating" dance move.

TRISH:
No. No, not that.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN looks at him.

TRISH:
The way that he's sitting there, so... quiet. I mean, in... in high school, he was always so loud, and needed attention constantly, and needed to be noticed. And he just would not shut up! He was so annoying. He drove me nuts! But now... (turns around and SHAWN is reading again) I mean, look at him. He's so calm, so unobtrusive. And the way he let you just step in and take over like that. I think he's really matured.

SHAWN looks over at the two of them and flips the book around so it's right-side up.

GUS:
Yeah. (reluctantly nods) Yeah, yeah, he has.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, EVENING

HENRY is trimming his hedge when SHAWN sticks the newspaper in front of him.

SHAWN:
Dad!

HENRY:
No! No!

SHAWN:
He was mauled by a mountain lion! You don't find that the least bit coincidental?

HENRY:
Of course it's coincidental, Shawn, but it doesn't make it murder.

SHAWN:
No, it makes it an episode of When Animals Attack: Santa Barbara.

HENRY:
Yes, well, mountain lions do attack in Santa Barbara. In fact, you watch the news, right? That's your source of psychic information? It happens.

SHAWN:
Connors came to me. He says, "I solved a murder".

HENRY:
Shawn, Connors was a good cop. And the thing that made him a good cop is he never accepted the easy answer. But that doesn't mean that he was always right. Obviously, somewhere in his mind, he's confused something that happened 20 years ago with something that's happened today. (throws shears into the ground and walks away)

SHAWN:
Okay, fine. (catches up to HENRY) Talk to me more about 20 years ago. (steps onto the porch blocking HENRY) How does Zoe Sharp connect to Mort Crocker?

HENRY:
(sighs and leans against column) Mort Crocker founded the Mort's family restaurant chain. He was the C.E.O. At the time, Zoe Sharp was his assistant, and there was a rumor... A rumor! That they were having an affair. (goes onto porch and pours himself some water)

SHAWN:
Nice. That's good stuff. And Connors knew about it?

HENRY:
Of course he knew about it. Every good cop makes it his job to know about things like that, but there was never any proof, Shawn. No proof! And even if there was, somewhere, in some corner of his mind there is a memory, a lingering memory, searching for closure.

SHAWN:
But then (holds up paper) he sees Mike here arguing with Mort Crocker.

HENRY:
Connors is not the most reliable witness, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Dad, he's onto something. One mountain lion, two mountain lions? Mountain lions!

HENRY:
You're right. You should talk to a mountain lion. (goes back to his trimming)

INT. VETERINARIAN LAB, DAY

SHAWN and GUS sneak into the lab. Set up on a table is a large cage containing a mountain lion. It growls when they walk in.

SHAWN:
Whoa! (imitates James Earl Jones) Simba! I am your father.

GUS:
I don't think Mufasa said that.

SHAWN:
Ah, Mufasa, Vader, I'm not Rappaport, it's all James Earl Jones.

GUS:
I'm not Rappaport was Ossie Davis.

SHAWN:
It still works. (sees a cut on the lion)

GUS:
We're not even supposed to be in here.

SHAWN:
Relax, I love cats, and it's been proven that cats love me.

GUS:
Well, this cat likes to eat people.

SHAWN:
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. (leans forward and talks like one talks to a baby) You're not going to eat anybody...

The lion roars and SHAWN leans back. They then run for the door to the outer lab

SHAWN:
No!

They stop when they are confronted by a zoo employee.

EMPLOYEE:
What's going on here? Who authorized you to be in here?

SHAWN looks around and sees two nametags on the counter: Dr. Hans Jorgenson and Dr. McTock from Cincinnati Wildlife Park

SHAWN:
Uh... (imitates poor Swedish accent) Please, excuse us. I am Dr. Hans Jorgenson, and this is my very distinguished colleague, Dr. Mc... (makes clicking sounds with his tongue) Tock.

EMPLOYEE:
I'm so sorry. I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow.

SHAWN:
(in character) We have arrived early.

EMPLOYEE:
Well, I am...I'm happy you're here. I'm Joan Walker, the zoo director. Let's see... (gets nametags and hands them over)

SHAWN:
(in character) Oh, look!

JOAN:
Dr. Hans Jorgenson.

SHAWN:
(in character) Look what they have done for us!

JOAN:
Dr. Mc...

SHAWN:
(in character) Uh, Dr. Mc... (clicking sounds) Tock.

JOAN:
Oh, Dr. Mc... (clicking sounds) Tock.

SHAWN:
Hmm.

JOAN:
Oh. What?

SHAWN:
(in character) Oh, it is nothing. You see, the Xhosa (Kosov?) language is very difficult to master, yes? It seems you have inadvertently utter Ed a vile Xhosa obscenity.

JOAN:
Oh, I am terribly sorry.

SHAWN:
(in character) Don't worry. My colleague only speaks the English at a very pre-school level, and he is very forgiving of others. For instance, yesterday, I poured the hot cocoa all over his genitals, and I say, "I'm sorry," and it's fine. (points to other room) Now, is that the man-eating lion that we have read so much about?

JOAN:
No, no. He's not a man-eater. No, no. If he attacked, it's only because he was malnourished.

SHAWN:
(in character) So, tell us, why is the cat so malnourished?

JOAN:
I really don't know. We had record rainfall this year. There's an abundance of foliage for his prey to feed on. He should be fat, but he's underweight.

SHAWN:
(in character) Perhaps it is because everyone in California is on the diet. Yeah? All of the surfing boys and the model girls. I mean, someone, anyone, please give them a sandwich, yeah? A meatball? Uh-huh?

The phone rings and JOAN excuses herself.

SHAWN:
(whisper) What is that?

GUS:
(whisper) I have no idea.

SHAWN:
(whisper) Cat doesn't look like it's eaten in weeks.

GUS:
(whisper) Doesn't make sense.

JOAN:
(on phone) Yes, this is Joan. Well, where's Dr. Zamfir? No, no. Stay right there. I might have someone who can help us. (hangs up phone and rejoins them) It seems we have a bit of a situation. One of our warthogs is ready to give birth, but our vet is away on an emergency. Could you please ask Dr. Mc... (SHAWN holds up his hand) the doctor, if, as a distinguished veterinarian, bring a new warthog into the world?

SHAWN:
(in character) Please excuse while we confer. Uh... pumbaa...

SHAWN and GUS both make clicking sounds.

SHAWN:
(in character) Meerkat.

More clicking sounds and GUS makes cooing sounds and SHAWN imitates a baby crying as he pretends to rock one in his arms. JOAN watches, stunned.

SHAWN:
(in character) He would be honored, yes. So just lead us the way.

GUS glares at him.

JOAN:
Thank you, thank you. (walks away)

GUS:
What are you doing? We don't know anything about delivering warthog babies!

SHAWN:
Oh! A baby's a baby, you just pull it out at the right time! The real question is, are you allergic to placenta?

EXT. WARTHOG AREA, DAY

We see the fencing and soon GUS comes running out, eyes closed tightly as he dodges back and forth, not sure of which way to go.

GUS:
Oh, God! Oh, my eyes! My eyes!

GUS finds a garbage pail and retches.

INT SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM

LASSITER precedes CROCKER into the room. JULIET follows.

LASSITER:
Again, Mr. Crocker, thank you for coming in. I know how hectic your schedule is.

CROCKER:
Don't mention it, Detective Lassiter. I'm never too busy to help Santa Barbara's finest.

They all sit at the table.

CROCKER:
Why don't you tell me what this is about.

JULIET:
Did you see this in the paper? (shows him the article about Mike)

CROCKER:
Yes, I did. Sad.

LASSITER:
We have information that you were seen with the victim the day before his body was found.

CROCKER:
No. It wasn't me. Why don't we just cut to the chase? It was that detective, Connors, wasn't it?

LASSITER and JULIET exchange a look.

CROCKER:
20 years, and he still can't let it go.

LASSITER:
I really can't say.

EXT. WOODS, DAY

They park the Echo on the side of a dirt road and walk towards a chain blocking the way.

SHAWN:
Mike's body was found on this trail.

The notice board has two signs stating the trail is closed.

GUS:
It's closed. Now what?

SHAWN:
Just hold on. Let me think a minute. Okay. I have a plan. It's a little crazy, but it might just work.

GUS:
Okay. What?

SHAWN:
(climbs over the chain) Dude! We totally made it! We're in!

GUS:
Shawn, in case you're confused, "closed" means "go away", "stay out".

SHAWN:
Yes, in the negative language dictionary, which is clearly the only edition you own. But in the positive language edition, "closed" means "come in, step over the chain, there's so many less people to trample all over what you're looking for".

>>>LATER>>>

SHAWN and GUS are on the trail.

GUS:
You really think you can track the animal?

SHAWN:
Perhaps you've forgotten about my extensive experience with the Native Americans, a proud and solvent people.

GUS:
Working at the Flaming Tomahawk?

SHAWN:
So you do remember.

GUS:
Shawn, you were a greeter in the casino, for a week.

SHAWN:
The only non-Native American to be awarded an eagle feather. Always remember that, Gus.

GUS:
Oh, please!

SHAWN:
(points at ground) Black lab! (points at different spot) Akita! (squats) Lizard.

GUS:
Okay, now you're just making stuff up.

SHAWN:
(stands) Flamingo.

GUS:
What if we do find these mountain lion tracks? What then?

SHAWN:
Well, we clearly follow them to the kill zone and look for clues.

GUS:
What kill zone?

SHAWN sees a spot on the ground and kneels.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Felis concolor. It's Latin for mountain lion. (sniffs) Let's follow them and see where they lead. (leaps over a rise in the trail) This is it.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
The kill zone. The kill happened here. Except...

GUS:
Except what?

SHAWN:
Except the drag marks are coming from that direction. (points the way they came) The lion tracks we followed are over there. If this lion dragged and killed its prey, the tracks and the marks should match up. They should come from the same direction. Gus, you know what this means?

GUS:
The murder didn't happen here!

SHAWN:
Exactly. This cat was framed.

Behind them, a park ranger pumps his shotgun and aims it at them.

RANGER:
I guess you guys can't read. This area is closed.

INT. RANGER CABIN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are sitting on a couch covered by blankets drinking soup.

GUS:
What are we doing here? I'm burning up in this thing.

SHAWN:
No, you're not.

GUS:
Yes, I am.

SHAWN:
You've been wandering, lost in the woods, for two nights and you're suffering from extreme hypothermia. Now, shiver!

The RANGER enters the room.

RANGER:
How're you feeling? Better?

SHAWN:
Oh, Ranger De Soto, this soup is amazing. Gus called it a chowder, and I'm tempted to agree. Do you think you might have any crackers to go with it? Perhaps those little oyster kind?

DeSOTO:
I'll check. (leaves)

SHAWN:
You're too kind. (shivers)

GUS:
Crackers? Really? For someone who supposedly drinks his own urine, your palate is suddenly very sophisticated. Let's get out of here.

SHAWN:
We can't. (sees plaques on the wall "presented by the Crocker Foundation") We've got work to do. I think there's more to this gun-toting Ranger than meets the eye. (sees a photo of DeSOTO with CROCKER)

GUS:
Like what?

SHAWN:
Well, for starters...

SHAWN gets up and walks to the display on the wall. GUS follows.

SHAWN:
He just happens to know the infamous Mort Crocker and his wife, Edna. Coincidence?

GUS:
Shawn, it's a fundraiser. The Crockers probably posed with everybody in there.

SHAWN:
What about the giant cage outside?

GUS:
What about it?

SHAWN looks out the window at the cage and sees a broken bit of wire with blood on it. He remembers the cut on the lion they saw at the zoo.

SHAWN:
I suspect that at one point our man-eating mountain lion was kept in that cage and sustained a small cut.

GUS:
Yeah, when they trapped him and took him to the zoo.

DeSOTO returns.

DeSOTO:
Sorry. All I have is saltines. That okay?

SHAWN:
(fakes shivers) Believe me, when you're starving, you'll eat anything, including the poop of indigenous beasts. Speaking of which, when we were lost out there, Gus here was little-girl scared that we might be eaten by some kind of wild animal. Does that sort of thing ever really happen?

GUS helps himself to the crackers, dunking them into the soup.

DeSOTO:
Well, it's not unheard of. Fact is, we had a guy killed by a mountain lion just a couple of days ago.

GUS:
Does that kind of thing happen often?

SHAWN stares at GUS as he keeps eating.

DeSOTO:
Oh, a few times in the past 50 years.

GUS:
(mouthful) I thought mountain lions were afraid of humans.

DeSOTO:
Generally, but if they get hungry enough... We've had a really dry year, (SHAWN and GUS look at him as this contradicts what they heard at the zoo) that means reduced vegetation, and reduced vegetation means fewer deer and the like for the lions to feed on. You can't really blame the cat. It gets hungry and it wants to eat.

SHAWN:
You mind if I ask you a question that's completely unrelated?

DeSOTO:
Sure.

SHAWN:
Is that real mahogany?

SHAWN and GUS look at each other, knowing how lame that was.

EXT. WOODS, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk down the trail.

SHAWN:
Now what do we know? We know there was plenty of rain this year, no reason for a mountain lion to be malnourished. Why was Ranger DeSoto lying?

GUS:
Why do people usually lie? He's hiding something.

INT. SBPD, RECEPTION, DAY

CONNORS enters in uniform

CONNORS
Henry Spencer back from lunch yet?

DESK OFFICER:
Henry Spencer? I'm sorry, who are you?

CONNORS
Never mind. Just tell him to come and find me. (walks to bullpen) We need to go over that Zoe Sharp file again.

DESK OFFICER:
Whoa! Excuse me, sir. You can't go back there!

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

CONNORS takes off his uniform jacket and hat and puts them on a coat stand before making his way to the nearest desk.

CONNORS
What the hell is all this? (opens bottom drawer)

LASSITER arrives with the DESK OFFICER.

LASSITER:
Captain Connors?

CONNORS
(pulls out file) Yeah.

LASSITER:
May I help you? This is my desk.

CONNORS
(removes glasses and looks up) Look, son, I don't know who the hell you are, but you're confused. This is my desk. It's been my desk for years. Now, you can either help me find the Zoe Sharp file or take a hike.

LASSITER:
You know what? Um, maybe there's someone we should call.

LASSITER bends over to take CONNORS by the arm, but the older man stands quickly on his own.

CONNORS
Hey, look, I don't have time for all this crap. I've got work to do!

LASSITER:
(takes CONNORS' jacket and hat from the stand) Sir, please. Don't make this difficult. (reaches for CONNORS to guide him)

CONNORS
(backs away) Hey, you want to dance, pal? (holds up fists) You just name that tune. Come on! (rocks on his feet)

INT. SBPD, LOWER LEVEL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter and proceed up the stairs to reception.

GUS:
I don't know, Shawn. Accusing Crocker of murder is a pretty big deal. It doesn't bother you we're missing little things, like motive, where the murder took place, or any kind of real evidence or proof?

INT. SBPD, RECEPTION, DAY

SHAWN:
News flash, Gus, the cops think I'm a psychic. I just have to get a feeling at the right time.

TRISH runs in the front door.

TRISH:
Shawn! Gus!

GUS:
What are you doing here?

TRISH:
My father, he's disappeared.

SHAWN:
What?

MAN:
Hey!

SHAWN:
C'mon!

GUS and SHAWN head towards the fuss.

TRISH:
Where?

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

A crowd has gathered in time to see CONNORS punch LASSITER in the nose. They groan in sympathy. As LASSITER feels his nose, CONNORS dances around him.

LASSITER:
All right, now you are starting to piss me off, old man.

LASSITER turns to face CONNORS, throwing the jacket and cap to another detective. COONORS throws a punch and LASSITER catches the fist and restrains him in a tight grip.

LASSITER:
Come here.

SHAWN, GUS and TRISH arrive.

LASSITER:
It is time for you to go. (starts bringing CONNORS to the exit)

CONNORS
(sees SHAWN) Henry! Henry! Tell them who I am!

SHAWN:
(looks around) Um...

GUS:
I think he's talking to you.

SHAWN:
Oh, God, please tell me I don't look like my father.

GUS:
You could be his twin.

SHAWN:
Look at the back of my head. Is my hair starting to thin at all?

GUS:
(smacks him) Shawn!

CONNORS
Henry!

SHAWN:
Uh, uh... I think we all know who this is. This is Captain Brett Connors, one of the finest cops in the SBPD, someone I'd be happy to share a squad car with.

LASSITER:
What the hell is going on, Spencer?

SHAWN:
This man happens to be my friend, now, let him go.

LASSITER:
(releases CONNORS and pushes him forward) He's your responsibility. Get him out of here.

TRISH retrieves her father's jacket and cap.

SHAWN:
Let's go, Captain.

They walk down the hall.

INT. SBPD, RECEPTION, DAY

CONNORS
I should report them all to Internal Affairs. They should be brought up on charges.

SHAWN:
I couldn't agree more. You head home, I'll draw up the paperwork.

TRISH takes her father home. SHAWN and GUS stop. SHAWN turns his head and sees SABRINA seating on a bench with the box of Mike's possessions.

SHAWN:
That's the girlfriend. (walks over) I'm sorry to disturb you. Was his name Mike?

SABRINA:
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

SHAWN:
Shawn Spencer, police psychic. I know this must be a very tough time for you. (sits on the bench next to her and pretends to get a vision)

SABRINA:
Sabrina.

SHAWN:
Sabrina. I am so sorry for your loss.

SABRINA:
You know, he'd come all this way, and lived so much, and his whole life can be condensed into a few items in this box.

SHAWN looks into the box and sees something on the bottom of a sneaker.

SHAWN:
Mike wasn't from here, was he? No, no. He was...he was visiting.

SABRINA:
Yeah, that's right. We were both from Pennsylvania. Mike came out here to search for his birth parents.

SHAWN:
I'm sensing a longing.

SABRINA:
He was so sad the first time he called me. He'd just found out that his birth mother had been dead for almost 20 years.

SHAWN:
(sighs) And that would explain the sadness that I'm feeling.

SABRINA:
But then, a few days later, he called to say that he thought he had located his birth father. I'd never heard him more excited.

SHAWN:
(reaches into box and lifts a sneaker) Did Mike bring another pair of shoes with him on this trip?

SABRINA:
No, no. Just what he had on him. It was pretty sudden, this trip out here.

SHAWN:
I see. Sabrina, (stands) I'm feeling that Mike does not want you to be sad.

SABRINA:
(stands) Can you tell me, did Mike get to meet his birth father? He said he was a really wealthy man and difficult to get to.

SHAWN:
(pretends to "see") Yes. Yes, he did. (sees prescription bottle for Biotin in the box)

EXT. CROCKER DRIVE, DAY

They walk from the parked Echo to the large front gates of the Crocker mansion.

GUS:
A biotin deficiency can be hereditary.

SHAWN:
Well, it's not exactly a paternity test, but let's see if Crocker has the same prescription. If so, we know Connors was right.

GUS:
This is a fortress. We need a plan. I don't think we can exactly just ring the buzzer and ask to peek into Mr. Crocker's medicine cabinet.

SHAWN:
Why not? That sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Why can't we be from the state board of medicine cabinet inspectors?

GUS:
I don't know, Shawn. I know I'm right on this one. Let's think this through.

SHAWN looks through the gate and sees a camera hidden in a fake birdhouse.

SHAWN:
No, Gus. Come on, let's go in without a plan, flying by the seat of our pants. It'll be so much more fun. Trust me.

EXT. CROCKER ESTATE, REAR ENTRANCE, DAY

SHAWN leads GUS around to where a number of vans are unloading product.

SHAWN:
See, look, man. There's some kind of commotion happening here. Planning a party. It's a piece of cake. They're never going to notice us.

They casually walk inside the gate and towards the house. A WOMAN in casual clothes and a large-brimmed hat stops trimming a bush when she sees them.

WOMAN:
Excuse me. Where are your badges?

SHAWN:
Oh, I don't need a badge. I'm the event planner.

WOMAN:
The event planner is a woman.

SHAWN:
Yeah, I'm her assistant.

WOMAN:
Also a woman.

SHAWN:
To the assistant.

WOMAN:
I'm calling security. (heads for the house)

SHAWN:
No, no, no, no! You don't need to do that.

WOMAN:
(turns around) Don't tell me what I need to do. The rules are very strict here.

SHAWN:
Really? You're going to let your bosses run you around like that? You're going to let the man hold you down? These freak bastards with their rules and regulations? You're a human person. You need to rise up and tell them to go to hell. We can all do it together. Let us empower you.

WOMAN:
I'm Edna Crocker, and you are one minute away from a squad car ride.

SHAWN:
Probably ought to let this one go.

GUS:
Yeah.

INT. PHARMACY, DAY

GUS takes lead.

GUS:
Hi.

PHARMACIST:
Hi.

GUS:
I'm here to pick up a prescription for a Mr. Crocker, Mort Crocker.

PHARMACIST:
One moment, please. (checks computer)

GUS:
Thank you. (backs up to SHAWN) See? You should listen to me every once in a while.

SHAWN:
That's not fair. I don't have access to medical files and doctors' names.

GUS:
Shawn, I called two pharmacies while you were being interrogated.

PHARMACIST:
I don't have anything for Mr. Crocker.

SHAWN:
(sniffs and acts like he's going through withdrawl) Are you sure about that? (leans on counter)

PHARMACIST:
Yes.

SHAWN:
Um... can I just get back there for a second? (sticks thumb in his mouth)

PHARMACIST:
I'm sorry, we don't have anything, and someone has already picked up all of his most recent prescriptions.

SHAWN:
Was it that bastard, Jimmy DeRucci?

GUS:
Shawn, please.

SHAWN:
Tell you what, before I, uh, (flails arms) before I go a little nuts, why don't you, uh... just give me the name of the prescriptions and we can get out of here.

GUS:
Okay, okay, see, it's a long-standing prescription. It needs to be renewed. No one's going to go nuts here.

SHAWN clears his throat like he's coughing up a hairball. GUS slaps him to get him to stop.

PHARMACIST:
(stammers and checks computer) Okay, no, I... I do have something, but they did... they picked that up over two months ago.

GUS:
Really?

SHAWN:
(hugs himself) What was that? The penicillin?

PHARMACIST:
No, it was his regular dosage of something called...

SHAWN:
Biotin?

PHARMACIST:
Yes. Is that what you're looking for?

GUS:
Yes, thank you.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET approach SHAWN, GUS, CONNORS and TRISH as they stand in front of the missing poster of MIKE. CONNORS is still in his uniform.

LASSITER:
All right, Spencer. You said you found an eyewitness for Mike McMillan's murder. Where is he?

SHAWN:
(pretends to talk to the poster) Okay, Mike. Go ahead. Tell the detectives exactly what you told me.

LASSITER:
You're kidding me, right? And we're out of here. (turns on his heel to leave)

SHAWN:
Mike says he was in town searching for his natural birth parents. If you don't believe him, you can ask his girlfriend.

LASSITER stops, hands on hips.

JULIET:
That's true. She told me.

SHAWN:
Did she also tell you that he found his birth father?

JULIET:
Well, what about his birth mother? Did Mike say if he found her?

LASSITER:
(walks back) No, no. He didn't say anything. See, he can't. He's a picture on a piece of paper. And dead.

SHAWN:
You should be ashamed of yourself. Mike said his mother was killed 20 years ago, right after he was born. (looks at CONNORS) Her name was Zoe Sharp.

CONNORS
I knew it. That son of a bitch. He killed her and now he got rid of the baby!

GUS:
He protects his business, his reputation, and he doesn't have to share his wealth. Sounds like a motive for murder to me.

LASSITER:
Really?

GUS:
Yep.

LASSITER:
(points at the poster) Then how do you explain the mountain lions, huh? (walks over to it) If you're so smart, how do you explain that?

SHAWN:
Uh, Lassie, why are you asking him? He was just a baby when his mother was killed. In fact, he wasn't even there.

CONNORS
Summer of '86 was hot and dry. There were a lot of fires. The lions were all going hungry. I remember some of them came right into town looking for food. Crocker killed Zoe and dumped her body in the hills. He didn't know about the lions, that just happened! They ate the evidence and covered his tracks! He just got lucky.

LASSITER:
What about this time? With Michael? What, he just got lucky again?

SHAWN:
No, not this time. This time he had help. Ranger Desoup...

GUS:
(quietly) DeSoto.

SHAWN:
DeSoto provided the lion.

CONNORS
DeSoto? I know that name. I just can't remember why.

SHAWN:
Sir, it's okay.

LASSITER:
Well, I got to hand it to you, Spencer. This is a terrific story. There's just one problem.

SHAWN:
I'm sure it's nothing that Mike can't help us work through. What is it?

LASSITER:
Crocker has an air-tight alibi. He was in Chicago when Mike was killed.

CONNORS
Oh, he's lying.

LASSITER:
I checked it out myself, sir. He spoke at a symposium in front of 200 other people.

CONNORS
No, no. Not again. Not this time. (heads for the car)

TRISH:
Dad...

SHAWN:
Sir...

TRISH:
Daddy?

CONNORS gets behind the steering wheel and drives off.

LASSITER:
He wouldn't do anything stupid, would he?

SHAWN:
Define "stupid".

LASSITER:
Go after Crocker himself.

They all realize this is exactly what he would do. SHAWN stops to take the flyer off the pillar.

SHAWN:
Trish, come on.

They run for their cars.

EXT. CROCKER ESTATE, BACK YARD, DAY

A string quartet plays Pachelbel's "Canon in D" as guest mingle with drinks around the tables arranged for the event. Two children run through and CROCKER reminds them of no running. As one guest greets another, CONNORS runs through and confronts CROCKER in front of two female guests.

CONNORS
Mort Crocker, you're under arrest for the murder of Zoe Sharp and Mike McMillan.

CROCKER:
Mr. Connors. I'm so glad you could make it. Why don't you help yourself to a drink.

EDNA walks up slowly.

CONNORS
No, no, no, no. You might fool all of these people, but not me.

LASSITER and JULIET run down the steps of the back porch and over to CONNORS.

EDNA:
Is everything all right, darling?

CROCKER:
Everything's fine, Edna. Please, go back to our guests.

LASSITER:
Captain Connors, sir, why don't you let us take you home. Pardon us for the disturbance. (CONNORS runs away) Oh, crap.

SHAWN, GUS and TRISH arrive and join in the chase. CROCKER and EDNA follow at a more sedate pace.

INT. CROCKER ESTATE, GREENHOUSE, DAY

CONNORS makes his way inside, and, in his hurry, knocks over a bag of potting soil. He ducks behind one of the tables just as LASSITER enters followed closely by the others.

LASSITER:
Connors! Oh, come on! Stop acting like a child!

SHAWN sees the potting soil

TRISH:
Dad?

JULIET sneezes.

SHAWN:
Bless you.

JULIET:
Thank you.

SHAWN follows the trail left by the potting soil and ducks down to find CONNORS hiding under the table. The older man holds a finger to his lips, shushing him. SHAWN nods and then sees the moss stuck to CONNORS' shoes. It's the same stuff that was on Mike's sneakers.

SHAWN:
(stands) He was here.

LASSITER:
Well, of course he's here. We saw him come in, Sherlock.

SHAWN:
No, no, not Connors. Mike. Mike McMillan was here. What? But...you sound all muffled. What, are you eating something? How can... Right, right, right. My bad. My bad. (reaches into back pocket, takes out the flyer and unfolds it) He was muffled. It was my fault. There. There, that's so much better. (holds the flyer so Mike can "see" what happens)

EDNA:
Please get out of here. Now. I don't allow anyone inside my greenhouse.

Some uniformed officers enter the greenhouse.

SHAWN:
Well, that's not exactly true, now, is it? You let Mike McMillan in, didn't you? I mean, this is where you killed him. You see, when Mike's spirit started talking about Crocker, I thought he meant Mr. Crocker, but he wasn't. He was talking about Mrs. Crocker.

The party guests watch through the glass doors.

LASSITER:
Well, for your sake, you had better be right this time.

SHAWN:
(to CROCKER) He came to see you, but you weren't here. What? Mike, you know I don't speak Italian. (listens) Shoes. He wants you to check the shoes that he was wearing that day. The soles. You'll find potting soil in the tread that matches that stuff.

CROCKER:
Edna, what's he talking about?

CONNORS
(comes out of hiding) Edna? (walks forward)

SHAWN:
Captain.

CONNORS
That's why I know the name. Before you were married, your name was Edna DeSoto! And you and your brother, John, the park Ranger, were in this together.

Flashback shows John DeSOTO dragging Mike's body in the woods.

CONNORS
He used the lion to cover your tracks.

EDNA:
(nervous laugh) You're not really going to believe this old fool?

SHAWN:
Watch who you're calling... (looks at flyer) What? I'm sorry, that was my fault, I just wasn't paying attention to you. Are you serious? It's in a bird feeder? No, I'll say it. There's a surveillance camera out front. (flash of SHAWN seeing it earlier) Apparently, it's in a bird feeder. And if the tape hasn't been erased, you'll be able to see him arriving on the day he was killed.

CROCKER:
Please, Edna, tell me you didn't.

EDNA:
What was I supposed to do? Someone had to protect everything we've worked so hard for! You would have given him half of everything! Just like you would've his mother.

CROCKER:
He was my son!

CONNORS
Detective, arrest this woman, and while you're at it, issue a warrant for the arrest of John Desoto, for the murder of Zoe Sharp and Mike McMillan.

LASSITER:
Officers, you heard the Captain. Get 'em out of here.

The two uniformed officers take EDNA away and CROCKER follows. TRISH runs over to her father and hugs him.

TRISH:
Dad, I'm so proud of you.

SHAWN walks over to GUS and they fist bump. SHAWN then looks down at the flyer.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP, DAY

CONNORS and HENRY are sitting at a table. HENRY is looking at a commendation award for CONNORS.

HENRY:
Show-off. (gives it back) Good for you. (pats him on the arm)

CONNORS
Yeah, thanks. It's a real honor, you know. I thought these days were long gone.

HENRY:
Does that mean you're coming out of retirement?

CONNORS
(laughs) What, are you kidding? I'm lucky if I come out of the fog.

HENRY:
Well, you got to keep your brain stimulated. Try the crosswords.

CONNORS
Nah, I like that, um, Sudoku.

HENRY:
Yeah. We could always go after cold cases.

CONNORS
Nah. Best to leave it to the young guys, huh?

They look across the patio to another table where TRISH is sitting with SHAWN and GUS.

TRISH:
Thanks for giving him this day. I hope he remembers it tomorrow. He can let go and move on, you know? Shawn?

SHAWN:
(distracted) Yeah? What? I'm sorry. I... got a little lump in my throat.

TRISH is touched, but GUS knows what he's leading up to.

SHAWN:
Speaking of lumps...

TRISH:
Yes?

SHAWN:
The ostrich? The tennis ball?

TRISH:
What?

SHAWN:
You know what? It's not a big deal, obviously. But it always bugged me a little. Why didn't you say anything, Trish?

TRISH:
Like what?

SHAWN:
Oh, I don't know. "I threw the tennis ball into the highly restricted ostrich area, and I let you take the fall for it."

TRISH:
You're serious.

SHAWN:
It's not too late to make it right. (points to their fathers) Right is right.

TRISH:
You really still have not grown up, have you? (stands) Wow. Goodbye, Shawn. Gus. (walks away)

GUS chuckles.

SHAWN:
(holds out arms) What?

TRISH walks over to the other table.

HENRY:
Hey.

CONNORS
Hey! There she is!

HENRY:
(stands) No, no. Here. (offers TRISH his seat)

SHAWN:
There, are you happy? (sips coffee)

GUS:
Yeah, actually, I am.

SHAWN:
Good.

GUS:
Good? You really want me to believe that you put your foot in your mouth deliberately? Please.

SHAWN:
Go get the girl. It's your move.

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Gus, will you go...

GUS:
Shawn, I told you. I do not need you to lay back for me to get a girl.

SHAWN:
Get over there.

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Show her the abs. (whispers) Show her the abs.

GUS:
Not until you challenge me straight-up.

SHAWN:
Fine. (sits up and checks watch) I will be kissing Trish...(sets timer) in 10 minutes.

GUS:
Not if I get there first.

They both get up and rush to the other table.

Episode 2x01 American Duos

1987

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM, BACKSTAGE

SHAWN is standing by the curtain, in costume as half of Tears for Fears. GUS walks up to him, dressed in the red pleather suit of Michael Jackson.

SHAWN:
What's with the Michael Jackson outfit? That's, like, two years old.

GUS:
I got scared.

SHAWN:
You were supposed to be Billy Ocean. (holds up TFF album) Why would Michael Jackson sing with Roland?

GUS:
Why would Billy Ocean sing with Roland Orzabal?

SHAWN:
'Cause he's awesome. Now we gotta add the moonwalk into "Shout" and hope the judges don't slam us for it.

GUS:
I don't know how to moonwalk.

SHAWN:
You better learn quick.

TEACHER:
(over mic) Shawn Spencer and Mr. Burton Guster. Let's give 'em a nice round of applause.

GUS and SHAWN part the curtains and walk out.

PRESENT DAY

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are sitting in the darkened office watching the TV on which a man and woman are performing "She'll be Coming 'Round the Mountain", the man beat-boxing. GUS is eating popcorn as he enjoys the show. The look on SHAWN'S face mirrors that of the judges on the program. Next up are two Asians singing "Ave Maria". GUS points at the TV and laughs. The third pair draw breath to sing but are stopped by the head judge, NIGEL ST. NIGEL.

NIGEL:
You're stiff. Inarticulate. Slightly jaundiced. Asymmetrical. You smell. The one on the right... there's something in your teeth. All in all, I'd say there's absolutely nothing worthwhile about either one of you.

GIRL:
But we haven't even sang yet.

NIGEL:
Apples and oranges. Anybody else?

The female judge, EMILINA SAFFRON answers.

EMILINA:
I like 'em.

NIGEL:
Well, of course you liked them. You've been asleep for the last 45 minutes. (looks to third judge) Zapato?

ZAPATO:
Well, I...

NIGEL:
Good. Moving on.

The host, LESTER, pushes the girls gently off camera before looking at it himself.

LESTER:
Coming up after the break...

SHAWN:
(motions to TV) You see what I mean?

GUS:
Shh!

SHAWN:
You're shushing me for reality TV? (GUS shushes again) Dude.

GUS:
Zip!

LESTER:
I'm Lester Beacon and this is American Duos.

SHAWN throws the squeaky frog at the TV.

GUS:
Rule number one, Shawn, no talking during Duos.

SHAWN:
Oh, for the love of Lori Loughlin. (lifts remote) Please use the pause button just once. (puts down remote) Why did we get TiVo if we never fast-forward and I can't stop for commentary?

The phone rings and SHAWN reaches for it but GUS slaps his hand down.

GUS:
Whoa, no calls either.

SHAWN:
Gus, don't be a rabid porcupine. This is just another knockoff of the other knockoff of the original knockoff of that other show.

TV:
And welcome back to American Duos.

GUS:
First of all, Shawn, look at the guy on the right.

SHAWN:
Zapato?

GUS:
He's not black. He's Latino. That's different. The contestants in this one are duos, which makes it way more compelling. They have to mesh, become one soul, like V'ger and Stephen Collins in Star Trek I. And they're shooting in Santa Barbara this year, which more than compensates.

The phone rings again and SHAWN grabs the handset.

GUS:
Don't you dare answer that.

SHAWN:
Dude, it's Jules. She could be bleeding and in a ditch.

GUS:
She's not bleeding.

SHAWN:
She could be in a ditch.

GUS:
She's not in a ditch.

SHAWN:
She could be lonely and in the shower.

GUS:
She has a shower phone?

SHAWN:
I certainly hope so. Dude, it's a win-win. Except for the ditch one. (answers phone) Hello? Nothing at all. We'll be right there. (stands, turns off TV and leaves)

GUS:
Shawn!

INT. SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS enter the building still talking about TV.

SHAWN:
That's it. I'm canceling the TiVo. No more frame-by-frame. No more Ghost Cat.

GUS:
I recorded that by accident.

SHAWN:
Then why didn't you erase it for three months?

GUS:
Fine, but I'm putting up the official Burton Guster spoiler alert. Until I get back and watch the recording, nobody utters a word about American Duos.

JULIET:
That's going to be difficult.

GUS:
Why?

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, NIGHT

JULIET leads SHAWN and GUS into the office. GUS stops when he sees the man sitting in front of VICK'S desk.

GUS:
(to SHAWN) That's Nigel St. Nigel. (to ST NIGEL) You know, you were totally unfair to Catherine Clement in season two.

NIGEL:
I don't remember the person to whom you are referring. But she was hideous. (to VICK) This is them?

VICK:
Yes, this is Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster, our resident psychic team.

NIGEL:
The answer is no.

VICK:
Mr. St. Nigel, this is exactly what you asked for. Hear them out.

NIGEL:
There's no reason. (stands)

VICK:
Hear... them... out.

NIGEL sits back down.

JULIET:
Nigel needs protection.

SHAWN:
Do you realize you're in a police station?

NIGEL:
(scoffs) I don't trust the police. They're useless. (turns to VICK) No offense.

VICK:
Oh, none taken.

JULIET:
Mr. St. Nigel has been the victim of a series of attempts and threats on his life by a crazed stalker. He believes that even the police could somehow be in on the conspiracy even though we've assured him that...

NIGEL:
(stands) I can speak for myself. And stop slouching.

JULIET straightens her posture.

NIGEL:
Every time I bring in some sort of professional protection my attacker gets closer. My car has been tampered with. My trailer has been broken into. Accidents follow me everywhere. What I need is someone who can anticipate my attacker's next move. Someone who can move about undetected.

SHAWN:
You're talking about a psychic. Someone who can see danger before it occurs. Someone who can say, "Nigel, duck!" before the bullet exits the chamber.

NIGEL:
Spare me the theatrics. Can you do it or not?

VICK:
(stands) Look, we are asking you to go undercover. No one outside of this office will know that you're on the job.

JULIET:
What about Detective Lassiter?

They look out the window to LASSITER at his desk.

NIGEL:
Absolutely not. His hair looks like it's been poured out of a cake mold.

GUS and SHAWN laugh.

SHAWN:
Nigel, get ready to feel safe. (walks over to JULIET) Jules, I need complete access to the theater. Green rooms, air shafts, spokesmodels...

JULIET:
Whoa, whoa, slow down. We need to think this through. Come up with a plan. You'll need to blend. Obviously the local police already know you so a false identity...

SHAWN:
I already have a plan.

JULIET:
You have a plan?

NIGEL:
What is it?

SHAWN:
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you wanted us to be stealth.

INT. AMERICAN DUOS STAGE, DAY

The judges are sitting at the table. NIGEL takes a sip of water.

NIGEL:
Bring on the next contestants.

SHAWN and GUS walk onstage, contestant numbers pinned to their shirts. LESTER follows them.

LESTER:
Presenting Shawn Spence Starr and Gus TT Showbizz. Good luck, guys.

NIGEL lowers his head to his hands and JULIET, standing backstage, drops her jaw in surprise.

GUS:
Hello.

EMILINA:
(looks at a notecard) So, what do you two hope to get out of the competition?

SHAWN:
Just hope to be here long enough to do something awesome.

EMILINA:
Mmm-hmm. Well, you know, round one is the most... (stares into space)

Everyone stares at her, waiting.

NIGEL:
Why don't you just go ahead?

GUS:
Warm up.

SHAWN:
(singing) I keep

GUS:
(singing) Tonight

SHAWN:
(singing) I keep

GUS:
(singing) Tonight

NIGEL:
You're warm. You're red hot.

SHAWN:
(singing) Talking away I don't know wha- What to say... I'll say it anyway.

GUS:
(singing) Slowly learning that life is okay.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Wrong verse. (singing) I'll be coming for your love okay. Take on me.

GUS:
(singing) Take on me.

The judges and JULIET listen in horror as SHAWN and GUS "mutilate" A-ha.

SHAWN:
(singing) Take me on.

GUS:
(singing) Take on me.

SHAWN:
(screeches) I'll be gone.

GUS:
(screeches) In a dream.

LESTER:
Really?

NIGEL:
Well. That was, um, something.

EMILINA:
Mmm-hmm. (bends shoe in hands)

SHAWN:
Something awesome.

EMILINA:
Honestly, guys. Bad news. I mean, this is gonna hurt. (puts foot on table to slip on shoe) Although I do love your style because you both chose to wear purple. But I think we need to be fort... forth... ford... forthright in saying that...

NIGEL:
That we cannot even begin to understand how brilliant that was.

EMILINA:
"Brilliant"? Are you crazy?

NIGEL:
It was real. It was rough. Post-post-postmodern, yet challenging. Sandpaper-esque.

EMILINA:
(stammers) They weren't even singing the same verse. I'm voting no.

NIGEL:
I'm voting yes.

EMILINA:
Well, it's up to Zapato.

NIGEL:
He votes yes.

EMILINA:
He hasn't even spoken.

NIGEL:
He doesn't need to.

EMILINA:
Zapato?

NIGEL:
Votes yes.

LESTER:
Come on!

NIGEL:
Jam a cork in it, Lester. We're moving on.

EMILINA:
Oh! (gets up and walks away)

LESTER:
Nigel, we all saw what happened with the Indian kid on that other show and...

ZAPATO leaves as well.

NIGEL:
(stands) Next!

SHAWN:
Look out!

A large spotlight falls where ST NIGEL had been sitting.

SHAWN:
(clears throat) Sweet! See you guys in round two.

INT. AMERICAN DUOS, STAGE, DAY

NIGEL confronts LESTER.

NIGEL:
Lester, this is ludicrous! I almost died...again!

LESTER:
Oh, it was an accident! Any fool could see that. We've had too many costly delays already. You're paranoid, Nigel! That thing could've almost landed on any one of us.

NIGEL:
But it didn't, Lester. It landed on me, you daft punk!

NIGEL storms off and LESTER makes a face at his retreating back.

INT. AMERICAN DUOS, BACKSTAGE, DAY

GUS and SHAWN find JULIET.

JULIET:
Have you guys gone completely insane?

SHAWN:
No.

JULIET:
What was that?

GUS:
Us advancing to the next round.

JULIET:
You got half the words wrong!

SHAWN:
Jules, those A-ha guys are Norwegian. They didn't even know what they were singing.

JULIET:
What are you planning on singing for round two?

SHAWN:
Yankee Rose, David Lee Roth.

JULIET sighs and drops her head.

SHAWN:
What? Too obvious? No, Gus can sing the guitar part.

JULIET:
Guys, if you're gonna stay in this competition, you're gonna need to step it up. Way up. Now, I have to go. I can't be seen talking to you. And not just because you're undercover.

SHAWN and GUS scoff as JULIET walks away.

INT. AMERICAN DUOS, HOTEL LOBBY, DAY

GUS and SHAWN enter the area where the hopefuls are waiting in line.

GUS:
Well, Nigel's essentially a monster. He's an equal-opportunity bastard. The list of suspects can be narrowed down to everybody. Even I kind of want to kill him.

SHAWN:
So where does that leave us?

GUS:
Well, there have been at least nine incidents that can be counted as attempts on his life... in nine different cities. We have to assume it's someone who's here every week.

SHAWN:
Great.

GUS:
No, not great. That only narrows it down to crew, security, and fans. Most of which are pretty die-hard. We're gonna have to talk to everybody, which is gonna be difficult, because I think I'm developing a polyp.

SHAWN and GUS hear wonderful warm-up singing and see it's the next guy in line.

SHAWN:
Yo! (they walk over to the guy) I'm Shawn Spence Starr. This is my partner, Gus TT Showbizz.

GUS:
The extra T is for extra talent.

SHAWN:
We just advanced to the second round.

GUY:
(shakes their hands) Congratulations! Bevin. Bevin Rennie Llywellen. I'm next, I think.

GUS:
I think you got us beat with that name already.

SHAWN and GUS laugh falsely.

SHAWN:
Where's your partner?

BEVIN:
I got rid of him. I sing both parts.

GUS:
The show's called American Duos.

BEVIN:
It's my hook. Everyone needs a thing, right? I learned that last year. Good luck, dudes. (walks past them to tryout)

SHAWN:
He did it.

GUS:
Him? You talk to one dude and you're done?

SHAWN:
His name is Bevin Rennie Llywellen.

They hear a loud whooping and a tall man dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt comes out of the audition room waving a cowboy hat.

MAN:
We made it!

A sullen, shorter man follows him. The MAN walks up to SHAWN and GUS.

MAN:
Hey, you fellow winners! Chance Cade. This here's my brother Rance. We just made it to the next round too.

RANCE just stares at them.

SHAWN:
Rance? Nice.

CHANCE:
Nigel just called us a curious cocktail of inbreeding and type 2 diabetes. But then he passed us through anyway.

SHAWN:
That's hitting below the belt.

CHANCE:
Yeah, well, Australian people are mean. (to RANCE) Hey, let's go.

The brothers leave.

SHAWN:
I was wrong, they did it.

GUS:
Shawn.

INT. AMERICAN DUOS, AUDITORIUM, DAY

A duo rehearses their dance steps, LESTER is on the phone, EMILINA and ZAPATO are getting makeup and SHAWN and GUS are up on a catwalk overlooking the auditorium.

GUS:
The stalker could've accessed the fallen light from up here.

SHAWN:
He sure could've.

LESTER looks up and sees SHAWN and GUS. SHAWN sees JULIET behind the dancers copying their moves. LESTER comes up next to them and grabs SHAWN by the arm.

LESTER:
You supposed to be up here?

SHAWN:
Define "supposed to be".

EXT. LOT OUTSIDE NIGEL'S TRAILER, DAY

GUS and SHAWN knock on the door if NIGEL'S trailer. HE opens the door wearing a silk robe and a green facial mudpack.

NIGEL:
How do you expect me to carry you two howler monkeys through tomorrow?

SHAWN:
Whoa.

GUS:
Well, I might've been a little pitchy. I had a dairy-heavy Jamba Juice.

NIGEL:
Stop the excuses. Step it up! I cannot carry you through another round. (steps onto the ground next to them) I think I preferred the stalker. (takes a cigarette from a case)

SHAWN:
Don't.

NIGEL:
Don't what?

SHAWN:
Uh, smoke. Those things'll kill you.

NIGEL:
Well, add them to the list.

SHAWN looks around and sees an open fuel line near a cut electrical wire.

SHAWN:
Stop! (wraps his arms around NIGEL)

NIGEL:
I do not have physical contact with people with arm hair! (shoves SHAWN away)

SHAWN:
That case. (takes case from NIGEL'S pocket)

NIGEL:
Was a gift from Les McKeown of the Bay City Rollers. It's a very expensive bla...

SHAWN throws the case into the puddle of fuel causing sparks and a small fire. NIGEL faints.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER strides down the hall towards BUZZ.

LASSITER:
How many do we got, officer?

BUZZ:
Alot. You're sure that you wanted everybody who was in the building?

They continue down the stairs where we see it crowded with contestants.

LASSITER:
Well, that's what I said, isn't it? Everybody inside, everybody outside. It's attempted murder. I'm not screwing around here.

BUZZ:
Okay, but...

LASSITER:
Just stop talking and open the door, please.

BUZZ opens the door to the interrogation room and precedes LASSITER inside.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER:
Really, McNab, you might want to open your ears for once. You could learn... (stops when he sees SHAWN and GUS sitting at the table before turning to BUZZ) Go get me some coffee. (BUZZ leaves and shuts the door) Great. What are you two doing down at that competition?

GUS:
We're looking for our big break.

SHAWN:
Do I get a phone call?

LASSITER:
No, I am trying to conduct an investigation. Out!

SHAWN:
Don't you want to ask us if we did it?

GUS:
Ask him. I plead the Fifth.

LASSITER fumes.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN chuckles as he and GUS go upstairs. JULIET is standing there.

SHAWN:
What's happening, undercover partner?

JULIET:
No public discussion of your undercover business.

SHAWN:
We need a choreographer.

GUS:
You need a choreographer.

JULIET:
You both have many needs. So?

SHAWN:
So I'm getting a very strong vibration that you can dance.

JULIET:
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Well, I did go to cheerleader camp. For two weeks. I got kicked out.

GUS:
Kicked out?

JULIET:
Yeah, it's a long story. Suffice to say I don't like liars who steal nail polish and then pass out when you slap 'em a little bit on the back of the head.

SHAWN:
Jules, listen. I can feel in my heart that you can get into the groove. Now, we need to step it up. Literally. And we need to stomp the yard. Figuratively. We've advanced to round two. This is an elite class of performer.

JULIET:
Shawn, 97 teams have advanced to round two.

SHAWN:
We're out of time. You're all we've got. Everything's riding on this! Step up to the plate!

JULIET:
Guys. (JULIET motions them to the side of the hall)  Sit.

SHAWN and GUS sit on the bench.

JULIET:
Okay, look. The only time I have ever danced publicly was in a high school performance of Everybody Hip-Hop!, which closed after two performances.

SHAWN:
Jules, all we do is argue. Gus is very stubborn. We need a guiding force. A Svengali, if you will.

JULIET:
Shawn, I'm a detective, not a Svengali.

SHAWN:
Jules, I...

JULIET:
Shawn, I think I would know if I were a Svengali.

SHAWN:
Fine. Whatever. I guess my heart vibes are jammed. Never mind.

SHAWN gets up and walks away. GUS stands, looks at JULIET and then leaves.

JULIET:
(sighs) Wait.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER is sitting casually at the table looking through an open file as ZAPATO checks his reflection in the two-way mirror.

LASSITER:
So what exactly do you do on the show, Zepado?

ZAPATO:
Zapato.

LASSITER:
It's immaterial.

ZAPATO:
(chuckles) I'm a judge.

LASSITER:
What kind of judge?

ZAPATO:
A talent judge. On camera. I sit on the far left.

LASSITER:
Really?

ZAPATO:
Have you seen the show?

LASSITER:
Yeah, a hundred times. I'm sure I would've remembered you.

ZAPATO:
(laughs) I can't believe this. I was the first person hired for the show. My first record went gold. (sings) M√≠rame. (points two fingers at his eyes)

LASSITER:
Well, you are spinning yourself into circles, whoever you are. Maybe you should go outside and rethink your story.

ZAPATO:
What story?

LASSITER:
Exactly. Get him out of here.

ZAPATO stands and an officer escorts him out.

LASSITER:
Keep an eye on that one. (hands the officer the file) Who's next?

BUZZ enters and hands LASSITER a file. EMILINA walks in behind him. She is a little "out of it".

LASSITER:
Yeah, great, the Bride of Frankenstein. Have a seat.

EMILINA:
(sits) What am I doing here?

LASSITER:
Well, let's see. Your trailer's right next to Nigel's. You hate him. And you can't seem to account for your whereabouts for most of the last 60 days.

EMILINA:
Everybody hates Nigel.

LASSITER:
And everybody loves Raymond. But everybody doesn't have a vacant sense of morality and an assault with a deadly weapon charge on their record.

EMILINA:
That was a publicity stunt. The "weapon" was a forklift and I was drunk on a spray bottle of Charlie.

LASSITER:
Well, I'm gonna need some answers, and fast. Otherwise you and I are gonna turn on the hot lights, do the Lindsay Hop and see who cracks first.

EMILINA:
Now you're trying to seduce me.

LASSITER:
I never thought I would make this sound in my lifetime, but... ew.

INT. HOTEL, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS follow NIGEL down the hall to his room.

NIGEL:
You left me alone half the day.

SHAWN looks at a room service tray and sees a sandwich held together with a pick shaped like a sword.

SHAWN:
You were at a police station.

NIGEL:
You'll never make it as bodyguards.

GUS:
We're not bodyguards.

NIGEL:
You'll never make it as anything.

NIGEL unlocks his door and they enter the suite.

INT. HOTEL, NIGEL'S SUITE, DAY

Food is set on a table as they walk in.

NIGEL:
Oh, thank God! I'm starving.

SHAWN:
What do you got there?

NIGEL:
My standing order.

NIGEL removes the lid from his lunch and hums as he shakes on some salt and pepper. He lifts the sandwich to his mouth.

SHAWN:
Wait! (grabs the sandwich from NIGEL)

NIGEL:
Give it back!

SHAWN:
No.

NIGEL:
Give it back!

SHAWN:
No. (throws sandwich across the room)

NIGEL:
What is it with you and throwing things? (picks up other half of sandwich)

SHAWN:
Don't eat that!

NIGEL:
Why the devil not?

SHAWN:
'Cause I'm getting a very strong feeling about this sandwich. It's...

GUS:
Delicious?

SHAWN:
No.

GUS:
Herb-crusted?

SHAWN:
No! It's not from the hotel kitchen.

NIGEL:
And?

SHAWN:
And...it's poisoned.

NIGEL drops the sandwich.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN, GUS, VICK and NIGEL are sitting around a table. VICK is on her laptop, NIGEL is looking through a paper as SHAWN and GUS play cards. LASSITER enters the room.

LASSITER:
Well, it stings, but it looks like Spencer was right. According to the toxicology reports, there's enough drugs to kill a Clydesdale in that tuna ni√ßoise salad sandwich.

NIGEL:
You see, your hotel detail couldn't even manage one room.

LASSITER:
Well, pardon me, but I'm not the one out ordering room service with a big target painted on my back.

NIGEL:
It was a standing order!

VICK:
We're almost through with the screen of your room, Mr. St. Nigel. You can return when we clear it.

SHAWN:
Fantastic, because to be honest, Gus and I have slightly more pressing issues at the moment. We need to rehearse.

INT. SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS exit VICK'S office.

GUS:
How did you know that sandwich didn't come from the kitchen?

SHAWN:
Easy, there were only 83 sesame seeds on his bun. All the other ones from the hotel have 87.

GUS:
Are you serious?

SHAWN:
No. The other ones have swords. Nigel's had a tooth pick. I'm not Rain Man, Gus.

GUS:
You sing like Rain Man.

They point at each other.

LASSITER:
Spencer! You missed something. We found prints.

SHAWN:
Was he in a little red corvette?

GUS:
Under the cherry moon?

LASSITER:
Fingerprints! They belong to Emilina Saffron. So do the drugs we found in the food. Cross-referenced them with her prescriptions and her medical records. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get a warrant. (leaves)

SHAWN:
Emilina?

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, NIGHT

EMILINA is sitting at the table as LASSITER stands by the door and simply watches, chewing on a matchstick.

EMILINA:
Where am I? Hello? Hey, I need my bag! (eyes focus on LASSITER) Mr. Bean. Thank God it's you. I really need my bag, please.

LASSITER:
And I need a confession. (sits across from her)

EMILINA:
I have a kid in Milwaukee. The father's Samoan. Can I now please have my bag, Tony Randall?

LASSITER:
(removes matchstick) I was thinking something more along the lines of... "I tried to kill Nigel St. Nigel by poisoning his tuna Nicoise salad sandwich with a dangerous cocktail of prescription medications I happen to carry with me at all times." (puts matchstick back in his mouth) Unquote.

EMILINA:
I have no idea what you just said.

LASSITER:
You're an even worse liar than my ex-wife.

EMILINA:
Ex-wife?

LASSITER:
Well, I mean, we're separated.

EMILINA:
Oh. So what you're trying to tell me is that you got a little hole in your heart? (takes LASSITER'S hands in hers) Come on. Fill it with Saffron.

LASSITER:
(nervously gets up and backs away) Okay... you know, I'm gonna go get a bite. And, uh, you think long and hard about what you did. And I'll come back, say, sometime tomorrow afternoon.

EMILINA:
I need my bag!

LASSITER:
Oh, I know. Don't worry. I'll take good care of it. (leaves)

EMILINA:
No, I need my bag now!

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, NIGHT

VICK is standing in the room as LASSITER joins her. In the interrogation room, EMILINA grips her head in her hands and shakes it as she "freaks out" in some form of withdrawl.

VICK:
I don't know, Detective.

LASSITER:
Oh, come on. Please don't tell me you're buying this dog and pony show. It's an act. It's the perfect cover-up.

VICK:
Well, it's pretty convincing.

LASSITER:
Oh, she's good, but I'm better. I'm gonna crack her like a bad back.

VICK:
Please don't.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

JULIET is dressed in what could be 80s dance gear complete with leg warmers, headband and off-the-shoulder sweatshirt as she prepares to teach SHAWN and GUS to dance. She starts the CD player and "Shout" by Tears for Fears begins. JULIET stands in front of SHAWN and GUS and the three start the routine. She then gets a little carried away and SHAWN and GUS just watch until she turns around and they fake the finish. Frustrated, JULIET turns off the CD.

GUS:
Damn, girl!

SHAWN:
It's okay, Jules. You can be straight with us. We can handle it.

JULIET:
Really? 'Cause that was awful.

GUS:
Awful?

JULIET:
(like drill sergeant) Can I teach you how to crump? Maybe. That's up to you. But I can't reach inside of you and make you want this. I mean, absolutely need this. The way that both Hall and Oates used to need it. Well, Oates a little bit more, probably. This has to come from inside here. And deep, deep, deep... inside here.(puts a hand to her gut)

SHAWN:
Jules. You do realize that there is a suspect in custody and the case is just about closed.

JULIET:
Is that what this laissez-faire, half-baked effort is about, huh? The case? I thought you were in it to win it!

SHAWN:
Jules, are you feeling okay?

JULIET:
Sharp as cheddar. You know, I wouldn't put all my eggs in Emilina's basket, Shawn. She's barely lucid enough to form word endings, much less plan a series of attacks on Nigel's life.

SHAWN:
She could be like Keyser Soze.

GUS:
With one shoe.

JULIET:
I think, until we get a confession, we gotta keep our eyes on the prize. Now let's take it back to the broken melting robot, huh? Gus... watch me! 5, 6, 7, 8...

JULIET starts doing the Robot and GUS and SHAWN slowly follow.

INT. HOTEL, NIGEL'S SUITE, DAY

NIGEL is sitting at the table singing "She'll be Comin' 'Round the Mountain" softly. There's a knock on the door and he gets up and peers through the peephole to see BUZZ waiting outside. NIGEL opens the door.

BUZZ:
(holds up shopping bag) Instant noodles, Danish, Diet Coke.

NIGEL:
Took you long enough. (takes the bag) I assumed that You see what I'm reduced to? I can't even eat real food.

BUZZ:
I'll take the noodles if you don't want them.

NIGEL glares at BUZZ who steps back into the hall, closing the door behind him.

NIGEL:
Here we go.

NIGEL pours bottled water into the noodles and then puts it into the microwave, continuing his singing. He sits back down in the chair and picks up a newspaper. He sniffs the air. There is a knock on the door and NIGEL opens it for BUZZ.

NIGEL:
Oh, bugger off, you silly giraffe.

BUZZ:
Is something burning in here?

They both sniff the air.

NIGEL:
What is that?

The microwave beeps as the timer counts down. BUZZ grabs NIGEL and pulls him out into the hall seconds before the microwave explodes taking half the room down.

INT. HOTEL, HALL, DAY

NIGEL and BUZZ are lying on the floor covered in dust and glass, the officer's arms wrapped around the older man.

BUZZ:
You all right?

NIGEL:
Peachy. Now let me go.

BUZZ releases NIGEL.

EXT. DAY

GUS pulls the Echo off to the side of the road near the water.

INT. ECHO, DAY

NIGEL is in the back seat. GUS and SHAWN look like they are at the end of their tether.

NIGEL:
Are we there yet? I feel like I've been incarcerated in a blueberry.

GUS:
Shawn.

NIGEL:
This car makes me want to weep and then die.

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Nigel, you asked for a safe house where absolutely no one can find you. That means we have to venture off the beaten path just a little. Relax.

EXT. DAY

They get out of the car and walk around to the driver's side. NIGEL is none too happy about where they are.

NIGEL:
Good Lord! Who lives here? The Boringtons?

They're outside HENRY'S house.

SHAWN:
(turns to GUS) There's a better-than-decent chance this goes poorly.

GUS:
I don't care. I'm starving. (starts for the house)

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER is sitting with his feet up on the window sill as he eats a sandwich while EMILINA is lying on the table in the interrogation room. She sits up suddenly, scratching her head with a shoe. She stops in realization.

EMILINA:
Wait! Hey! (throws shoe at mirror) Hey, I remember something! (stands and presses against the mirror) Hurry up, I'm lucid. I'm not kidding. Come in here right now and bring my bag. Hello? Come on! Come on, Count Chocula! I know you're in there! Don't make me pee on something. Again!

LASSITER gets up in a hurry.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER enters the room.

EMILINA:
Well, it took you long enough, I'm dying in here.

LASSITER:
Yeah, it's called withdrawal. Are you ready to confess?

EMILINA:
No, see, that's the thing. First of all, I remember somebody getting into my purse yesterday.

LASSITER:
When?

EMILINA:
I don't remember, but I was sleeping, and they were diggin' around in my purse right in front of me.

LASSITER:
Well, who was it?

EMILINA:
I can't be sure. I thought I was dreaming. But it might've been a werewolf.

LASSITER:
Might've been?

EMILINA:
Yes, and another thing... I wasn't even at the hotel this morning! I slept on a car in the parking lot. That makes me innocent.

LASSITER:
You slept on a car?

EMILINA:
Well, yeah. It... it's a long story. I usually sleep in the lifeguard station, but I didn't want to make a scene, so...

LASSITER:
Your fingerprints are all over Nigel's room.

EMILINA:
We hook up sometimes. I went to his room yesterday to see if he was lonely. It was a moment of weakness. (LASSITER heads for the door) A girl's got needs.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, NIGHT

SHAWN, GUS and NIGEL are sitting at the table. NIGEL is wearing a plush white robe. HENRY enters with a platter of steaks and begins to serve.

HENRY:
All right, gentlemen. Prepare to taste the most succulent, evenly-marinated beef that you have ev... Is that my robe?

NIGEL:
It is indeed, Horace. And it is comforting me at an elite spa level. I think I should also point out that I'm absolutely famished and those filets actually smell promising.

SHAWN:
Sweet. (prepares to pour steak sauce)

GUS:
(takes steak sauce from SHAWN) That's what I'm talking about.

HENRY:
It's Henry. They're rib eyes. (drops steak onto NIGEL'S plate and NIGEL stares at him) Is there a problem?

NIGEL:
Well, look at it. It's still got the marks where the jockey was hitting it.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

EMILINA is sitting on the table when LASSITER enters.

LASSITER:
You're free. (gives EMILINA her bag) Parking lot attendants confirmed your alibi.

EMILINA:
(hugs bag) So I can go? (kisses bag)

LASSITER:
The sooner the better. (EMILINA hugs him) And for God's sakes, take a shower.

EMILINA:
I'll never forget you. What was your name again?

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, NIGHT

The four are sitting at the table; SHAWN and GUS on one side, HENRY and NIGEL on the other. HENRY pauses eating when he sees NIGEL staring at him.

NIGEL:
Nose hair trimmer. Invest.

HENRY:
Can you even remember what it felt like to be able to move the muscles in your face?

NIGEL:
Who decorated this place? Kris Kristofferson?

GUS:
(looks over at a counter) Is that... Damn! (gets up from the table)

HENRY:
I built that table.

NIGEL:
Really? I'm pretty sure if I were to build a table, I would start by using wood that had never drifted.

HENRY:
All right, you know... (drops cutlery on plate) That's it.

NIGEL:
Already? I'm just getting started. I've got a sonnet for each piece of fish paraphernalia.

HENRY:
Oh, yeah? Well I got an ice-cold can of whip-ass just sitting in that fridge!

SHAWN:
Actually, that's diet whip-ass.

GUS returns and sits at the table with a plate of corn on the cob.

GUS:
Yeah!

SHAWN reaches for a cob and GUS slaps his hand away.

GUS:
You must be out of your damn mind!

SHAWN:
Dude, you have three full cobs!

GUS:
I will slap you, Shawn.

NIGEL:
Now, tell me... are you absolutely certain that this cow shoulder on my plate is in fact dead? I'm just asking.

HENRY:
That's it, take off the robe! (stands) Wearing that robe is a privilege and you, pal, have just lost it!

NIGEL:
I steadfastly refuse. This is the plushiest, most opulent robe I've ever had the pleasure of wearing.

HENRY:
Well, there's one thing we could agree on. Now give it up.

NIGEL:
No. I feel like an angel baby swaddled in a cocoon of cloud candy.

HENRY:
You either take it off, or I'll take it off for you.

SHAWN:
Dad, I don't think you're thinking this through.

HENRY:
Shawn! (points at SHAWN)

SHAWN:
Dad, I'm pretty sure he's going commando under...

SHAWN makes an attempt to grab a cob and GUS slaps his hand. SHAWN pulls his hand away with a cry.

GUS:
Keep playin', Shawn. Go ahead.

HENRY:
What kind of sick bastard goes commando underneath another man's robe?

NIGEL smiles smugly.

SHAWN:
(stands quickly) All right, all right. All right! (takes HENRY by the arm and leads hum from the room) Come with me. Come with me! Come on!

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN pushes HENRY into the room in front of the fireplace. They argue face-to-face.

SHAWN:
Dad, just walk it off.

HENRY:
(whispers) He's not staying here. He violated basic robe code.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Robe code violation, check.

HENRY:
(whispers) Look, Shawn, there's a reason this guy's on the run. He's been here ten minutes, even I want to kill him!

SHAWN:
(whispers) That's the problem, Dad. How do I protect him from everybody?

HENRY:
(whispers) You've already got a suspect in jail.

SHAWN:
(whispers) She was just released. Now we have a plethora of suspects and no way to narrow them down.

HENRY:
(whispers) It's easy, tighten your focus. Who does he victimize the most?

GUS:
(from doorway) Is that peach cobbler in the fridge for everybody?

INT. HOTEL, EMILINA'S BATHROOM, NIGHT

EMILINA enters the bathroom and walks over to the sink, putting her bag on the counter.

EMILINA:
(talks to herself) I'm sorry. Not today. I don't think so. I showed them! (sprays on perfume) It'll all go away. Mmm. It was funny. (sees a shadow in the shower reflected in the mirror) Nigel! (turns around and walks towards shower) Naughty! I hope you have some food in there.

The figure, clad in black, attacks EMILINA, pushing her into the counter. EMILINA pushes against the counter with her bare feet and the fall back into the shower. The assailant takes out a hypodermic needle and injects the contents into EMILINA.

INT. HOTEL, LOBBY, DAY

VICK is there with a number of officers along with SHAWN, GUS, NIGEL, ZAPATO and LESTER.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster, I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news. Emilina Saffron was found in the bathroom of her hotel suite this morning. She was clinging to life and has been rushed to St. Thomas of the Apostles. And so far all signs point to an overdose of some sort. But we are fully investigating the matter.

SHAWN:
Overdose?

VICK:
She injected herself with enough tranquilizers to kill an adult rhinoceros.

NIGEL:
But how did she escape?

VICK:
Mr. St. Nigel, Ms. Saffron was released this morning after her alibi checked out. She is the last person that you should be worried about now.

NIGEL:
We have to cancel the show.

LESTER:
Are you kidding? Look, I don't want to seem insensitive, but this is the third time this season she's been in the ICU.

NIGEL:
Not like this. I will not go on. I'll be a sitting duck out there.

VICK:
I will personally oversee your security detail, Mr. St. Nigel.

LESTER:
We'll all be out there together. You'll be just fine. Suck it up. (checks watch) Now I gotta bolt. I'm way late for my Pilates. (leaves)

ZAPATO walks over, puts a hand on NIGEL'S shoulder and sighs before leaving.

INT. HOTEL, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS make their way down the hall, backs against the wall.

GUS:
Lester Beacon sure didn't seem too broken up about Emilina.

SHAWN:
He sure didn't. Plus, his hair.

GUS:
Shawn, we're in a hallway, staying close to the wall doesn't make us invisible.

SHAWN:
(pauses) Agree to disagree. (continues)

GUS:
You have a plan yet?

SHAWN:
Gus, I'm a lyrical gangster. I'll use some colorful vernacular and if necessary, you'll engage in fisticuffs.

GUS:
Sshhh.

They pause and hear a whirring sound. They press themselves against the wall. An elderly man in a scooter chair goes past them down the hall. When he is gone, they relax, gasping.

SHAWN:
(panting) That was close.

GUS:
Too close.

They make their way down another hall and SHAWN stops outside a room.

SHAWN:
Ah. No guard.

GUS:
We did all that sneaking around because you thought they put a guard at Emilina's empty hotel room?

SHAWN:
Seemed like a decent theory at the time.

GUS:
You better have the key.

SHAWN pulls the key card from his shirt pocket.

INT. HOTEL, EMILINA'S BATHROOM, DAY

SHAWN switches on the lights.

GUS:
What are we looking for?

SHAWN:
Beats me. Damn. Seems clean.

GUS sighs and leaves the room. SHAWN switches off the lights. On the wall by the door he sees a reflected prism. He turns the lights on, it disappears. He turns them off again and it reappears. He looks around for the source and sees a light coming from the toilet. He walks over, kneels in front of it and looks inside where he sees a crystal pendant at the bottom. He remembers that BEVIN had one just like it on a chain around his neck. GUS walks by the door and sees SHAWN bending over the toilet.

GUS:
(enters) That's what you get for drinking whole milk, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Dude, I have bones like granite. (looks at GUS) And we just got ourselves a clue. (stands)

GUS:
What is it?

SHAWN:
I don't know. Reach in there and fish it out.

GUS:
I'm not putting my hand in there. You do it.

SHAWN:
Gus, I found it. You get it. That's how it works.

GUS:
I'm not putting my hand in Emilina Saffron's toilet water, Shawn.

SHAWN pulls out his phone and dials.

SHAWN:
Jules! I'm getting some really serious vibrations here. They're coming from Emilina's hotel room. You gotta get us in there as soon as possible. Oh, and, uh... Bring gloves.

>>> LATER >>>

They re-enter the room with JULIET.

SHAWN:
Oh, my God! It's just as I imagined. (puts his hands to his head) Oh, I am feeling something in here.

JULIET:
Right here?

SHAWN:
Did you bring the gloves?

JULIET:
Yeah, I brought the gloves. Why do I need gloves?

SHAWN:
I feel a sparkle. That! (points in the toilet)

JULIET looks into the toilet and sees the pendant.

JULIET:
Wow, Shawn, that's amazing. How did you know that?

SHAWN:
(exhales) I feel things. Deeply.

JULIET:
Yeah.

JULIET puts on the gloves and reaches into the water to get the pendant. He puts it in an evidence bag.

SHAWN:
I need to speak with Emilina right away.

JULIET:
She's mostly comatose, Shawn.

SHAWN:
We probably won't know the difference.

JULIET:
All right. (leaves)

GUS:
Dude!

GUS does a celebratory dance as SHAWN jumps in place.

SHAWN:
That crystal was on the...

GUS:
I know!

SHAWN:
Go back to the office, see if you can get some info on him.

GUS:
Okay.

They run from the room.

INT. HOSPITAL, EMILINA'S ROOM, DAY

EMILINA is lying unconscious on the bed. LASSITER is sitting in the chair at her bedside. JULIET and SHAWN enter the room through the collection of balloons at the doorway. SHAWN is carrying a pineapple with a pink bow on it.

JULIET:
Knock, knock! You have a visitor.

LASSITER:
(stands) What is Spencer doing here?

SHAWN:
Look, I insisted. Emilina's my favorite judge. (sets pineapple down) I used to have such a crush on her in high school. You know, before she started eating glue and whatnot. Has she said anything?

LASSITER:
No. Not yet. But I will be right here when she does. I can tell you that. (brushes hair from her face)

SHAWN:
That's... very gentle.

LASSITER:
I misjudged her. She was innocent. Crying out for help in her own sad, potentially disease-ridden way. I cut her off at the arms. Judged the book by its filthy, loathsome... wickedly erotic cover.

EMILINA opens her eyes.

EMILINA:
Look at me!

LASSITER:
(leans over) I'm here, baby.

EMILINA:
(slaps his face) Look... (points with two fingers) at me! (points back at her eyes)

SHAWN, JULIET and LASSITER look at EMILINA, waiting for more. EMILINA passes out.

SHAWN:
I think she's trying to tell us something.

JULIET:
That someone's looking at her?

LASSITER:
I was looking at her.

SHAWN'S cellphone rings and he reaches into his pocket to take it out. He reads the screen.

SHAWN:
I should take this. (steps out of the room)

INT. HOSPITAL, HALL, DAY

SHAWN stands by a religious statue.

SHAWN:
Yo!

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS is sitting at his desk in front of his laptop.

GUS:
Get ready to be happy, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Did you find him?

GUS:
I didn't just find him. I found him, found him, found him, and found him. (pulls up multiple videos of BEVIN trying out for American Duos) I knew this dude looked familiar. He's been at every stage of the competition, in every city, doing his best William Hung at every stop.

SHAWN:
Okay, let's try that again, and leave out the reference you know means nothing to me.

GUS:
He's singing badly on purpose, Shawn, knowing full well he wouldn't advance. That way he could re-enter the competition in every city at every stop.

SHAWN:
(nervously moves away from statue) That's nefarious.

GUS:
But he couldn't have done this on his own. Now we just have to figure out who's helping him from the inside.

SHAWN:
Emilina just said, "Look at me" from her hospital bed.

GUS:
How does that help us?

SHAWN:
Dude! (Spanish accent) "Look at me!"

GUS:
Wait a... (pulls up ZAPATO fan website and an old photo of ZAPATO and a fan) Ten-year-old Bevin Rennie Llywellen? What the... Oh, my God!

SHAWN:
What? What? We have a match?

INT. AMERICAN DUOS STAGE, DAY

CHANCE and RANCE are onstage singing "The Yellow Rose of Texas" as they alternate bobbing up and down.

INT. AMERICAN DUOS, BACKSTAGE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS try to sneak around backstage but knock over a table of paint cans that clatter and roll across the stage, interrupting the brothers. SHAWN and GUS make their way onto the stage. VICK shakes her head.

GUS:
Please, accept our apologies. We just thought you all might want to know that you're in the presence of a homicidal sociopath!

CHANCE:
No, no, no! He's not crazy. No, we got a doctor's note and everything.

SHAWN:
(looks over to the panel and NIGEL is missing) Nigel!

NIGEL:
(gets up from under the table) Just, um... dropped some... items.

SHAWN:
Chief. So glad you're here. I know who's been trying to kill Nigel. (walks across the stage and the spotlight follows)

GUS walks after SHAWN to stay in the spotlight.

GUS:
And who was trying to take out Emilina.

SHAWN:
And who tried to take out Emilina.

NIGEL:
Mr. Spencer, last time I checked, Emilina overdosed on her own prescription medication.

SHAWN:
That's precisely what Bevin Rennie Llywellen wanted you to think.

SHAWN walks closer to the table and GUS follows again.

VICK:
That's really his name?

NIGEL:
That's the wanker who auditioned in every city.

SHAWN:
Just another slice of deception. The truth is, he can sing like a bird, but if you heard that, he wouldn't have to re-audition in every city on the tour. Every city that you almost died in, Nigel. And after Emilina was released, he tried to silence her for good before she could put it all together.

The scene flashes to BEVIN going through EMILINA'S purse as she slept on the car. All she could see was a fuzzy picture on a T-shirt.

NIGEL:
Put what together?

VICK squints against the lights as JULIET and LASSITER bring BEVIN down to the stage in handcuffs.

VICK:
And who might this be, Detectives?

JULIET:
Meet Bevin Rennie Llywellen.

LASSITER:
Ms. Saffron woke up out of her coma, rabbit-punched me in the sternum, and remembered this guy as one of her assailants.

JULIET:
(holds up evidence bag) This crystal puts him at the scene of the crime.

VICK:
So he made an attempt on Emilina's life, allegedly poisoned a tuna salad sandwich...

LASSITER:
Uh, tuna ni√ßoise salad sandwich, Chief. There's a difference.

VICK:
But what about all the other near misses with Nigel?

NIGEL:
But it can't be him. It's impossible. He was just a contestant.

SHAWN raises his hand to his head about to speak, but GUS speaks first.

GUS:
Sounds like he had somebody on the inside.

SHAWN:
(smacks GUS on the chest) He had somebody on the inside, didn't he, Zapato!

Flash again to BEVIN going through EMILINA'S purse and the picture on the shirt is ZAPATO with the word "Mirame" and "Look at Me" underneath.

NIGEL:
(laughs) Don't be ridiculous. Zapato adores me. Plus he can't even think. Oh, it has to be someone else. Um, how about Lester? Oh, I'd love to see him in prison.

SHAWN:
Bevin is Zapato's biggest fan. They actually became pretty good friends. And I don't think this show turned out to be quite the comeback either of them were hoping for. I could go on. But why don't you take the floor, Zapato?

As SHAWN speaks we see BEVIN drop the light, poison the sandwich, set the explosives in the microwave and rig the electrics at NIGEL'S trailer. ZAPATO was the one to drug EMILINA.

NIGEL:
Well, what could he say? He can't even speak.

ZAPATO:
(stands) Yes, I can! But you don't let me. I was the first to sign on. This was supposed to be my show! My shot, my comeback!

SHAWN and GUS fist-bump

ZAPATO:
You turned me into a simp! I freakin' hate you! People don't even know who I am. I get fan letters addressed to Geraldo, Ricky Martin, and that guy from El Pollo Loco commercial!

SHAWN claps and looks at GUS as if it had been driving them crazy as to who he reminded them of.

ZAPATO:
You ruined everything! Why won't you die?

ZAPATO lunges as NIGEL to strangle him but is pulled off by two officers. NIGEL sits there calmly and begins to critique ZAPATO as an assassin.

NIGEL:
Really? That was your plan? That has to be the poorest-executed attack in history. I was two feet away from you all the time. I mean, you have to be absolutely, without doubt, the worst murderer I have ever seen.

Grunting, ZAPATO makes another lunge but is held back by the police.

NIGEL:
Would you get... Would you look... (sings) Mirame.

ZAPATO screams as he is held and NIGEL mimics him.

>>> LATER >>>

American Duos is ready to go live!

LESTER:
Are you ready, Santa Barbara, for the next two contestants on American Duos?

SHAWN and GUS get to re-visit their childhood. SHAWN, dressed as Roland Orzabal, begins to sing "Shout" by Tears for Fears. GUS enters as Michael Jackson in the red leather outfit and the one studded glove. He throws his microphone off to the side past JULIET who does the dance moves with him. GUS does moves from "Thriller" as well as moonwalk. They both end with the robot. The crowd cheers and gives a standing ovation.

LESTER:
All right, give it up for Shawn Spence Starr and Gus TT Showbizz! Great job, gentlemen. Now let's see what our judge thought. Come on over.

LESTER walks them over to NIGEL, the only judge remaining. NIGEL turns to the crowd and raises an eyebrow and the audience quiets.

NIGEL:
Sit.

The audience sits and NIGEL turns his attention to SHAWN and GUS.

NIGEL:
What, are you kidding me? You look like a couple of rodeo clowns up there. Nothing was in synch. Your hairstyles are ridiculous. You butchered a terrific song, and it's time you went home. Please, spare us additional torture and just... euthanize yourselves.

The crowd boos and SHAWN and GUS walk off the stage defiantly, making faces at NIGEL. SHAWN backs into a mic stand and knocks it over and GUS trips.

Episode 2x02 65 Million Years Off

1987

INT. SCHOOL HALL, DAY

We see GUS walking down the hall wearing a giant Tyrannosaurus Rex head. A couple of girls run up trying to figure out who is inside.

GIRL:
Who's on there?

GIRL 2:
What is it?

GIRL 3:
Oh, cool!

GUS:
Please don't touch it. Excuse me.

INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM, DAY

As GUS walks into the classroom, we see a banner proclaiming it "Stone Age Day". Through the mouth (GUS' POV) we see SHAWN run up.

SHAWN:
Gus, Gus, Gus!

GUS:
Where's your project, Shawn? Did you even do it?

SHAWN:
My project? Of course I did it.

GUS:
Uh-huh, when?

SHAWN:
When? Last night. It's right here.

SHAWN holds up a toy T-Rex glued to a remote-control car.

GUS:
This head is to exact scale. It took me three months to make it. Yours took five minutes.

SHAWN:
No, Gus, you're totally wrong. It took me a whole hour. Check this out.

SHAWN sets the car on the floor and races it past the amazed children until it runs into the teacher's shoe. She picks it up and gives the OK sign as the kids applaud.

GUS:
I hate you, Shawn.

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER is sitting across from a suspect, just staring at him. The MAN fidgets nervously. LASSITER finally speaks.

LASSITER:
Lompoc.

MAN:
Okay, I did it.

LASSITER looks smugly at the observation room.

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, DAY

Inside the room, a crowd cheers and applauds.

JULIET:
That's seven in row.

BUZZ:
Eight. The gas station guy confessed last week!

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER is being "modest" when accepting praise from his peers. BUZZ adds the latest case to a large dry-erase board keeping track of the cases.

LASSITER:
Oh, I wouldn't call myself a hero. I'm just doing my job just like all of you. Hey, that's enough goofing off. Let's get back to work, huh? You too.

BUZZ:
Ladies and gentlemen, Detective Lassiter!

BUZZ starts another round of applause.

LASSITER:
Oh, stop it!

The police move away from the board and we see SHAWN leaning against the wall in the archway. He is not happy with the attention LASSITER is getting. JULIET comes up the stairs and SHAWN sees her and walks over.

SHAWN:
Jules!

JULIET:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
Is there a problem?

JULIET:
With what?

SHAWN:
With you. With me. With the Chief. She hasn't called in a month. Is she still mad about me requisitioning the Segway?

JULIET:
You did that?

SHAWN:
No.

JULIET:
Well, I don't really have time right now, but the short answer is we just haven't really needed any outside help.

JULIET walks down the hall to the bullpen and SHAWN follows.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET stands behind her desk while SHAWN stands in front.

SHAWN:
Well, what's the long answer? I mean, throw a "but" in there and add something about a dream where you and I got thrown out of a mattress showroom.

JULIET:
Detective Lassiter is literally on fire.

SHAWN:
What kind of fire are we talking about? Michael-Jackson-in the-Pepsi-commercial fire or misusing-the-word-"literally" fire?

JULIET:
He's-solved-eight-cases-in-a-row fire.

BUZZ:
Nine. I just remembered the DeShano case. (walks over) Hey, Shawn. What's new? You still doing the psychic thing? (leaves)

SHAWN:
Is this some sort of weird dream?

JULIET:
On the last two cases, the first suspect Lassiter questioned confessed. It's really magnificent.

SHAWN:
We are talking about Carlton Lassiter, right? Yea high? Bats ninth for the department softball team?

JULIET:
Tenth. We play with a rover.

LASSITER strides over.

LASSITER:
Spencer, long time, no see. Or is that "no need"?

SHAWN:
I can't believe this.

LASSITER:
Oh, believe it. It's real.

BUZZ walks up behind LASSITER.

BUZZ:
They've done a preliminary on the body down at the marina, Detective. They're ready for you at the scene.

LASSITER:
Well, I would love to stay and chat, but duty does call. Oh, Spencer, you look so sad. Come on, we'll show you how real cops do it.

LASSITER walks away and JULIET makes to follow after picking up some files. She stops and turns to SHAWN.

JULIET:
No comeback? Shawn, that's slightly embarrassing. (walks away)

SHAWN:
Where'd you get that... suit? The toilet store?

EXT. MARINA, DAY

SHAWN walks down onto the beach to stand behind LASSITER, JULIET and VICK as they look at the body under the pier. He notices the victim is wearing work boots.

VICK:
Good luck with this one, Detective. There's no identification. Nobody's been reported missing fitting this description. (sees SHAWN) Oh, Mr. Spencer. I'm surprised you didn't take the Segway.

SHAWN:
(softly to JULIET) She did know about that.

VICK:
O'Hara just told me.

SHAWN:
Traitor.

VICK:
I'll deal with you later.

The detectives duck under the police tape. SHAWN takes LASSITER'S notes before the man leaves. GUS joins him as he reads the notes. There is a possible animal bite with a 34-inch radius.

GUS:
So what's the new case we've got?

SHAWN:
A slight error in grammar there, buddy.

GUS:
Which part?

SHAWN:
"Got".

Under the dock, LASSITER realizes his notes are missing and sees them in SHAWN'S hands.

GUS:
I came all the way down from the office, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Gus, don't be a giant snapping turtle. We'll have a case in five minutes.

LASSITER walks over and snatches his notes out of SHAWN'S hands. SHAWN and GUS duck under the tape and follow him over to the body.

VICK:
Nobody can explain these puncture wounds. We can't rule out an animal attack.

SHAWN sees the bite marks across the torso.

LASSITER:
No. No, there's nothing in these waters with a bite radius that large. No, this is maybe a boating accident. The wounds caused by some machinery. I can't really be sure at this juncture.

SHAWN:
Completely stumped. Hmm.

VICK:
You getting something, Mr. Spencer?

SHAWN:
Yes. Yes, I am. (takes a pad and pen from LASSITER and starts drawing)

LASSITER:
No, no, no! No, hold on. Okay, I've got it. The wound on the head was caused by the edge of a boat when he fell in the water unconscious. And the wounds on the back, they were caused by a large industrial crab trap. (motions the trap closing with his hands) Or a whale. It definitely could've been a whale. I mean, lost from his pod, separated, migrating north or south, and sees our man dead, already floating up above the surface. Thinks it's a seal and then... (motions a bite with his hands) whale.

JULIET has been writing notes as LASSITER was speaking.

GUS:
A whale?

JULIET:
What's your guy got?

GUS:
Watch and learn, Jules. Watch and learn.

LASSITER:
Or...

VICK:
Detective, if you don't mind, I'd like to see what Mr. Spencer has to offer.

SHAWN:
All right, look, this is gonna be a little rough, okay? I didn't have time for shading, there's no forced perspective. If I had really had my druthers, I would've done it in charcoal. (points to GUS) You know what I'm talking about. Look, what I'm trying to say is, I'm not the artist I'd like to be...

VICK:
Okay, Mr. Spencer, enough. Can you or can you not tell us who's responsible for this man's death?

SHAWN:
If I can present you with a semi-accurate sketch of the culprit, is that enough to get us on this case?

VICK:
Yes.

SHAWN:
All right. The puncture wounds. They're the key. Giving me the impression that this crime could only have been committed... (flips the pad over and shows VICK and LASSITER) by this guy. (shows GUS and JULIET) This guy here.

We see he has drawn the head of a T-Rex. Everyone looks at him, disbelieving. LASSITER smiles and puts on his sunglasses before taking back his pen and paper.

LASSITER:
Excuse me. (leaves)

SHAWN:
What? (VICK and JULIET leave) Chief, where are you off to? So what, that's a no? (GUS leaves) Gus! (looks down at body) This is not a boating accident.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN follows GUS inside.

SHAWN:
You're mad.

GUS:
No, I'm not mad. I'm happy. I'm thrilled. I love looking like an idiot.

SHAWN:
Well, that explains your shoes.

They go to their respective desks. SHAWN pulls out a storage box and begins to go through it.

GUS:
You almost closed down our agency with that little act of yours, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Me? You're the one spending all your extra time at your little "side project".

GUS:
(walks over in front of SHAWN'S desk) You mean my real job? Soon to be my only job?

SHAWN:
Gus, you're panicking. Don't panic. Those bite marks are consistent with a tyrannosaurus bite.

GUS:
You know that.

SHAWN:
Yes, I know that. The hard way. (shows GUS a photo of himself in the mouth of a T-Rex reconstruction) I was canned from the Wyoming Natural History Museum for that little shot. The bruises from the teeth didn't go away for a year, but totally worth it. It was my best screensaver ever. (GUS throws the photo back at him and walks to his desk) Gus, please, connecting a dinosaur to this case is the least of our worries. Look, I can I stash a toy dinosaur in the window of the killer. I can link him to a box of Dino Bites or Fruity Pebbles. I can play Six Degrees of Dinosaur with you right now. You've never been in a movie with Kevin Bacon or a Dilaposaurus, have you?

GUS:
How about you play Six Degrees of Kiss My Ass?

SHAWN:
First of all, that sounds like a totally disturbing game. What's weird is that my guess on the jaw radius was actually spot on. It almost seems to make sense. (sits)

GUS:
So now you're getting on board with your own joke theory? How are you gonna match your bite radius to the victim, Shawn? Drag the body to the Wyoming museum?

SHAWN:
Hmm. (stands) I can do you one better.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I need to borrow my dad's truck. (stops at the door) You coming or what? (the squeaky frog lands on his head) That's clearly a no.

INT. MORGUE, EXAM ROOM, DAY

The CORONER is speaking with VICK, LASSITER and JULIET. JULIET is taking notes.

CORONER:
The one thing we can be sure of is the cause of death was not drowning. Blunt force trauma to the head was severe enough to knock him unconscious. More than likely he fell from some sort of a platform after knocking himself on the head.

JULIET:
And this is how he ended up in the water?

CORONER:
No, he landed on something hard. Dislocated a rib. He has bruises consistent with a six, seven, or eight-foot fall. My guess is that he landed on something else and ultimately expired before tumbling into the water.

LASSITER:
You know, this might be a leap, but why don't we check the offshore oil rigs? See if any of them are missing workers.

JULIET sees something outside the room, but answers LASSITER.

JULIET:
I'll make some calls.

Through the windows of the doors, we see GUS' dinosaur head making its way down the hall. The others have their backs to it and don't see.

VICK:
Interesting, Detective.

LASSITER:
Thanks, Chief. This theory feels good. Just makes sense. The work boots, the odd configuration of the wounds. You know us, Ted. It's worth a shot, right? We don't go out on limbs too often...

Two officers open the doors.

SHAWN:
Thanks, guys. I just need to measure something. (opens the mouth) Oh, good! You're all here. Get ready to be shocked. Can we get the sheet off the dead guy, please? Confirming the bite radius...

SHAWN'S POV through the T-Rex mouth as he walks forward. VICK holds her hand out in front of him.

VICK:
No! Mr. Spencer. (takes hold of the head)

SHAWN:
Whoa, hey, hey, be careful. This isn't mine.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, your antics have always been a little, let's say, unorthodox. But let me be as frank as I can be with my assessment of your most recent behavior. Seek help.

SHAWN:
Chief, sometimes you have to jump off a cliff. You have to close your eyes. You have to unhook your clip "chasses"... Chassis? Climbing thing. And you have to leap. Now I ask you, Chief, will you leap with me?

VICK:
Are you thinking about jumping off a cliff?

SHAWN:
Maybe.

SHAWN snaps the model mouth closed and exits as the officers hold the doors open.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN opens the door and knocks.

SHAWN:
Yo! Dad? (closes the door and crosses the room) I've brought the keys back. Hello!

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN walks into the kitchen to see HENRY and GUS. GUS is sitting at the table eating a cupcake.

SHAWN:
Okay, this is creepy. Why is Gus here?

HENRY:
Why do you think, Shawn?

SHAWN:
He's a hostage.

A MAN in a suit walks over from the sink area.

MAN:
Perhaps I can shed some light on that.

SHAWN:
Two hostages.

HENRY:
Doug Devette is an old colleague of mine from the force. The Chief asked me to have him drop by.

SHAWN:
(tosses the keys on the table) Why?

HENRY:
Doug is the department psychologist, Shawn.

SHAWN:
What is this, some sort of intervention?

HENRY:
Yeah, sort of.

DOUG:
We don't like to use the term "intervention," Shawn.

SHAWN:
(looks at GUS) Gus?

GUS:
Don't look at me. I'm here for the cupcakes.

SHAWN:
Dad, I am not on drugs.

DOUG:
Oh, nobody thinks that, Shawn.

HENRY:
Well, I'm not completely sure about that, Doug.

DOUG:
We're all just a little concerned that you might be stretching yourself a bit too thin.

HENRY:
It wasn't my idea, but he's right, Shawn. You're acting like a nut job.

SHAWN:
Just because I take Gus' giant dinosaur head down to a dead body does not make me a nut job.

GUS:
What? (gets up and looks out the window to see the head in the back of HENRY'S truck) You took my T-Rex? My mom gave it to you?

SHAWN:
Gladly. She also gave me some pictures you can pay me to not show your next girlfriend.

GUS:
What pictures?

SHAWN:
The ones that document your Terence Trent D'Arby phase.

GUS:
Whatever, Shawn. You took Danny Dino to the police station?

SHAWN:
No. Gus, give me some credit. I took him to the morgue. Good news. Your specifications were spot on.

GUS glares at SHAWN before sitting back at the table to finish his cupcake.

DOUG:
Your father tells me you have delusions of magical powers.

SHAWN:
Delusions? Really? Doug, I'm employed as a psychic. I've solved 18 cases this year. I have business cards and a personalized coffee mug that backs up the whole thing. I feel things about people. (sees DOUG is wearing different colored socks) You, for instance, are color blind. That's nothing to be ashamed off. (sees bitten fingernails) You're also really stressed about something. (sees university pamphlets) College. It can be very expensive, Doug.

DOUG:
(turns to HENRY) Oh, that was good, Henry.

HENRY:
Doug, do not be a stooge.

DOUG:
Not a stooge, but in this one case, he was right.

SHAWN sees a shadow at the window of the kitchen door and puts a hand to his head.

SHAWN:
Knock at door.

There is a knock on the door and VICK and LASSITER let themselves in.

HENRY:
(walks over) Karen, do you mind? We're in the middle of an intervention here.

VICK:
We don't have time for that.

HENRY:
But you're the one who asked for this!

VICK:
And I thank you, Henry, but I'm afraid that this can't wait. We just got a break in the case. (turns to SHAWN) We just found out the name of the dead man. You want to tell him who he is, Detective?

LASSITER:
No.

VICK:
His name was Christopher Franzen. He is a paleontologist.

They look to SHAWN and he turns to GUS and then everyone turns to GUS.

GUS:
A dinosaur hunter.

SHAWN:
(looks at VICK) As expected. Doug, pleasure was all mine. (shakes DOUG'S hand)

DOUG:
Oh, no, Shawn, mine.

SHAWN:
We should get together.

EXT. UNIVERSITY, PALENTOLOGY BUILDING, DAY

GUS and SHAWN get out of the car and walk towards the building.

GUS:
All right, here's what we know so far. A man, a paleontology professor, washes ashore with wounds specific to a dinosaur. I don't think we can rule out the possibility of island somewhere in the Pacific where dinosaurs do exist.

SHAWN:
And have an appetite for Jeff Goldblum.

GUS:
I'm being serious, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Well, look who's Mr. Onboard and sounding like a whacked wombat.

GUS:
Then what is it?

SHAWN:
I don't know. It actually scares me that my wild dinosaur reach landed so close to the bull's-eye. This guy was possibly killed by something dinosaur-related, but it was probably a model or something from the archaeology department. We'll have to spend the better part of the next 24 hours sifting through their entire collection of artifacts. And by "we" I mean mostly you.

INT. ARCHEOLOGY DEPARTMENT, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are bending over looking at a sparse collection of mid-size bones and teeth. A young grad student, ETHAN, is showing them around.

SHAWN:
This is all there is?

ETHAN:
No. No, no, no, no. This is just the big stuff. We got the trilobites in a shoe box, but the shelf is kind of high.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You've got Pinhead, Chatterbox, Surgeon, and Stitch up there on a shelf?

GUS:
Shawn, those are Cenobites.

SHAWN:
Huh, well, what are trilobites?

GUS:
Fish fossils.

SHAWN:
Oh, Gus, for my sake, at least pretend like you don't know this stuff off the top of your head. Do this move. (holds hand to head) Trilo... trilobite? (GUS jabs him with his elbow) What? It'll help you! I'm serious. Look, Ethan, I can honestly say there were more historically significant items in the lost and found at the Taco John's in Porterville.

ETHAN:
Yeah. Yeah, it's a little sad. Word is the whole program is going under.

GUS:
You sure about that?

ETHAN:
Look, Professor Franzen would never really give us a straight answer. In fact, most nights he wasn't around to give us any answers. He was a pretty crappy advisor. And when he did show up, he was late, tired, completely disheveled. Nobody really trusted the guy. Look, do not ever take a class from him.

SHAWN:
He's dead.

ETHAN:
Oh, yeah. Then totally. (leaves)

GUS:
Well, this sure was a dead end.

SHAWN:
Yep, but at least we were the first ones to find the dead end. (looks out the window and sees LASSITER and JULIET) Oh, come on! He really is on fire. Literally.

SHAWN and GUS leave the room.

EXT. FRANZEN HOUSE, DAY

The police are already at the house when GUS and SHAWN arrive.

GUS:
I don't get this. The cops beat us to the dead guy's house.

SHAWN:
I don't know how I feel about the police department being so proactive.

GUS:
Feeling the heat?

SHAWN:
What, do you think I'm afraid of a little competition?

GUS:
I know you're afraid of competition. Why else would you have purposefully broken the Battlezone at Pizza Royale?

SHAWN:
Dude, you beat me once. And only because you first used the eye piece and then revealed you had pinkeye. (sees a keypad lock on the garage) Let's venture off the beaten path.

They head down the overgrown drive to the garage. SHAWN stops.

GUS:
What's wrong?

SHAWN:
I'm just trying to figure out what to do here, since as a rule we don't break and enter.

GUS:
What do you mean we don't break and enter? The 2400 Motel, the Hotel de la Cruz, the spellmaster's box.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but we really shouldn't pick this lock.

GUS:
You know I want to pick that lock.

SHAWN:
Yes, I do.

GUS:
Watch out.

SHAWN leans against the door as GUS strokes the keypad.

SHAWN:
What are you, the lock whisperer?

GUS lets out high-pitched gasps.

SHAWN:
Are you channeling Michael Jackson?

GUS shushes him and presses another button. There is an audible click.

GUS:
Who heard the second click?

SHAWN:
I heard the second click.

GUS presses the last button and pulls back as there is another click.

SHAWN:
Really?

SHAWN grunts as he pushes the door.

GUS:
Come on!

SHAWN slides the door open and slips into the garage. GUS looks around before entering and closing the door behind him.

INT. FRANZEN GARAGE, DAY

With the little light coming through the windows, we can see shelves and boxes strewn about the place.

SHAWN:
I can't see anything.

GUS:
Oh, I got it, I got it.

GUS reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small flashlight. He turns it on and looks around. He accidentally shines it in SHAWN'S eyes.

SHAWN:
Gus, that thing is brighter than the sun. I think you just gave me glaucoma.

GUS:
You can't give someone glaucoma. (finds light switch and turns it on)

SHAWN:
Thank you.

They look around and see a large number of fossils, larger than the ones at the university.

GUS:
This is better than the entire university department.

SHAWN:
It sure is.

GUS:
And his digging equipment is some heavy duty stuff. Looks like some shovels are missing. Part of a portable light kit. A lot of brushes. And fine finishing equipment, which I would assume he was only using in the lab.

As GUS is talking, SHAWN looks around and finds a photo of FRANZEN standing in front of a mounted fossil. He also finds a folded piece of paper with Xs and Os marked on it.

SHAWN:
Dude, I got something.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(holds up paper) He was the worst tic-tac-toe player in the history of the world.

GUS:
I'm investigating and you're analyzing his doodles?

SHAWN:
Doodles are the window to the soul, Gus. Or maybe that's the epiglottis. Where's the uvula?

GUS looks out the door and sees LASSITER and JULIET getting out of a car.

GUS:
Lassiter's here.

SHAWN:
That guy's like five minutes behind us everywhere we go. (hides the diagram) Don't sleep in the nude tonight.

They leave the garage and turn out the lights.

EXT. FRANZEN HOUSE, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET make their way to the garage and LASSITER tries the door. SHAWN and GUS come around the corner like they were just arriving.

LASSITER:
Spencer, enjoying your time riding my behind?

SHAWN:
Definitely not in the nude.

LASSITER:
This lock looks too high tech for a backyard shed. We gotta find somebody who can crack the code.

SHAWN:
There's already someone here who can do that. (GUS makes a step forward but SHAWN puts up a hand) That person... is me.

LASSITER:
Well, make yourself useful.

SHAWN rubs his hands together and approaches the lock.

SHAWN:
I'll need you to step back, please. Give me some room to operate. (LASSITER and JULIET take a couple steps back) Further, please. (another couple steps) Further. Jules, could you help me out here? Just get him back onto the cobblestone. That's good, that's good. (they step back past the side of the garage) Thank you. I am sensing the first two digits. (whispers to GUS) What is it, 31? (GUS scoffs) Gus, help me out here. Come on, buddy. You can have my Tony Gwynn rookie.

GUS:
25.

SHAWN:
(loudly) 25!  (punches keys)(to GUS) Eight?

GUS:
Three.

SHAWN:
Three! Four?

GUS:
Two.

SHAWN:
And... two.

GUS:
There's one more.

SHAWN:
Wait! There's one more.

GUS:
Nine.

SHAWN presses the final button and slides the door open. JULIET and LASSITER walk over.

JULIET:
That was amazing. (walks into the garage)

LASSITER:
I'll give you that one. (enters the garage)

GUS pushes SHAWN into the garage door before heading inside.

INT. FRANZEN GARAGE, DAY

LASSITER:
Can't see a thing in here.

GUS:
Oh, I've got it. (reaches for flashlight)

SHAWN:
Wait, I'm sensing a light switch. (turns on lights)

GUS shines the flashlight in SHAWN'S eyes and SHAWN bats him away.

LASSITER:
Tools are missing.

SHAWN:
Good work, Detective.

JULIET:
He had a blunt force trauma. That could be supplied by one of these missing items.

LASSITER:
Maybe this rock hammer or this medium shovel.

JULIET:
But where would they be?

LASSITER:
The bed of his pickup. It wasn't parked out front or at the university. We find that truck, we find the murder weapon. Let's go, O'Hara. We're burning daylight. Excuse us.

LASSITER and JULIET leave.

SHAWN:
Man, you missed the truck?

GUS:
I'm not the psychic.

SHAWN heads for the door but stops when he sees a box from a road-side fruit stand in Ojai.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Why would someone frequent a fruit stand that's over 50 miles away?

GUS:
They like pomegranate?

SHAWN and GUS leave the garage.

EXT. PRODUCE STAND, DAY

SHAWN shows the OWNER the photo of FRANZEN.

OWNER:
Yeah, I know him. He was my best customer. Don't know his name. But he comes by every night before closing. (gives photo back)

GUS:
Did you ever see which way he went?

OWNER:
Yeah. (points) Always up the hill. That's all I see. Although every once in a while I see him come back down the hill early in the morning.

SHAWN:
Hmm. Well, thank you very much. Gus, you got anything else?

GUS:
Yes, is that peach pie in the back?

OWNER:
Yeah.

EXT. DIRT ROAD, DAY

GUS drives the Echo along the road through a dandelion-dotted field and past a distressed sign that reads "Deacon Walker Farms - No Trespassing". GUS stops the car when a gate blocks the road.

INT. ECHO, DAY

GUS:
Another dead end. Let's turn around.

SHAWN sees that the bolt above the gate isn't as rusted as the other bits of hardware.

SHAWN:
Hold on a second.

SHAWN and GUS get out of the car.

EXT. DIRT ROAD, DAY

SHAWN walks over to the post and points at the bolt.

SHAWN:
This looks like a place someone's been sneaking into.

SHAWN tries to lift the gate and GUS helps him. They slip through the space created.

EXT. FIELD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS cross the fields.

SHAWN:
What is this?

GUS:
Looks like some kind of farmland or grazing plain.

SHAWN:
Oh, look at that. It's like that movie. The one with Sigourney Weaver.

Ahead of them in the field are recent signs of digging, hastily filled-in holes.

GUS:
Aliens?

SHAWN:
No.

GUS:
Alien.

SHAWN:
No.

GUS:
Alien: Resurrection.

SHAWN:
Gus, the one with the holes and Shia LaBeouf.

GUS:
They had holes in Shia LaBeouf?

SHAWN:
The holes are in the ground, dude, like that. And Jon Voight was walking around all crazy.

GUS:
(slaps SHAWN on the arm) Oh, Anaconda.

SHAWN:
Yeah, never mind. (walks ahead)

GUS:
(follows) Gorillas in the Mist? Death and the Maiden?

SHAWN:
No!

GUS:
Half Moon Street?

SHAWN:
Just let it go.

They stop in the middle of the field.

SHAWN:
I'll be damned.

A gun is fired.

GUS:
(ducks) What?! Somebody's shooting at us!

They both scream and start running back to the car.

SHAWN:
Oh, God! They're shooting at us!

GUS:
We're gonna die!

SHAWN:
For sure! Run, Gus! Gus, run like the wind! No... get... get up!

EXT. DIRT ROAD, DAY

They slip through the gap between the gate and post.

GUS:
Okay!

SHAWN:
Hold the door.

GUS:
Come on, get in the car! (gets in car) Hurry up, Shawn!

SHAWN:
(gets in car) Start it, start it! Go, go, go!

GUS sets the Echo in reverse.

INT. ECHO, DAY

GUS ducks down and looks out the rear window as he drives.

SHAWN:
Dude, look at the road while you're driving!

GUS:
I'm staying down for safety.

SHAWN:
He was shooting directly into the air, Gus.

GUS:
Bullets go up. They have to come down.

SHAWN:
Do you know what the trajectory would have to be for that to happen?

GUS:
Don't you dare argue physics with me. Not while we're in the process of almost being killed.

GUS turns the car around. He sees a sign that reads: Trespassers Will Be Shot - Private Property.

GUS:
Didn't you see the "Trespassers Will Be Shot" sign?

SHAWN:
(looks out window) Oh, yeah. It totally said that. My bad.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK, SHAWN and GUS are the only ones in the office.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, if you have any substantial information concerning the Christopher Franzen case, please get on with it.

SHAWN:
(clucks) I've got something. It's a cluck.

VICK:
A cluck?

SHAWN:
(clucks) Actually there's two.

VICK:
Two clucks.

SHAWN:
A cluck-cluck here. (walks like a chicken towards GUS) A bawk-bawk there. (walks to the door) Here a bawk. (points to another area) There a...

VICK:
Cluck?

SHAWN:
Everywhere a bawk-baaawk.

VICK:
Let me guess. You have a name. MacDonald, perhaps?

SHAWN:
No. No, it's a farm. With a farmer. An old farmer. Farmer Shootypants. That's a nickname. I don't think that's his actual handle.

LASSITER and JULIET enter the room.

LASSITER:
I've got it!

JULIET:
Lassiter found the paleontologist's truck.

LASSITER:
You helped.

JULIET:
I did help. It was his hunch.

LASSITER:
It was down at the old marina. I just had a feeling. I also found the prints of a certain grad student named Ethan Robinson along with a stack of letters from said grad students demanding the professor stop ruining his life.

JULIET:
We're sending a car over to pick him up.

LASSITER:
(sees SHAWN'S stunned face) Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting your trance?

SHAWN:
(to VICK) I don't buy it.

LASSITER:
Which part? The damning evidence or the murder weapon?

SHAWN:
There's more going on in this guy's life. Chief, I'm sensing... (mimes the act) Digging.

LASSITER:
Yeah, the archaeology department was going under. He was trying to make a big discovery. Put him on the map, get more funding.

SHAWN:
The farm. I can see the name of the farm. It's Wallll... Wall...

LASSITER:
Walker Farms. Yeah, we got that lead off the phone records. Yesterday. Apparently our victim made a series of phone calls to the farmer trying to buy some of his land, but it wasn't for sale.

JULIET:
Farmer was forthcoming, cooperative...

LASSITER:
Definitely not a suspect. (looks at SHAWN) Anything else?

VICK:
I have to say, you have been very thorough.

LASSITER:
We're just doing what any good cops would do.

LASSITER and JULIET fist-bump. SHAWN gasps.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

HENRY is in a chair reading, feet up on the coffee table when SHAWN and GUS enter.

HENRY:
Shawn, what are you doing?

GUS:
Yeah, what are we doing, Shawn?

SHAWN:
I need to borrow some tools.

HENRY:
What kind of tools?

SHAWN:
Digging tools. A little excavation project we got going on.

HENRY:
Are you still on that dinosaur thing?

GUS:
We're still on that dinosaur thing?

SHAWN:
What, is there an echo in here? Yes, we're still on the dinosaur thing. We step foot on the far end of this guy Walker's farm in Ojai and he starts blasting us with buckshot. We know our dead guy was there every night leading up to his death, digging around the periphery of this property. (heads for the kitchen)

HENRY:
(gets up and walks over to SHAWN) No, Shawn, wait. I don't want you borrowing my tools.

SHAWN:
Oh, Gus will leave his class ring as collateral.

GUS:
No, I won't.

SHAWN:
Yes, you will.

GUS:
No, I won't.

SHAWN:
Sure you will.

GUS:
No, I won't.

HENRY:
I can't support this.

SHAWN:
Well, there's a shocker, you not being supportive.

HENRY:
Would you shut up and listen? I'm saying I can't support you going somewhere where you could get shot.

SHAWN:
What, are you... Are you worried about me?

HENRY:
Shawn, I've been worried about you since you were three years old and started eating your own toenails.

SHAWN:
Well, Dad, I'll be fine, okay? We're not gonna go anywhere near the house. And if it'll make you feel any better, I will stand behind Gus the entire time.

GUS:
No, you won't.

SHAWN:
Yes, I will.

GUS:
No, you won't.

SHAWN:
Oh, yes, I will.

GUS:
You wanna bet?

HENRY:
I don't like it. It doesn't feel right. I know feelings.

SHAWN:
Pardon me? Did... Did you just say..."I know feelings"?

SHAWN pats HENRY on the shoulder as he walks past. GUS follows him.

EXT. FIELD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stand on the edge of the field. SHAWN has a bag with HENRY'S tools over his shoulder.

GUS:
Perfect. This will be easy.

SHAWN:
Oh, there's a pattern here. Those guys dig with a reason.

GUS:
How do you know that?

SHAWN:
Gus, I worked at the museum for almost an entire weekend before I got canned. (flashes on the map from FRANZEN'S garage) Wait a second. Those weren't tic-tac-toe boards. Those were all the places he'd dug.

GUS:
There were like 25 Xs. No way he scored that often.

SHAWN:
The Xs were misses. In this case, "O" marks the spot. (closes eyes and overlays the map on the field and points) And that's the "O." (walks over and sees tracks) This is the only hole filled by a bulldozer.

GUS:
No self-respecting paleontologist would use a bulldozer. (scoffs and puts hands on hips)

SHAWN:
Why do you know that?

GUS:
Because, Shawn, if you use a bull...

SHAWN:
Gus, I don't actually want to know.

GUS:
Then don't ask.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Here. (takes the bag from shoulder) This shouldn't take long. Grab a shovel. And keep an eye out for that farmer.

SHAWN and GUS start digging.

>>>LATER>>>

GUS is digging the hole, now near 5-feet deep.

GUS:
How you doing on your side?

SHAWN:
(lying down) Good, solid. I'm holding up.

GUS:
(stands over SHAWN) Shawn!

SHAWN:
(startled) What? I'm keeping watch. That's how the other guy died. What, you're not concerned? (a thrown shovel lands on his torso) All right, I get it! It's my turn.

INT. HOLE, DAY

The hole is much deeper now and both are drained from the exertion.

GUS:
This is the end of the loose dirt. Be careful.

SHAWN groans and slides down the wall. GUS taps at the hard ground with a small brush.

GUS:
This is weird.

SHAWN:
What? That there's rocks in the ground?

GUS:
These aren't rocks. These are fossils. But they've been processed, finished off, residue, rocks chipped away. Stuff you would normally do in a lab.

SHAWN:
Franzen found something.

They brush away the dirt.

GUS:
Why wouldn't he just take it out and do the work in the lab where it should be done? Unless...

SHAWN:
Unless it was too big to move. Oh, dude, I'm gonna get the leaf blower. (leaves)

GUS:
You brought a leaf blower? (follows)

EXT. FIELD, DAY

SHAWN has the leaf blower strapped to his back and GUS starts it. They both jump into the hole and dirt comes flying up into the air.

INT. HOLE, DAY

The air clears and a dirt-covered GUS and SHAWN look down on the uncovered fossil of a T-Rex head. They kneel down beside it.

SHAWN:
You got to be kidding me.

GUS:
I just discovered a dinosaur.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

Tools and dirty shoes and socks mark the path to where SHAWN and GUS collapsed on the floor, exhausted.

GUS:
Filling that hole was the worst idea ever.

SHAWN:
It had to be done, Gus. We have to save it for when we unmask Franzen's killer.

GUS:
I still don't get it.

SHAWN:
He was on the trail of... Of a fossil graveyard. It lead him right to Deacon Farms. Farmer wouldn't let him dig on the land, so he takes matters into his own hands after hours.

GUS:
But why wouldn't the farmer let him dig?

SHAWN:
Maybe he didn't want his farm disturbed.

GUS:
(sits up with a groan) A dig like that is worth millions to a land owner. And the fossils I discovered weren't even on crop land.

SHAWN:
You discovered?

GUS:
Don't try to take away my dinosaur discovery, Shawn.

SHAWN:
I wouldn't dream of it. I'm sorry. It was all you. I'm very proud of you.

GUS:
(leans back against desk) Don't you think once they unearth that thing there would be a swarm of people crashing in from all over the world?

SHAWN:
Why didn't he just lease the land?

GUS:
I don't get it.

SHAWN:
(gets up quickly) I've got an idea.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Let's ask him.

GUS:
What?! We're pretty sure we just found a cold-blooded murderer, and you want to go to his house and ask him about it?

SHAWN:
We can ask nicely.

GUS:
No!

SHAWN:
All right, all right. We come up with a cover story. We're vacuum salesmen. No, traveling gypsies. (slaps floor) No, no, no! We'll do Of Mice and Men. I'm Lennie.

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
(child-like voice) "George, you said that I could take care of those rabbits, George."

GUS:
Shawn...

SHAWN:
"And later on you're gonna cook those beans."

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
"Beans make me go..."

EXT. PRODUCE STAND, DAY

GUS:
No Lennie.

SHAWN:
Gus, you know how long I've been waiting to pull out my Lennie?

GUS:
No, Shawn, we do the National Paleontology Society thing as agreed. And we keep it very, very simple.

SHAWN:
It's not as much fun as whipping out my Lennie.

GUS:
And why are we stopping here?

SHAWN:
Have you tried these peaches?

The OWNER pops out from under the counter.

OWNER:
You're back.

SHAWN:
Yes, sir, we are. We're addicted to your citrus.

GUS:
Peaches aren't citrus, Shawn. They're stone fruit.

SHAWN:
It's the same thing.

GUS:
No, not the same thing. They have pits. Peaches, cherries, plums, and apricots.

SHAWN:
I can't do this with you right now. (to OWNER) Does your fruit come from Walker Farms?

OWNER:
Oh, no. We grow on our own little parcel of land. Deacon Walker's farm used to be a supplier of ours years ago, but they don't grow nearly as much as they used to.

SHAWN:
Thank you so much for your information. If you have a moment, my friend and I would like to buy every peach on that truck.

GUS:
Including the one you're eating.

EXT. FARMHOUSE, DAY

The Echo pulls up in front of the farmhouse. SHAWN and GUS get out and walk to the front door.

SHAWN:
You sure you don't want to do Of Mice and Men?

GUS:
You so much as slur one word, I'll give you an Indian burn so hot your socks will catch fire.

SHAWN:
Indian burn? I haven't been threatened with that this millennium.

They go up the steps to the porch.

GUS:
Take a shot if your ulna feels safe.

SHAWN:
I don't think the ulna's in the forearm.

GUS:
Trust me, it is.

SHAWN knocks on the screen door.

SHAWN:
How can you Indian burn a bone?

GUS:
Stop analyzing my threat.

SHAWN:
Get it right.

GUS:
I got it right.

The door is opened by an older man, WALKER, in a flannel shirt, jeans and suspenders.

SHAWN:
Deacon Walker?

WALKER:
Sullivan Walker.

SHAWN:
Is Deacon Walker home?

WALKER:
There is no Deacon Walker.

SHAWN:
That's confusing. I've got nothing. Gus?

GUS:
Then why name the farm Deacon Walker Farms?

WALKER:
Because it used to be called Deacon Walker. Roger Deacon was my partner. He's not anymore.

GUS:
Oh.

SHAWN:
That cleans it up nicely. Maybe we come in?

WALKER:
No. What do you want?

GUS:
We're from the National Paleontological Society...

WALKER:
Not interested. (slams door shut)

SHAWN:
Clearly he's not interested.

SHAWN knocks on the door and WALKER opens it.

SHAWN:
We would like to make you a very sizeable offer on a very small portion of your...

WALKER slams the door again. SHAWN sighs before knocking on the door again.

SHAWN:
(as Lennie face pressed against the screen) Hello, my name is Lennie. I like to...

WALKER slams the door again.

SHAWN:
You think he'd open up if we knocked again?

GUS scoffs and goes down the steps. SHAWN follows and they head back to the car.

GUS:
I'm glad it only took us an hour to get up here. Not like I wasted a whole day.

SHAWN sees that the area behind the house looks like it has been recently dug as well. There is also a small bulldozer.

SHAWN:
Franzen dug up here too?

SHAWN and GUS examine the area.

GUS:
No, he didn't. These are all new and dug with a bulldozer. A real paleontologist...

SHAWN:
Would never use such an indelicate tool, I got it.

GUS:
So our farmer's been digging too.

SHAWN:
Right. But if the gold mine's out there, why is he digging over here?

They walk back to the car and SHAWN'S phone rings. He takes it out of his pocket and reads the screen.

SHAWN:
It's my dad. Think he wants his leaf blower back? (answers phone)

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

EXT. PIER, DAY

HENRY is on the pier talking to SHAWN over the phone

HENRY:
Shawn? Shawn, you're not anywhere near that farmhouse, are you?

SHAWN:
Dad, how dare you? Of course not.

HENRY:
Good. Stay away, Shawn. I know where I remember that farm. Deacon Walker Farm. I was up there about 20 years ago. A girl reported that her boyfriend went missing. Roger Deacon. He was a partner in the farm. He was never found, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Never found?

HENRY:
That's right, the farmer claimed he went back to England or some nonsense. The point is, we never found out where he went.

SHAWN:
I think I might know where he is.

HENRY:
Where?

SHAWN:
I might be looking at him.

HENRY:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
Gotta go. (ends call)

HENRY:
Shawn! God...

SHAWN:
(looks at GUS) Dude.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN merely looks at his best friend and GUS only sighs.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK is sitting at the table as LASSITER walks.

LASSITER:
It now appears a lot of our evidence is circumstantial. We're checking the grad student's alibi, but... I'm not as confident as I like to be.

JULIET enters the room.

JULIET:
Shawn Spencer's on line one.

VICK:
What does he want?

JULIET:
He wants us to go meet him in the Ojai Valley somewhere.

VICK:
We're in the middle of the Franzen case.

JULIET:
I told him that. He guarantees that in ten minutes he can solve the case, nab the killer, close an additional unsolved murder, and...

VICK:
And what?

JULIET:
Unearth a dinosaur.

VICK:
Well, I'm curious.

VICK stands and walks out of the office with JULIET. LASSITER sighs and rubs a hand over his head as he follows.

EXT. FIELD, DAY

WALKER is showing LASSITER and JULIET his farm. They are in the field with the holes.

WALKER:
This is as far as my property goes. That's all there is. Well, I've answered all your questions, Detective. What more do you want from me?

LASSITER:
I'm not entirely sure, sir.

JULIET:
We just have one more person we need you to talk to.

SHAWN and GUS arrive with VICK. SHAWN raises a hand in greeting.

WALKER:
Lennie?

VICK:
Lennie?

GUS:
Don't even ask.

SHAWN:
My name is not Lennie, Mr. Walker. But if it were, I would've been amazing.

GUS:
No, you wouldn't have.

SHAWN:
Would've brought tears, Gus.

JULIET:
Guys, the point?

SHAWN:
The truth is  I'm a psychic. I work for the SBPD. And the mystic vibrations of the sea have brought me here to solve not one, but two murders.

GUS holds up two fingers and smiles.

WALKER:
You're a what?

As SHAWN speaks, we see what unfolded.

SHAWN:
Christopher Franzen was a persistent annoyance, huh? He couldn't help it. His department was going under. He was desperate to find something significant to save his career. And he knew that your property held the key. But you wouldn't let him dig. You couldn't let him dig. So he did what any self-respecting paleontologist on the verge of a nervous breakdown would do. He dug anyway. Secretly. Under the blanket of night. And into the early morning. And he dug, and he dug, and he found something. And that's when you found him. You knew the magnitude of the find. Once word got out, you'd never be able to keep the rest of the world from digging here too. And you couldn't have the rest of the world digging here either, could you?

Soon after SHAWN starts, LASSITER and JULIET make their way to stand behind WALKER. As he finishes, HENRY arrives.

HENRY:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Dad? What are you doing here?

HENRY:
I was worried. About my tools. (VICK sighs) What? If I had known you were finally smart enough to bring some backup, I wouldn't have had to come up here, Shawn.

GUS:
Shawn, will you tell them why Walker wouldn't let him dig?

SHAWN:
Roger Deacon.

HENRY:
Deacon is buried on the property!

SHAWN:
Dad! Dad, you just blew the big reveal.

HENRY:
You already mentioned his name, Shawn.

SHAWN:
They don't know that Deacon was the partner Walker killed 20 years ago.

WALKER:
Hey, now wait a minute here...

LASSITER:
He what now?

SHAWN:
Yeah, he killed Deacon and he buried him somewhere on the farm and he can't remember where. Isn't that right, Farmer Shootypants?

WALKER:
I don't have to stand here and take this.

LASSITER:
No, actually you do. What does this have to do with Christopher Franzen?

SHAWN:
He killed Franzen when he caught him standing above his dinosaur skull discovery, sending him flying right into the teeth of the dinosaur. But he couldn't bury him here. No, no, no, he had called the farm. He had snooped around the farm. There was a trail to the farm. No, he had to dump him somewhere where there'd be no forensics. Like the ocean. Just let the salt water clean the corpse and wash it ashore. And the murder scene. Well, he hopped on his handy bulldozer and filled the hole.

JULIET:
I'm getting a bad feeling about your streak.

LASSITER:
You too, huh?

WALKER:
I think I need a lawyer.

LASSITER:
I think you're right. Put your hands behind your back.

WALKER:
What?

LASSITER:
You heard me. (cuffs WALKER)

HENRY:
You still haven't answered the question why he dug all the holes around the house, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Dad, that's the finale. That's why I don't invite you to these things. (normal) He was looking for Deacon's body.

Whatever.

VICK:
Are we done here, Mr. Spencer?

SHAWN:
No, we're not done. For my final demonstration...  (takes out shovel) I will now discover a dinosaur.

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Actually, Gus will discover a dinosaur. (holds out the shovel to GUS)

GUS:
(reaches for shovel) Wait a second. You just want me to dig this hole.

SHAWN:
I do not.

GUS:
I'm not falling for that, Shawny boy. You dig it.

SHAWN:
Fine. I'll take credit for the discovery.

GUS:
Oh, no, you won't. Give me that shovel. (grabs the shovel)

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's too late. You blew it.

As SHAWN and GUS fight over the shovel and the right to make the claim, the others leave unnoticed.

GUS:
What?!

SHAWN:
And whoever discovers it gets to name it. I'm naming him Zippy. Or Chompy. Zippy the Dinosaur, discovered by psychic paleo-sleuth Shawn Spencer!

GUS:
Give me this shovel, Shawn!

SHAWN yanks the shovel out of GUS' hands.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

BUZZ erases the board marking LASSITER'S streak and wheels it away. LASSITER walks over to his desk followed by JULIET.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER:
Killed by a dinosaur. And he's right. It was an actual dinosaur.

JULIET:
Technically, it's the fall that killed him.

LASSITER:
Not helping. Who am I kidding? I am doomed. I am never gonna suspect an extinct creature. How can I compete with that?

JULIET:
You don't have to compete.

LASSITER:
O'Hara, I am physically incapable of pointing the finger at a dragon or a leprechaun or the Loch Ness Monster. (sits on desk) I quit. I'm gonna donate my badge to charity.

JULIET:
It was a good run, Carlton. All streaks have to end. Lou Boudreau fielded the ball cleanly. You have to let it go.

LASSITER:
Who the hell is Lou Boudreau?

JULIET:
He recorded the out that ended DiMaggio's hit streak. Don't you watch baseball?

LASSITER:
Of course I watch baseball. I just don't know meaningless facts from 75 years ago.

JULIET:
66.

LASSITER:
You disturb me.

JULIET:
Do you need a hug?

LASSITER:
(stands, affronted) Oh, what do I look like? (walks off but comes back) Yeah, I'll take the hug. (breaks hug) Okay, thanks. (leaves)

JULIET:
Okay.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN enters the kitchen, jacket over his shoulder, motorcycle helmet in hand. HENRY, GUS and DOUG are waiting for him. GUS is eating.

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, you guys. We're still doing this intervention thing?

HENRY:
Yes, yes, Shawn, we are. Son, you have no sense of responsibility. (sits) And lately you've been purposefully putting yourself in a severe amount of unnecessary danger. On top of which, you are constantly belittling the good work of...

DOUG:
Actually, Henry, I stretched the truth a bit. This isn't about Shawn. This is about you.

HENRY:
What?

SHAWN looks a little smug as he stands beside DOUG.

DOUG:
Can we talk about your obsessive need for control?

HENRY:
(stands and points angrily) You come into my house, Devette. You lie to me?!

DOUG:
Let's try to be rational. Did you really drive all the way up to Ojai just to crash Shawn's crowning moment?

HENRY:
Get out.

DOUG:
Henry, we're here for you. At least listen.

HENRY:
Out now. Get out! Out!

DOUG, GUS and SHAWN head for the door as HENRY chases them out.

SHAWN:
I'd like to start. When I was about seven, he...

HENRY closes the door behind them and locks it.

Episode 2x03 Psy vs, Psy

I might get one more in before Christmas, if you're lucky!



INT. VICE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, DAY

The Vice Principal, PETLIC, is sitting behind his desk as SHAWN and HENRY - in uniform - face him.

HENRY:
Look I'm telling you, my son Shawn did not have a permission to go on that field trip.

PETLIC:
Well, he did turn in his permission slip signed by you. (shows HENRY the form)

HENRY:
(looks at form) Signature's a forgery. It's a fake.

PETLIC:
Well, that's a little dramatic, don't you think, Mr. Spencer?

HENRY:
Look, this form is a counterfeit. These are serious charges, and my son needs to be punished.

PETLIC:
(pulls out other forms and places them on the desk) Mr. Spencer, all three are permission slips also signed by you.

HENRY:
(picks up the forms) Yes. Yep. Yes. Yes. (puts the forms back on the desk) Those...those are my signatures.

PETLIC:
Well, you see, then? I'd be hard-pressed to believe that a child of Shawn's age could be capable of such detailed forgery.

HENRY:
Well, you don't know my son. No offense, but you are the vice principal of a middle school, not a handwriting expert. That testimony's not gonna hold up in court.

PETLIC:
Well, we're not talking court. Are we? You know, 'cause if we were, you should know that I did take a handwriting personality course at the Learning Annex last summer, and I can tell by the way you, uh, turn your "N" humps, that you have a very open and childlike kindness about you. (SHAWN snickers) I could be off on that. You know, it... it was a one-night seminar.

HENRY:
Okay, now, as a sergeant with the Santa Barbara Police Department, let me tell you what I know. See the pen lift on the "R" there? The bleed mark,that shows hesitation, as if thinking, "Gee, how do I form that next letter?" Now I don't know about you, but I don't have to think about how to sign my own damn name. So you're wrong.

SHAWN:
Really? I don't know, Dad. I think Mr. Petlic has a point. They look pretty identical to me.

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the station and turn the hall. Up ahead they see a man sitting and tying his shoes. They can only see his legs and hands.

SHAWN:
Hey, check it out. There's Lassiter. Make a loop like a bunny's ear, wrap it around, careful as you steer. (claps) That's a good boy, Lassie. (the man stands) Wait a minute. You're not Lassie.

The MAN is wearing a black suit and has a visitor pass clipped to his upper-pocket.

MAN:
Well, I don't know what a Lassie is, but I'm not it. I'm Special Agent Lars Ewing with the FTD.

SHAWN:
You're a special florist?

EWING:
(holds up badge) Federal Treasury Department.

SHAWN:
We have a department that deals exclusively with treasures?

EWING:
(taps buttons on watch) If you'll excuse me, I have a meeting in an Interim Chief Vick's office. (tries to walk past SHAWN and GUS)

SHAWN:
That's where our meeting is! This is very exciting. I feel nervous. Is that what you're wearing?

EWING:
This goes against every federal bone in my body, but who are you guys?

SHAWN:
I'm not familiar with the federal bone. Is that connected to the hip bone or the knee bone?

EWING:
(leans forward towards SHAWN) Well, I can tell you what the knee bone is gonna connect with if you don't get out of my way.

GUS:
I'm gonna guess, not the funny bone?

SHAWN laughs mockingly as EWING brushes past.

SHAWN:
Wow.

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
This meeting is bigger than we thought.

They continue towards VICK'S office. SHAWN sees a WOMAN sitting on bench making a phone call.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. (stops) Get us some seats close to the desk, but not on the side. I'll catch up in a second.

GUS continues on and SHAWN walks past the WOMAN before doubling back to stand in front of her.

SHAWN:
Waiting for Godot? Guffman. Waiting to Exhale?

WOMAN:
(puts phone in purse) I'm not waiting to exhale.

SHAWN:
(holds out hand) Shawn Spencer.

WOMAN:
(stands and shakes his hand) Lindsay Leikin.

SHAWN:
I'm the head psychic in the department. This is sort of my joint.

LINDSAY:
They, um, hire psychics around here?

SHAWN focuses on LINDSAY'S fingertips.

LINDSAY:
Personally, I'm a little bit skeptical.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. (holds hands up to head) I was just getting a very strong vibration. Did you... did you just recently take up the guitar?

LINDSAY:
Oh, my God. Yes, just recently. Very impressive. How did you do that?

SHAWN:
Sometimes there's just this amazingly strong connection from the word go. I'm getting something else. This is gonna be a very, very good week for you, Lindsay Leikin.

LINDSAY:
Really? I didn't think...

SHAWN:
Just let it happen. (walks away)

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN enters the office as VICK welcomes EWING. LASSITER, JULIET and GUS are already there.

VICK:
So let me officially welcome you to Santa Barbara. We are all ready and willing to...

SHAWN:
Don't let me interrupt. Please continue. (to GUS) What'd I say about seats on the side?

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, this is Special Agent Ewing from the Treasury Department in Washington.

SHAWN:
Yes, we sniffed one another in the hallway.

SHAWN looks over at EWING and makes an upward motion with his left hand. EWING looks down to check his fly. He glares over at SHAWN when he realizes he's been played.

VICK:
He is here because they have been tracking an aggressive forger who's been counterfeiting large numbers of $100 bills and then laundering the money into small communities across the country.

EWING:
The last being a Home Depot right here in the heart of your little hamlet.

LASSITER:
Well, we are raring to help you with this federal bust.

EWING:
Who is this?

VICK:
This is Carlton Lassiter, our head detective, and his junior partner, Juliet O'Hara.

EWING:
Ah, the name Juliet. "How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night." Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet.

SHAWN:
"Tootie, you in trouble." It's Mindy Cohn. Facts of Life?

EWING:
(takes device out of inner jacket pocket, turns it on and places it on the desk) Could you gentlemen please state your name once again? And please speak clearly.

LASSITER:
Is that a recording device? Government issued?

EWING:
Asking if that is a recording device is like asking if this (holds out pen) is a pen.

LASSITER:
Is it a pen?

EWING:
That's classified. (winks at JULIET)

GUS:
(to SHAWN) It's tiny. Probably can't hold much.

EWING:
Oh, that's not a tape recorder. That is a high-tech microphone system attached to a Mildred.

JULIET:
A Mildred? What's... what's a Mildred?

LASSITER:
I believe it's an intelligence-gathering device. "Mildred" is probably an anagram. Military Intel Listening Device Recorder... something.

EWING:
Mildred is not a device. She's my stenographer. (steps to the side to reveal an older woman sitting at a stenograph)

GUS:
You have your own stenographer?

EWING:
I am hyper-careful. Can't take any chances. Saved my behind more than once in making cases stick past deposition.

LASSITER:
Brilliant. Chief?

VICK:
Not happening. Now what I need from all of you is your full cooperation in assisting Special Agent Ewing in any way he sees fit. Now, any questions?

SHAWN:
(raises his hand) I have a question for Special.

EWING:
(irritated) Who is this?

VICK:
I'm sorry. This is Shawn Spencer. And his partner, Burton Guster. Mr. Spencer is a psychic with the department who I thought might be helpful.

EWING:
Well, next time I have to go on a panty raid, I'll give him a call.

LASSITER laughs.

EWING:
But we already have our own psychic. She's just started in the department and she is already a superstar. Got us so close to the counterfeiter a month ago in Wilmette, Illinois. We must have missed him by only a few minutes.

LINDSAY enters the office.

EWING:
Mr. Spencer, Lindsay...

SHAWN:
Leikin. We too met in the hallway.

VICK:
Okay, then let's adjourn this meeting. I know Special Agent Ewing has prepared informational packets for all of you. We will meet at the Home Depot tomorrow.

EWING:
Let's say... (checks watch) 0700 hours.

SHAWN:
700 hours is almost 20 days. Shouldn't we act sooner?

JULIET:
0700 is 7:00 a. m.

EWING:
Precisely, Detective. Striking and whip-smart. Intriguing.

LASSITER:
I knew that too.

EWING:
(to JULIET) You have Pennsylvania Ave. running through your veins. Ever consider taking the Bureau exam?

JULIET looks over at VICK and turns to walk out of the office, away from the flirting EWING. EWING follows as LASSITER tags along.

LASSITER:
I have.

VICK:
Let me set up that conference area for you. Right this way. (leaves the office)

SHAWN:
(crosses arms) Little skeptical of psychics, are we?

LINDSAY:
I should have said "just you". And don't think I didn't pick up on that "calluses on my hands" guitar clue. Good one. This is gonna be good. I'm gonna solve this case, and I'm gonna prove you're a fake. Fun, right? (leaves)

SHAWN:
Hmm.

EXT. SHOPPING PLAZA, DAY

EWING and LINDSAY walk in front of the Santa Barbara crew.

VICK:
Okay, you are all instructed to cooperate fully with the federal agents. I'll be damned if we're gonna get shown up on our own turf. They may be the feds, but we are a team and this is our town. They will need us.

EWING:
You breached protocol, Leikin. I waited outside the hotel, 0630. You weren't there.

LINDSAY:
Yeah, sorry, I got up early and went to go get coffee.

SHAWN walks behind them, listening.

INT. HOME DEPOT, CHECKOUT, DAY

EWING is interrogating the cashier.

EWING:
Son, let me ask you a question. What made you think those $100 bills were authentic?

CASHIER:
Um, 'cause they said "100" on them?

EWING:
Are you an idiot? Don't answer that. If I plopped a Granny Smith apple down on this counter and carved a "100" on it, would you accept that as legal tender? Don't answer that. Do you know what microprinting is?

CASHIER:
I'm confused. Should I answer that?

LASSITER:
(raises hand) I know what it is.

EWING:
The introduction of microprinting as an anti-replicant feature began in 1990 with the addition (shows a $100 bill in his billfold) of the words "United States of America" printed around Ben Franklin's lapel. In addition, the words "U.S. 100" are printed within the lines of the lower left 100.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, is it just me, or is this unbearably boring? I don't know how Ms. Leikin works, but Gus and I are going to investigate the body of the store and search for our culprit's twisted, wretched, filthy aura, because that is what serious psychics do.

>>>LATER>>>

INT. HOME DEPOT, FLOOR, DAY

A forklift beeps as it rises above some shelving. On it, SHAWN stands to get a better view of the store.

GUS:
(sees SHAWN) Shawn, what are you doing?

HENRY is shopping. He hears GUS and looks up.

HENRY:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
Dad. Wow, you look so tiny down there.

HENRY:
What the hell are you doing up there?

SHAWN:
What does it look like I'm doing? We're making a case, a federal one.

HENRY:
Oh, of course you are. Well, when you've finished wrapping things up for the Pentagon, I want you at my house. I got a project for you.

SHAWN:
Afraid we're gonna be a little busy having our pictures taken with the President of the United States of America.

HENRY:
Mm, oh, I think you'll be there. You owe me.

SHAWN:
I owe you?

HENRY:
Yeah, for the last 12 times I helped you solve one of your little cases. You agreed.

SHAWN:
Gus, did I agree to that?

GUS:
Well, technically...

HENRY:
Gus!

GUS:
I think you did. (walks away)

HENRY:
See ya. (leaves)

SHAWN sees the security cameras.

INT. HOME DEPOT, SECURITY OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the security office. SHAWN knocks on the door and the heavyset GUARD turns away from the bank of monitors to face them.

GUARD:
Excuse me. Can I help you guys?

SHAWN:
Hello, Garrison. We're working on the counterfeiting case, and we need to see all of yesterday's security footage.

We see GARRISON'S name badge.

GARRISON:
How do you know my name's Garrison?

SHAWN:
(whispers to GUS) And you thought this was gonna be a problem? (normal voice) I'm sorry, man. I... I didn't mean to freak you out. My name is Shawn Spencer. I'm a psychic with the police department.

GARRISON:
There was already a psychic here last night. From Washington, no less. She looked at all the tapes and there was no positive ID.

SHAWN:
She already came here, huh?

GARRISON:
Mmm-hmm, and she's good. She also knew my name was Garrison.

SHAWN:
Uh, you mind if I take a peek anyway? I work a little differently than her. My process is a little more complex. I can sometimes pick up images that are underneath the epidermal layer.

SHAWN and GUS walk over to the computers and GARRISON swivels his chair back around to the monitors. GARRISON pulls up the moment that LINDSAY looked at.

GARRISON:
Here it is. This is the tape of the counterfeiter that she looked at last night. You know, honestly, if that pretty lady psychic couldn't pick up anything, I can't imagine you're gonna have much luck.

SHAWN zooms in on the car keys, registering the logo.

SHAWN:
You know what, you're probably right. We gave it a shot. Thanks, Garrison. (leaves)

GUS follows SHAWN out of the room.

INT. HOME DEPOT, CHECKOUT, DAY

EWING, LASSITER, JULET, VICK and LINDSAY are still with the CASHIER.

JULIET:
Tall? Short? Age? Race?

SHAWN and GUS arrive.

EWING:
Do you mean to tell me that the only thing you can remember clearly is that he was a man?

CASHIER:
And technically, I can't even be sure of that, now, can I?

As the CASHIER answers, EWING leans towards JULIET and sniffs her hair.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. I'm getting something. He... did not wear corrective lenses.

LINDSAY rolls her eyes.

CASHIER:
Actually, that is true.

VICK:
Okay, well, that's something to go on. Good work, Mr. Spencer.

LASSITER:
Great, yes, we're looking for someone in Santa Barbara who does not wear glasses.

LINDSAY:
He... He had a small scar about three inches, on the jaw line, and he wore a single stud diamond in his left ear.

CASHIER:
Yes. And yes. She's exactly right. I can see that clearly now.

EWING:
That's why she's the best.

EWING heads for the door and, after a smirk in SHAWN'S direction, LINDSAY follows.

JULIET:
Tough break.

JULES follows LASSITER and VICK out the door.

SHAWN:
What? Jules?

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and HENRY are looking at 2x4s resting on sawhorses. There are blueprints on top.

SHAWN:
Dad, I'm confused. There are plans for a wet bar.

HENRY:
Yeah, that's right, for entertaining.

SHAWN:
Right, but I don't see anywhere in the plans the portal into 1976.

HENRY:
Shawn, a wet bar happens to be a timeless home feature.

SHAWN:
Right, perfect for those warm summer evenings when Reggie Jackson and Dyan Cannon swing by for Harvey Wallbangers.

HENRY:
Shawn, are you gonna crack wise or are you gonna get to work?

SHAWN:
I feel like it should be noted that neither Gus nor myself are licensed plumbers.

HENRY:
Yes, I understand that, Shawn. I've already installed the sink. All you two have to do is connect the fittings.

SHAWN bends over and looks under the frame of the bar as HENRY walks away. SHAWN straightens up and rubs his hands together.

SHAWN:
All right, let's get to work. (goes behind bar)

GUS:
Seriously?

SHAWN:
This will be good.

GUS:
It will?

SHAWN:
Work is good, Gus. Work is glorious. It's the breath of life. (holds up a drill) What is this?

GUS:
It's a drill.

SHAWN:
Of course it is. Don't be ridiculous.

GUS:
You're still upset that Lindsay showed you up at the crime scene, aren't you?

SHAWN:
What is her trick?

GUS:
Maybe she's just more psychic-y than you. (walks to the center of the room)

SHAWN:
Gus, don't be ridiculous. There's no such thing as psychics.

GUS:
I don't know, Shawn. Even I've been getting a little bit of intuition lately. In fact, I'm getting something right now. (does an impression of SHAWN having a vision) Something very strong. She's... she's...better than you.

SHAWN:
You know, they say imitation is the greatest form of flattery, but that hurts. It hurts below the belt.

GUS:
Shawn, if you want to beat her, then we have to actually work the case. (walks back to the bar) Utilize my knowledge. You know I have a coin collection. I've studied tender from around the world. I have over 85 Buffalo nickels, Shawn. (puts hands on hips)

SHAWN:
Okay. First of all, and this is key, don't ever, under any circumstances, ever admit that to anyone outside of these walls. Secondly, I love utilizing your knowledge, Gus. I can't wait until we have the case of the missing thimble. But this case is not about counterfeiting. It's about me versus her. Ecks versus Sever. Joe versus the Volcano.

GUS:
Fine. Then let's get to it. What do you know?

SHAWN:
All right, this is what I got. He managed not to be identified on any of the security cameras, which means he's smart. Smart enough to stay ahead of the game.

GUS:
Which means changing up anything that could be linked or traced to him.

SHAWN:
Like his vehicle. His key. It was distinctively Nissan. Probably a Murano. Maybe a Sentra.

GUS:
So we go back and check the outdoor surveillance cameras from the store, and look for Nissans in the parking lot yesterday.

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I already tipped Lassiter off to that. The only one that didn't check out was a new one with no plates.

GUS:
Ewing's informational packet links this guy to over a dozen vehicles since he left Washington. His pattern's to spend six to eight days in a town before pricking up ears.

SHAWN:
You read Ewing's informational packet?

GUS:
Cover to cover.

SHAWN:
That's weird. I just read the cover. But I don't need to read the whole thing to know that that's his M.O. He's too smart to still be driving that car, Gus. He's gotta be switching out his mode of transportation on a daily basis.

GUS:
And paying cash.

SHAWN:
Gotta launder as much of that funny money as he can.

GUS:
So the question is, to which car dealership would a crook go to spend lots of cash without pricking up ears?

The drill whirrs in SHAWN'S hand.

INT. UPSCALE CAR DEALERSHIP, FLOOR, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the showroom

SHAWN:
This must be what Jay Leno feels like when he walks into his garage. Which makes you Kevin Eubanks.

GUS:
I don't think they roll around town together, Shawn. Can we talk to the owner?

SHAWN:
First we play customer. It's the people who groove on the floor that are gonna give us the scoop, Gus.

They approach a salesman talking to a woman with her back to them.

SHAWN:
Excuse me, my buddy here is interested in the banana yellow Ferrari, though he's neither gay nor European. I hope that's not a prob...

The woman turns around and it is LINDSAY.

LINDSAY:
Look who finally figured it out. A little late.

SHAWN and GUS look into the manager's office to see VICK, JULIET, LASSITER and EWING.

GUS:
How did you not notice her, Shawn?

SHAWN:
I wasn't expecting her to be here.

GUS:
You were looking right at her.

SHAWN:
She's got me all out of whack.

GUS:
Get your head in the game.

VICK, JULIET and LASSITER approach SHAWN and GUS.

SHAWN:
So what's going on? No one calls us anymore. That's the new thing? I thought we were a team.

LASSITER:
Yeah, first of all, the whole "team" thing. She wasn't talking to you. And secondly, Ewing didn't call me. He called O'Hara.

SHAWN looks at JULIET as if to say "Oh, really?"

JULIET:
It's not like I asked him to.

SHAWN:
It's okay, Clarice. You don't have to make excuses to us.

JULIET:
It wasn't just today. My phone's been ringing all the time. I don't know how he got my home number. I mean, please. Do you think I wanted to pick up my phone at 2:00 a.m. and hear his voice all gravelly and masculine? (looks across the showroom floor at EWING) Probably called from the hotel. Maybe just got out of the shower or...finished with a swim. (gets a little carried away with her imagination) Dripping wet. (realizes and recovers her professionalism)

VICK:
Just catch Mr. Spencer and Mr. Guster up on what Ms. Leikin was able to figure out.

LASSITER:
Apparently our guy came in here, bought a used Lamborghini for $47,000 in cash.

JULIET:
Next day, he tries to return it. All sales are final, but the sales manager makes a concession, offering mere $26,000 in cash.

GUS:
He accepts it? What kind of idiot is this guy?

VICK:
A genius idiot, according to the Feds.

LASSITER:
You see, those familiar with this sort of thing know that it's the classic grift. Essentially, he traded 47 Gs of worthless paper for $26,000 in cold, hard cash. I've seen it before.

SHAWN:
Where? In a Mamet play?

GUS:
Any witnesses?

JULIET:
No, but a Lamborghini was spotted outside of town in Goleta, but it was moving too fast to make an ID. (crosses arms and looks over at EWING) You know, I don't think he's a swimmer. He's not really that build. I bet he plays rugby.

EWING and LINDSAY walk over to them.

LASSITER:
Hey, what color is that suit?

EWING:
Black.

LASSITER:
Really? It seems blacker than black.

EWING:
It's Washington black.

LASSITER turns to JULIET and mouths "Washington black".

EWING:
Look, if anyone wants to join me, I'm gonna be taking a look at some of the bills from the safe that didn't get deposited.

EWING heads for the office and LASSITER follows eagerly. JULIET, VICK and GUS follow. SHAWN walks with LINDSAY.

SHAWN:
Look, Leikin, I think it's possible that we got off on the wrong foot.

LINDSAY:
Is that right?

SHAWN:
Yeah, I mean, this is silly. We should join forces like Pitt and Jolie, you know? Work together, make it nice for everyone.

LINDSAY:
I don't think you get it. I have nothing to gain here. If you haven't noticed, my job is safe. It's you I'm worried about, faker.

SHAWN:
In that case, maybe we should just date.

LINDSAY:
I'm seeing somebody.

SHAWN:
Well, is it...

LINDSAY:
Serious?  Yes.

SHAWN:
You didn't know I was gonna...

LINDSAY:
Yes, I did. (turns on her heel and leaves)

INT. UPSCALE CAR DEALERSHIP, OFFICE, DAY

LINDSAY pushes past GUS to stand by EWING as he tests the bills. SHAWN enters and stands next to GUS.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Dude, don't you know the move where you take off your jacket and you lay it across some seats?

GUS:
(jabs SHAWN) Get your head in the game, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(pushes against LINDSAY) Uh, budgies?

LINDSAY shoves him back and he moves to her other side and leans in as EWING discusses his initial findings.

EWING:
These are good. (holds bill up to the light) But they're not great. You see how on this bill, the edge of the nose on Ben Franklin's cloudy?

SHAWN focuses in on one of the other bills in EWING'S hand and how the colors seem to shift.

EWING:
(speaks into microphone) Did you get that, Mildred?

Out on the showroom floor, MILDRED raises a hand, thumb up.

SHAWN:
(goes back to GUS) (whispers) Hey, is there any reason a $100 bill would change colors?

GUS:
(whispers) Actually, yes. It's an effect caused by color-shifting ink. It's only present in $100 bills. The changing color is called color diffraction. And it's made possible when light reflects off of metallic flakes added to the ink.

SHAWN makes a note of the serial number of the real bill.

SHAWN:
Good work, Gus.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN and GUS fist bump.

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

VICK, LASSITER, JULIET, EWING and LINDSAY are sitting at the conference table.

VICK:
So we'll check the information that Ms. Leikin's gathered for us...

VICK stops when SHAWN and GUS enter and take seats at the table.

SHAWN:
Thank goodness! Finally, some nice seats, huh? This is what I'm talking about.

Everyone seems uncomfortable, refusing to look at SHAWN or GUS directly.

SHAWN:
What? Did I... did I just sit in something? (stands) Gus, do I have pudding on my jeans?

GUS:
(looks at SHAWN'S jeans) No, no.

SHAWN:
Nothing? (sits)

GUS:
Shawn. I think we're not welcomed here.

SHAWN:
Gus, don't be a paranoid schizophrenic. We're always welcome here.

GUS:
No, look.

SHAWN:
(SHAWN realizes no one will meet his gaze) Oh, my God. We're not welcome.

VICK:
It's nothing personal, Mr. Spencer. Special Agent Ewing just feels that Ms. Leiken has things covered on the psychic front, and I have to agree with him.

SHAWN:
Okay. I can take a hint. Certainly don't need to be told twice.

GUS:
I think you were just told three times.

SHAWN:
You know what, this is fine, because we had a good run. Thank you for the memories.

SHAWN and GUS stand and head for the door. SHAWN and stops and turns around.

SHAWN:
Oh, just one more thing. You might want to check the cash from the dealership, because it's not all counterfeit. (mock salutes and starts to walks away)

EWING:
(stands) That's ridiculous. (SHAWN stops) If I had learned how to laugh as a child, I would right now. I looked at all those bills myself. Do you really want to go against the leading special agent in counterfeiting with 14 years of experience under his belt and say that those bills weren't fake?

SHAWN:
Not all of them. Just one. And I believe the serial number was ALD97570807...7!

SHAWN and GUS walk away. EWING looks at the bills with a magnifying glass.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk away from the conference room.

GUS:
Where are we going? Shouldn't we have stayed until they checked the bills out?

SHAWN:
Wait for it. Wait for it...

LASSITER comes out of the conference room followed by the others.

LASSITER:
Spencer! Hold up.

JULIET:
The bill checked out. It's real.

EWING:
(stands in front of SHAWN and crosses arms) All right, answer me this, Mr. Psychic. Why would a counterfeiter ever use real bills?

SHAWN:
Because he had to. Man... I read your informational packet cover to cover. Our guy spends six to eight days in every city... we're only on day four. Quite simply, he ran out of dough. He didn't know what kind of deal he'd be able to make on the car. Turns out, short one bill.

GUS:
Lucky for us.

VICK:
So what's our next move?

EWING:
Well, I'll call Washington and begin...

VICK:
I'm sorry, I was asking Mr. Spencer.

SHAWN:
Oh... oh, you want to know what I think his next move is. Oh, Gus, look, she wants... Well, let's see here. He's gotta print more money. My guess is he, uh, set up shop here in town. So... we find his little nest, we find him.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN is wearing a floral apron and holds a pink plastic device in his hand.

SHAWN:
Well, buddy, I really hope you like this. It took me 19 hours to bake. Put it in last night before bed.

GUS:
It takes 19 hours to bake a pineapple upside-down cake?

SHAWN:
(pulls a small cake from an Easy Bake oven) It does when it's being heated by a 60-watt bulb. (places the cake on GUS' desk)

GUS:
It's not upside down, Shawn.

There's a knock on the door.

GUS:
Who could that be at this hour?

LINDSAY appears in the doorway.

SHAWN:
Huh.

LINDSAY:
Are you gonna invite me in?

SHAWN looks over at GUS who grunts noncommittally.

SHAWN:
I don't know. I guess.

GUS sits in his desk chair as LINDSAY enters the office.

LINDSAY:
So this is what a psychic detective office looks like. You know, I always imagined it... Does something smell like pineapple?

SHAWN:
Pineapple upside-down cake. Would you like some? Wait, before you answer that, are you a fan of delicious flavor?

LINDSAY:
All right, look. This isn't easy for me to say, but... I was wrong. You're better than I thought. Your discovery at the station today was a huge get. I think we should work together after all. The faster we find out where the counterfeiter's den is, the better. That is, if you guys are willing.

SHAWN:
Hmm.

GUS:
Hmm.

SHAWN:
Depends, don't you think, Gus?

>>>LATER>>>

SHAWN, GUS and LINDSAY are sitting in the leather chairs grouped in a circle. SHAWN has his eyes closed and hands to his temples.

SHAWN:
Wait. I'm definitely getting something. Oh, this is good. It's a... it's a...it's a transient location, uh, where people can come and go anonymously, paying in cash. And... and it's remote, so they can print large sums of money on a noisy printer without being heard.

LINDSAY:
(closes her eyes) Yes... yes, I'm getting that same thing.

SHAWN:
(opens eyes and leans forward) Yes.

LINDSAY:
And I see it.

SHAWN:
Yes?

LINDSAY:
It's by a body of water.

SHAWN:
(disappointed) Really? It's by a body of water? Leikin, that's amateur stuff. You know what? I might expect that from John Edwards, definitely from Miss Cleo, but not from you, Leikin.

LINDSAY:
Wait. I'm also...I'm also getting something in French. A sign, maybe? Could it be a European hotel?

GUS:
Wait a minute. She may be on to something. I know this particular hotel. It's on my sales route, on a private beach.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
It's just... That's strange. I'm... I'm pretty familiar with your route, Gus. I don't recall any private beaches with hotels on them.

GUS:
What are you talking about, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Where was it you went last summer for the Pips autograph signing convention?

LINDSAY:
You met Gladys Knight?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Just the Pips. (grins)

GUS:
Actually, a Pip. The other two got stuck in traffic. Look, I don't wanna talk about it. The point is, it's been under construction for months. Which would account for the noise. And it caters to Europeans. This could be the place.

SHAWN:
Sweet. We totally scored. But you couldn't have got that without my transient location thing, am I right?

LINDSAY has the pineapple upside-down cake on a plate and takes a bite with a fork. She gags and spits it out.

LINDSAY:
I don't... I don't think that cake is cooked.

INT. HOTEL, LOBBY, NIGHT

The seven investigators approach the reception desk. LASSITER and EWING talk at the same time to the CLERK.

EWING:
I need to know every guest who's paid in cash in the last week.

LASSITER:
Listen, pal, I need a list of every guest in the hotel.

CLERK:
(British accent) I'm sorry, who are you, and what do you want?

EWING:
(shows badge) Special Agent Lars Ewing. Federal Treasury Department.

LASSITER:
(shows badge) Head Detective Carlton Lassiter, Santa Barbara Police Department.

EWING:
Presidential Recommendation for Distinguished Service.

LASSITER:
Presidential Physical Fitness award. Eighth, ninth, and tenth grade. And I've got a cocktail napkin from Air Force One.

EWING:
I personally arrested Ivan Boesky.

LASSITER:
I wrestled in high school.

EWING:
What? With your conscience?

LASSITER:
(starts to take off jacket) That is it!

LINDSAY holds back EWING as VICK puts a hand on LASSITER'S arm.

VICK:
Relax.

JULIET:
Oh, oh, oh. Hey. Hey! Hey! (stands between EWING and LASSITER)(to CLERK) Look, we need to know who's paid with cash or travelers checks recently.

LASSITER straightens his jacket.

EWING:
(leans over and whispers to JULIET) My God, you're a firecracker.

CLERK:
It would probably be easier to ask who didn't.

JULIET:
I'm sorry?

CLERK:
This is a hotel. We're a cash business, lots of European travelers. Well, with what foreign credit card companies charge these days, cash is king.

SHAWN bends over and sees a sign for the south tower - "Mezzanine to walkway".

SHAWN:
The south tower, I see him. I see him in the south tower.

JULIET:
How many rooms in the south tower?

CLERK:
There are 170.

SHAWN walks over and rests his elbows on the counter, hands to his head.

LASSITER:
All right, let's start banging on some doors and call for backup. If we tap every available source of manpower, we can have this thing done 18, 19 hours tops.

EWING:
I can alert Washington right now and have an 80-man SWAT team on a C-130 Hercules. They could be here in less than three hours.

SHAWN:
Filthy sheets! I see dirty, filthy sheets.

LINDSAY:
Yes, and towels on the floor.

SHAWN:
And a mediocre, half-eaten turkey club sandwich. And he's refused maid service.

JULIET:
Okay, what guest refused maid service?

CLERK:
I might remind you we do cater to a very European crowd.

SHAWN:
He's isolated. He's in a less-desirable room that's not facing the ocean. Do you have any rooms that face the parking lot?

CLERK:
A few.

SHAWN:
He's in one of those.

CLERK:
Well, let's see. (goes through computer)

SHAWN takes a hard candy from the bowl on the counter and tosses it to GUS who puts it in his shirt pocket.

CLERK:
French woman. Another French party. Here, here's a single gentleman, paid all in cash, corner room facing the alley, and according to this, he's never taken his "do not disturb" sign off his door.

SHAWN and GUS fist bump.

EWING:
(slaps counter) Room number.

LASSITER:
(slaps counter) Key!

INT. HOTEL, ROOM, NIGHT

LASSITER enters the room first, gun drawn. He is closely followed by EWING who also has his gun out.

BOTH:
Clear!

They glare at each other before lowering their weapons. The others enter.

EWING:
Nice job, psychics, let's get to work.

JULIET takes notice of the stacked washer and dryer against the wall.

JULIET:
(to VICK) That's a really cute front-loader.

EWING:
Thank you. He prints the money, then he washes it here to soften it. Then he tumbles it dry and beats it up with stones to give it that... natural, worn texture.

SHAWN looks into the open closet and sees a wrapper for linen paper containing 500 sheets.

SHAWN:
(whispers to GUS) Dude, there's linen fibers in that paper. What was he doing, amending the Constitution?

GUS:
(whispers) You can't print money on regular paper, Shawn. That's government-issue.

LINDSAY:
I'm getting a visual. He printed a batch of about 50.000, which will last him a while.

EWING:
(stands by copier) Five bills a sheet, at least 80 sheets missing from this ream that sounds about right.

SHAWN:
Wait. No, I'm getting more. I'm getting a lot more, like 500.000, which would last more than just a while. Maybe... maybe a whole lifetime.

LINDSAY:
That's not possible.

SHAWN:
It is if you live in one of the Baltic states.

LINDSAY:
I'm just not getting that feeling, at all. Anything over 50,000 is just getting blocked from my receptors. Not a chance.

SHAWN:
Receptors? Really?

SHAWN raises his right hand and acts as if he has no control over it. He backs up to the closet and reaches over his head for the paper wrapper he had seen earlier. He grabs it with subtle nods from GUS directing him. He pulls it down and EWING comes over and takes it from his hand. LASSITER finds something interesting on one of the tables.

EWING:
This would do it. This is a 500-sheet ream, and it's likely he used it all.

SHAWN gasps and holds his arm like it hurts after being "possessed".

LASSITER:
Is this a Treasury seal?

EWING walks over to LASSITER, shoving the paper at VICK as he passes her. He picks up the object in question with his bare hands. With attention focused elsewhere, SHAWN and GUS fist bump.

EWING:
No, passport seal.

SHAWN:
Uh, this guy's officially on the lam. We don't catch him now, we can kiss him good-bye.

INT. HOTEL, LOBBY, NIGHT

The seven investigators arrive back at the lobby via the stairs.

LASSITER:
The railway stations, obviously the airport security has been notified, and all the interstate agencies are on alert.

JULIET:
They've all been given the sketch based on Ms. Leikin's description of the suspect.

VICK:
Okay, but please keep your phones on just in case we get any movement.

GUS:
What's the point? Nobody ever bothers to call us anymore.

EWING, VICK, LASSITER and JULIET leave the building. LINDSAY turns and walks back to SHAWN and GUS.

LINDSAY:
Shawn, I don't do this much, but I just wanted to say thank you. I know we haven't nailed him yet, but you were right, we make a good team.

SHAWN:
Yes, we do. And hopefully tomorrow we'll wrap this thing up. (holds out his hand) Have a good night.

LINDSAY shakes SHAWN'S hand. GUS holds out his but she turns and walks away.

SHAWN:
Wait for it. Wait for it.

LINDSAY stops, hand on the door, and turns around and walks back.

LINDSAY:
Shawn, I was thinking maybe we could go somewhere now. Maybe continue working to see if we can't stumble upon some collective apparition.

SHAWN:
That's a fantastic idea. I love it, but where could we go at this hour that's still open? You know what, I think there's a Color Me Mine that stays open late.

LINDSAY:
You don't quit with the jokes, do you?

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, would you like me to stop?

LINDSAY:
Not yet. I kinda like it. But actually, I was thinking back to my hotel room?

SHAWN:
Wow. Uh, well, you know. It's...It's something we could try. I mean, it's not as much fun as making ashtrays with our names on them, but... Yeah. I'm a flexible guy, a sportsman.

LINDSAY:
Good. All right, I'll head back to freshen up. What do you say we meet at 2200 hours?

SHAWN:
Perfect. Oh, I'm so rude. Gus, buddy, would you like to join us?

GUS:
Well, I probably should...

SHAWN:
That sucks. So, 2200 on the dot. I'll be there. (LINDSAY leaves)(whispers to GUS) Dude, what time is 2200 hours? (GUS walks away) Gus. Buddy, help me out. (follows GUS) What is it? Is it, like, 11:00 times two? Buddy!

EXT. LINDSAY'S HOTEL, NIGHT

Light plays on the water in the fountain in front of the hotel. Spandau Ballet's "True" plays.

INT. LINDSAY'S HOTEL ROOM, NIGHT

"True" continues to play. SHAWN and LINDSAY are sitting on a sofa facing each other. SHAWN is hugging a pillow.

LINDSAY:
So, tell me, Shawn. Are you planning on doing psychic police work forever?

SHAWN:
No. No, just until I find the girl of my dreams. And then I'll whisk her off to Carmel, open a small haberdashery. Do some macram√©, maybe. Maybe blow some glass.

LINDSAY:
Hmm. Well, as hot as that sounds, I think the psychic world would miss your talents. Just make sure they appreciate you. After a while, the world tends to take people with our abilities for granted.

SHAWN:
Well, that's awfully easy for you to say. I mean, you've already met your special someone... Your handsome prince. You're serious with somebody, remember?

LINDSAY:
Uh, actually, I recently had a change of heart.

SHAWN:
Really? Would a... Would a certain psychic have anything to do with that?

LINDSAY:
Well, we do have quite a connection.

SHAWN:
We do. It's... It's like our minds are just fused together, you know? I feel like Holly Hunter in Broadcast News, you know, when she's inside William Hurt's head?

LINDSAY:
Okay, let's try it.

They lean closer together and SHAWN moves the pillow aside.

LINDSAY:
I'm thinking of something.

SHAWN:
None. They don't bury the survivors.

LINDSAY:
Yes, exactly.

SHAWN:
You have a favorite color, and I'm seeing... sea foam green.

LINDSAY:
Actually, it's blue, but that is so near the green family.

SHAWN:
Pick a number between one and ten.

LINDSAY:
Eight.

SHAWN:
That's close enough.

They start kissing.

SHAWN:
You totally wanted me to do that.

LINDSAY:
You totally read my mind.

The music swells and they relocate to the bed.

INT. LINDSAY'S HOTEL ROOM, DAY

SHAWN wakes up alone in bed. He looks around the room

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

EXT. STREET, DAY

GUS is heading for the car, talking on his cell.

GUS:
Whoa, slow down. What do you mean she took off... when?

SHAWN:
(closes desk drawer) You know, I don't know when. She tricked me, okay? She clearly wants to take all the credit for herself. Look, just... just meet me over here. (checks receipts for a clue as the phone beeps) Oh, that's Lassie on the other line. I gotta take it.

GUS:
You're dropping me for Lassiter?

SHAWN:
And hurry up!

INT. WAREHOUSE, DAY

LASSITER stands next to SHAWN and GUS.

SHAWN:
You wait till now to call us?

LASSITER:
I called you as soon as I heard. Do you think I want Junior G-man here to beat me to the punch?

The body of a man lies on the floor, gunshot wound in his chest. VICK, JULIET, LINDSAY and EWING are also there.

EWING:
Thank you. Well, it's affirmative. Our counterfeiter. Shot with his own gun. There's signs of a struggle. Checks out as Steven J. Grabinski. His only priors are a couple counts of petty theft and small-time fraud in Washington.

SHAWN looks at the body and sees the scar and earring that LINDSAY had described earlier.

SHAWN:
Damn, she's good.

LINDSAY kneels beside the body and moves her hands along the body, touching it when she reaches the chest.

LASSITER:
Whoa! Touchy! I don't know how you do it in Washington, but here, we don't disturb the body till forensics has a chance to come in, collect some evidence.

VICK:
Lassiter, ease up. We're lucky if our psychic doesn't lick the body. Well, I guess congratulations are in order. We have to hand it to our federal agents here. Though we would have preferred to bring him in and charge him, this case looks pretty much wrapped up.

EWING:
There's no need to congratulate us for doing what is our job. We don't ask for commendation for what is merely our proud honor of servitude to our country. Perhaps just a small hug.

VICK ushers JULIET out of the room.

EWING:
Just an itty-bitty one. I'm serious. Too much? (follows others)

SHAWN and LINDSAY are alone - aside from the forensics team.

SHAWN:
So how'd you sleep? Well, I guess I was right about one thing. It turned out to be a pretty good week for you.

SHAWN walks out and LINDSAY follows.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

HENRY is seated at the table and takes a bite of the small pineapple upside-down cake. SHAWN is air-drumming with utensils.

HENRY:
Look, I'm sorry, Shawn. I don't know what you want me to say to you.

SHAWN:
I don't know either.

HENRY:
You lost a case. You lose. She's on the winning side, you're on the losing side. She's the winner, you're the loser.

SHAWN:
You know, Dad, had I made a list of things I did want to hear, that wouldn't even have made the top eight.

HENRY:
Something is really off with this cake. (spits the cake out) But, Shawn, you want my advice? (SHAWN shakes his head) I think you should quit.

SHAWN:
What?

HENRY:
You should quit. That's what you do. When things get tough, somebody's better than you, you quit.

SHAWN:
Where is this even coming from?

HENRY:
Oh, come on, Shawn, I've got 80 examples sitting on the tip of my tongue. Eighth grade you quit the bassoon when Bobby Nowocinski beat you out for the solo in the winter festival.

SHAWN:
Let me get this straight. You have an example from eighth grade sitting on the tip of your tongue?

HENRY:
Shawn, the point is, a year from now, you won't even be working for the Santa Barbara Police Department.

SHAWN:
You don't know that.

HENRY:
All right, look, Shawn, (stands) now I'm gonna tell you something that you do want to hear. (puts his hands on SHAWN'S shoulders) I accept you for who you are. (cups his face before dropping hands)

SHAWN:
Is that a fact?

HENRY:
That is a fact. You don't have to prove anything to me. I'm gonna let you off the hook. Now, how's that feel? Better? Now you can go ahead, and you can quit this too.

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are walking along the beachfront path on the way to the office. SHAWN is holding a mini pineapple upside-down cake in his hand.

SHAWN:
First of all... and I think I can say this now with a fair amount of certainty... there's definitely something not right about this cake.

They turn and head for the office.

GUS:
Maybe because it was baked with a child's oven.

SHAWN:
We're talking about a deluxe Easy-Bake Oven, Gus. I paid over $300 for it on eBay. This is hardly a toy.

GUS:
Okay, I didn't major in psychology, but I'm gonna guess this doesn't have anything to do with the cake.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry. It's got nothing to do with you or me or my dad or the cake. It's got a little something to do with the cake. But it's mostly about Lindsay showing us up on this case. She's either a crazy-good psychic, or she's just a better detective than me.

GUS:
Hey, I thought you had her back at the hotel when you surprised her with that $500.000 thing.

SHAWN flashes back to the moment when he announced the amount of money he believed had been printed and the look on LINDSAY'S face.

SHAWN:
I did have her. I totally had her. Come on!

SHAWN throws the cake away as he and GUS run to the Echo.

INT. HOTEL, MILDRED'S ROOM, DAY

MILDRED is packing her suitcase.

SHAWN:
Mildred, you kept a record of everything that was said in this investigation. Am I right?

MILDRED:
If someone as little as burped, I got it down.

GUS:
There's a symbol for burp?

SHAWN:
Terrific. I need you to clarify something for me. Two days ago, in the morning, outside the Home Depot center. Ewing and Leikin making small talk. Can you read that back?

MILDRED:
(digs transcript out of suitcase) What was that, 0700 hours?

SHAWN:
No, no, it was 7:00 a. m.

GUS hits SHAWN with his arm.

MILDRED:
Here's something. "EWING: Do you know of a good chocolatier? "Leikin: I had someone in Seattle, specialized in hazelnut praline stuff... very good."

SHAWN:
It was just after that.

MILDRED:
Something about the dye used in public swimming pools to identify urine?

SHAWN:
Nope.

MILDRED:
The musical Wicked?

SHAWN:
No.

MILDRED:
Something about coffee?

SHAWN:
Yes! That's it. Mildred, could you read the coffee thing?

As MILDRED reads, SHAWN remembers that morning.

EXT. SHOPPING PLAZA, DAY

EWING and LINDSAY walk in front of the Santa Barbara crew.

MILDRED: (v.o.)
"EWING: You breached protocol, Leikin. I waited for you outside the hotel, 0630, but you weren't there." "Yeah, sorry, I got up early and went to grab coffee."

INT. HOTEL, MILDRED'S ROOM, DAY

SHAWN:
Mildred, where are Ewing and Leikin now?

MILDRED:
Where I'm supposed to be, catching a chartered flight back to Washington. I'm late.

MILDRED packs the transcript back in her suitcase. GUS scribbles on a notepad.

SHAWN:
Not a problem. We'll give you a ride. We happen to be headed that way.

MILDRED:
That's great.

GUS:
Mildred, here. Say this. (hands MILDRED the pad)

MILDRED:
"Shotgun".

GUS:
(looks at SHAWN) Tough luck, buddy. (makes a dash for the door)

EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC, DAY

EWING and LINDSAY stand by the open door of a private jet. VICK, LASSITER and JULIET are there to say goodbye.

EWING:
Well, folks, you all did a nice job on this investigation. (shakes LASSITER'S hand)(to JULIET) So, uh, you have a MySpace page or something?

LINDSAY heads for the steps just as SHAWN and GUS come running up.

SHAWN:
Whoa! Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. (out of breath) I just wanted to make sure I had an opportunity to congratulate you, you know, personally.

LINDSAY:
Thank you. It's not necessary.

SHAWN:
No, no, no, it is necessary. You did it. You cracked it. I mean, you deserve all the credit. You're amazing. She's an amazing person.

LINDSAY:
Look, Shawn, don't feel too bad. There'll be other cases. (takes her carry-on and walks to the steps)

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, I know. I know. But not for you. You see, it all started when you identified the scar on the jaw line of our counterfeiter, along with his little diamond-stud earring. I mean, I couldn't even draw a hair color. So there's no way that you could do that unless... Unless you'd already seen him before.

LINDSAY:
This is ridiculous.

SHAWN:
Is it? It's not like I'm wearing a giant moose costume. I had a vision you were drinking coffee.

LINDSAY:
Oh, congratulations.

SHAWN:
But not at the hotel. (remembers the receipt from the hotel room) You were driving past one Starbucks, two Starbucks, 17 Starbucks, and ended up all the way in Goleta. On the very same day that Grabinski's Lamborghini was spotted just outside of town in...Anybody? (LASSITER raises his hand) Special?

EWING:
Goleta. (snaps fingers)

SHAWN:
That's right. Goleta. The two of you were partners and you were in touch the whole time. What's more, they were lovers in the night.

MILDRED arrives and sets up her stenograph.

SHAWN:
I didn't think it was possible to fall in love with somebody in the span of five minutes. (flashes back to EWING telling them about how close LINDSAY came to catching the suspect) That's when you met him. You didn't miss him. She had him. She had your bad boy red-handed. Suddenly you were much more interested in combining forces and making a whole lot of money. And it was going well. It was going very well... Until you blew it. You know which moment I'm talking about, right? The one in the hotel room. When you realized he had printed way more than the 50,000 that you'd planned. And the passport? So you called him that morning, you met him at the warehouse. It was you who struggled with him. And it was you who shot him dead. Only then, having your vision that miraculously led everyone here to the crime scene.

LINDSAY:
Oh, come on. I mean, I've seen poor losers before, but this is just sad.

SHAWN:
Your DNA was all over him. But you covered your tracks by touching the body in front of everybody before forensics had a chance to come in and brush it. Or comb it. Braid it. Maybe put it in pigtails.

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
That only leaves one outstanding issue. And that is, where's the rest of the money? Wait a minute. What's happening? (starts acting like his body is spontaneously doing martial arts) What's happening to me? I've heard about this. It's called spontaneous psychic krobmuga. (makes karate sounds and kicks over her carry-on) Oh, my, it's the bag. Something's in the bag! It's bad. It's very bad. And it could be embarrassing.

EWING walks over and takes the bag. He unzips it to reveal the money.

LINDSAY:
(sighs) Well, you were wrong about one thing, Shawn. I didn't sleep with you because you were my enemy. I did it because I really thought we had something.

Everyone raises eyebrows at that revelation.

SHAWN:
Okay. First of all, a little discretion would be nice, all right? I mean, these are...These are my co-workers. And secondly, anything we had, you ruined, because you betrayed your gift, Leikin. You give a bad name to psychics like me who pride themselves on the purity of that gift. There are so many people out there who already doubt what we do. Now you've given 'em all a reason to think that we're fakes. You sicken me...I'm sickened. I mean, sure, I'm still wildly attracted to you on the physical level, but, spiritually and psychically, you're dead to me.

LINDSAY pulls a gun from her purse and pulls SHAWN in front of her as a shield.

JULIET:
Gun!

LASSITER pulls out his gun.

LINDSAY:
I'm taking him and I'm taking the plane.

JULIET pulls her gun. MILDRED pushes her wheeled stenograph at LINDSAY, giving SHAWN a chance to get out of the way. EWING wrestles LINDSAY to the ground in what could be mistaken as a compromising position under other circumstances.

EWING:
This is not what it looks like.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is at her desk finishing the paperwork for the case.

VICK:
(walks over) Okay, they're just processing Ms. Leikin's arrest before we put her back on a plane to Washington. It'd be great if you guys could give me this paperwork as soon as possible.

JULIET:
Got it.

VICK walks away and JULIET looks down the hall. Some low seductive R&B begins to play (think Barry White) as EWING emerges from around the corner, shirtless. He still wears his shoulder holster and carries a white dress shirt in his hand. JULIET gasps as he walks towards her. Her vision becomes misty as imagination takes over. The music stops abruptly as he arrives in front of her desk.

EWING:
Lassiter spilled a cup of coffee on me and right before I was supposed to get on the plane. Thankfully I keep an extra crisp, white shirt on me. Government issue, folds up to the size of my wallet. Fits in my back pocket. Gotta love those boys in the Gadget Tech Department.

JULIET:
Hmm.

EWING walks away and JULIET releases the breath she was holding as she watches him disappear.

Episode 2x04 Zero to Murder in 60 Seconds

1987

EXT. STREET, DAY

"Eye of the Tiger" plays. SHAWN his on his bike and it's decked out with mirrors, reflectors, flags, pinwheels, baseball cards in the spokes and streamers. He's wearing headphones hooked to a Walkman.  GUS looks over from his plain bike and shakes his head before leaning forward to prepare for the race. Down the road, HENRY stands in the middle, raises his arms, and lowers them to start the race. Both boys pedal furiously as HENRY watches critically. GUS wins.

SHAWN:
(turns off music) But how did I lose? My bike's twice as good as his.

HENRY:
Yeah, well you see, that's the thing, Shawn. Sure, your bike looks great with all these ridiculous reflectors and gadgets from years' worth of cereal box tops, but Gus here (claps a hand on GUS' shoulder) focused on what's important: hard work. I'm sorry son, but he just out-pedaled you. Do you understand?

SHAWN:
(lowers headphones) I think so.

GUS rings his bike's bell.

SHAWN:
I got it! I had the wrong song playing that time. Best two out of three.

HENRY puts a hand on SHAWN'S handlebars with a sigh.

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN is sitting at a desk. He looks over his shoulder before pushing backwards in the wheeled office chair. He faces GUS and knocks his chair. GUS looks at him and SHAWN raises an eyebrow.

GUS:
I know what you're trying to do, Shawn. And it's not gonna work. I'm not buying.

SHAWN makes a show of lowering the seat of the chair.

GUS:
Oh, it's on now.

They push the chairs out into the hall.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

They center themselves in the intersection of the halls. SHAWN grabs the armrest of GUS' chair.

SHAWN:
On three. One, two... (starts)

Both backpedal furiously trying to win.

GUS:
Let go of my chair, Shawn. The wheels, they're stuck together! Get off, Shawn!

LASSITER, who had been watching, knocks over SHAWN'S chair, causing them both to fall over.

LASSITER:
Listen, you two...

SHAWN:
Did you see who won?

GUS:
I beat him, didn't I?

SHAWN:
No, no, no. Two out of three.

SHAWN and GUS both get to their feet.

GUS:
Ha! That means I beat him, right?

LASSITER:
Unlike everyone else around here, I'm not fooled by the fact that you... wear grown-up clothes, have mastered the rudimentary levels of communication and, somehow, manage to feed yourselves. I see you for what you are: children. So do me a favor and let the grown-ups do their work.

SHAWN:
(points to elbow) I got a boo-boo.

LASSITER sighs and turns away. GUS elbows SHAWN and they follow the detective.

SHAWN:
Speaking of boo-boos, you wouldn't happen to have any extra unsolved cases lying around, would you?

LASSITER:
Spencer, there is just no easy way to tell you that I consider you a waste of this department's time and energy. (stops and faces them) I guess there was an easy way. But actually I've got less patience for you today than normal. See, I received an invitation to give a presentation at 21-LES. (SHAWN and GUS look at each other) 21st Century Law Enforcement Seminar?

GUS:
(realization) Oh.

SHAWN:
(realization) Oh. Yes. We know that better as "21 Saint Cent-Les".

GUS:
I like to call it 21 Cent Law Info Semin.

LASSITER:
Go ahead, make jokes. (walks away)

SHAWN:
But we just did.

EXT. SBPD, DAY

GUS and SHAWN follow LASSITER outside and down the steps.

LASSITER:
You see, kids, I will be presenting the cutting edge technology. Modern tools for the new detective. We're talking back-scatter x- ray scanning, DNA sampling, sonic weaponry, you name it, I am... (stops and looks at his empty parking space) That's weird. I could have sworn that I... I don't believe it.

GUS:
Don't believe what?

LASSITER:
My car, it's gone. It was right there. (points)  It's... It's been stolen. Who would dare steal my car?

SHAWN:
Well, here's the good news. It'll make for an amusing anecdote during your presentation at 21 Saint Cent-Les.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER, SHAWN and GUS re-enter the station.

LASSITER:
All right, just keep your mouth shut. I don't want people to think anything's wrong. (greets passing officers) Morning, O'Connell. Schwartz. Dobson. Just rapping with the fellas, shooting the breeze.

SHAWN:
Sweet, now they'll just think it's 1974.

LASSITER:
(stops) Wait a minute. Is... is this a prank? Did you take my car? Is this some sort of "punking"?

SHAWN:
To think that we would stoop so low as to tamper with police-issued property, and defile the institution that is the Santa Barbara police department, is an affront to our honor. I for one, am greatly offended.

GUS:
And I, for two.

LASSITER:
I just don't see how this could have happened. (walks between them)

GUS:
Did you?

SHAWN:
(mouths) No.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER sits behind his desk and SHAWN and GUS follow him in. SHAWN sees a partial tag on LASSITER'S key ring that reads "Parking".

SHAWN:
Wait! I'm getting something.

GUS:
What, Shawn? What is it?

SHAWN:
It's a trace on Lassie's car. It's faint, but clear. You were recently somewhere where the security of your car was compromised. I'm sensing someplace posh. Surprisingly upscale for someone on half a civil servant's salary.

LASSITER:
As it happens, I dined at a very exclusive restaurant last night.

SHAWN:
The type of restaurant one would take a date to? Is old Lassie back in the game?

LASSITER:
It is none of your business with whom I spend my personal time.

SHAWN:
Now you have to dish. Is she blonde?

GUS:
Brunette?

SHAWN:
Mail order?

GUS:
You sly dog.

SHAWN gives a dirty little laugh.

LASSITER:
Please, I'm not gonna engage in some sort of juvenile masculinity contest.

SHAWN:
He went by himself.

GUS:
Yeah.

LASSITER:
(stands) Her name was Polly Smith. 324 Sycamore Lane. We kissed. Ask her.

SHAWN:
Polly Smith?

SHAWN looks at GUS and they shake their heads doubtfully.

SHAWN:
Whoa! (puts a hand to his head) Something happened at that restaurant that led to your car being stolen. I'm sensing red coats and accents.

GUS:
The British?

SHAWN:
No. The valets. Check the valet that parked your car. He may have used the old "key in the putty" trick to get an impression.

LASSITER:
Of course, that would have been my first deduction, had I not been overcoming this blatant violation. (picks up car keys) I'm gonna get right over there.

GUS puts a hand on LASSITER'S arm.

SHAWN:
No-o, No car, remember?

They laugh.

LASSITER:
You guys are so funny. Oh, guess what. I just got a new car. (holds up badge) Yours.

INT. ECHO, DAY

GUS and SHAWN are sitting in the back seat.

GUS:
Maybe we had a little too much fun with him.

LASSITER pushes the driver's seat back, nearly forcing SHAWN'S knees to his chest.

SHAWN:
Maybe.

LASSITER starts the car. SHAWN taps him on the shoulder and LASSITER turns his head.

SHAWN:
I have to pee-pee.

LASSITER drives away.

INT. RESTAURANT, KITCHEN, DAY

LASSITER pushes the doors open and strides in. GUS and SHAWN follow. A man in a suit, the MAITRE D', confronts LASSITER.

MAITRE D:
May I help you, gentleman?

LASSITER:
(shows badge) The theft of police property has occurred. I have reason to believe the guilty party works here.

MAITRE D:
Oh, dear. Well, rest assured you have our complete cooperation. I only ask that you keep your investigation under wraps. You know, for appearance sake.

LASSITER:
Noted. Now, I'm gonna need to sequester your main dining room interview your entire valet staff, and possibly your busboys.

MAITRE D:
One moment. (walks away)

LASSITER:
(turns to SHAWN and GUS) Yeah, he's gonna be a problem.

SHAWN:
I don't know. He seemed pretty cooperative.

LASSITER:
Your work here is done. I'll get my car back soon enough. Here. (tosses the keys to GUS) But I'm warning you, if word of this little incident gets out of the station, I will start making things very difficult for you down there.

SHAWN:
You're saying you haven't even been trying all this time?

LASSITER:
Good-bye.

SHAWN and GUS walk out of the kitchen.

INT. RESTAURANT, DINING ROOM, DAY

GUS and SHAWN walk past the bar to the dining room.

SHAWN:
He's not gonna get anywhere talking to those valets. They have a very strict code.

GUS:
I still think you're thinking about the British.

SHAWN:
May have to roll my sleeves up for this one, Gus. (looks to the side) Actually, I may have to take off my entire shirt.

GUS:
Please don't.

SHAWN points to the beautiful HOSTESS.

GUS:
Oh, later.

They fist bump and GUS leaves. SHAWN walks over to the hostess. Her nametag reads CHELSEA.

SHAWN:
Hi there. My name is Shawn Spencer. I'm the head psychic for the Santa Barbara police department. And I may need to get a statement from you. More specifically, the word "yes".

CHELSEA:
(points to sign on the wall) Nice try. But I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.

SHAWN looks into her purse and sees pamphlets regarding senior discounts and the Santa Barbara Miniatures Museum.

SHAWN:
That's all right. If my parents were visiting, I probably wouldn't wanna waste time meeting handsome new strangers either. Regardless of how smart or interesting they might be.

CHELSEA:
My parents are visiting. That was pretty impressive. You really are psychic. Sorry, I thought you were just hitting on me.

SHAWN:
Oh, I'm actually much more interested in going out with your parents. I love the Miniatures Museum.

They laugh lightly.

CHELSEA:
What was it you need to ask me about?

SHAWN:
Do you recall any uh... suspicious behavior from any of the valets on duty last night?

CHELSEA:
Now that you mention it, we had a new guy who started yesterday, but didn't show up this morning.

SHAWN:
Bingo. Gonna need a name and a phone number.

CHELSEA:
Well, of course. (starts writing on PostIt) And then... I'll give you the information about the valet. (gives SHAWN the paper and winks)

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN is sitting on his Norton as he talks to GUS on his cell.

SHAWN:
Get this. The valet's number is actually a number to a pay phone outside of a warehouse. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if it looks like the warehouse from Blue City, Gus. You're the only one that remembers that movie. What, are you insane? Way more people saw From the Hip than Blue City... Look, I'm not gonna talk Judd Nelson right now. No, just... just meet me at the station in an hour. Thank you.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

GUS enters the station. SHAWN is already there.

GUS:
A warehouse? Sweet! (takes credit card from SHAWN and pockets it) There's always something happening on the DL inside a warehouse. You staked it out, right? I know you staked it out.

SHAWN:
Oh, it got staked. Stook. Staken? Staked, right?

GUS:
Right. That's...

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah. It got staked.

GUS:
You found out what happened to Lassiter's car?

SHAWN:
A whole bunch of cars go in, but only boxes full of car parts come out. Dude, it's a chop shop.

GUS:
That's big.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK, LASSITER and JULIET are sitting at VICK'S desk looking off to the side where SHAWN is having a "vision".

SHAWN:
Victims. I see victims everywhere! It's horrible! (spins in the chair) Sawed-off parts strewn about. Fluids spraying in every direction.

VICK:
Oh, dear God!

JULIET:
Are we talking about a serial killer?

SHAWN:
I can see the victims' names. Accord! Look out!

GUS:
Get outta there!

SHAWN:
Escalade, don't let him in the door. Oh, Camry, you were too young to go!

JULIET:
Are we talking about cars?

LASSITER:
(pointedly) Stolen cars?

SHAWN:
(pushes the chair backwards) The signal's too strong. (puts his hands down on the printer) I'm getting "chopsticks". "Chopped salad"?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(chops his hands on the top of the printer before pulling out the paper drawer) "Chop suey"? (starts back to the desk)

GUS:
Good God!

SHAWN:
"Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch". Does that mean anything to you? "Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch".

JULIET:
Chop shop! It's a chop shop.

SHAWN:
Yes! And... and I see a warehouse. And cargo containers. And a street sign. And a little mouse named Algernon in a maze.

JULES:
Flower Street!

VICK:
Flower Street. That's down by the tracks. We better check this out. (to SHAWN) You know you just bought that, right?

VICK, JULIET and LASSITER leave the office as SHAWN looks down at the bits of printer in his lap

INT. WAREHOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS watch as two officers place a man in the back of a patrol car. SHAWN sees the man give a small knowing smile right before he's driven away. VICK walks over to them.

VICK:
Looks like a slam dunk, Mr. Spencer. Wally there is the ringleader. And all the evidence we need to take him down is right here. I mean, stolen parts, serial numbers, shipment logs, you name it.

SHAWN:
No need to thank me, Chief. Just glad to help.

VICK reaches out to shake GUS' hand. GUS puts his hands up.

SHAWN:
Don't thank him either.

VICK:
Well, if I can't thank you I can't pay you.

GUS:
Our pleasure. (shakes VICK'S hand)

SHAWN:
(shakes VICK'S hand) Oh, you're very welcome. You are.

VICK:
You know, this ring was responsible for hundreds of car thefts around town. Wally had operatives in places... mechanics, valets, car wash attendants, all copying people's keys and then stealing their cars from different locations.

GUS:
Does it say anything in there about them stealing loose change or switching the presets on radios? 'Cause that happens to me all the time.

SHAWN:
Okay, Gus. Go ahead and put your aluminum foil hat back on.

GUS:
I'm not paranoid, Shawn. It happens.

VICK:
Anyway, I believe this is a department record for the fastest bust ever in a case this size. Truly your most efficient work. (applauds)

The officers in the warehouse join VICK in applauding.

OFFICER 1:
Nice work, boys.

OFFICER 2:
Good work, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Oh, stop. That's so unnecessary.

LASSITER comes up behind them and clamps a hand on their necks and walks them away from the others.

LASSITER:
You know, I couldn't help but notice that a certain vehicle belonging to a certain head detective just happens to not be here.

SHAWN:
Lassie, we had the boys from crime scene move your car up the street right before you and the Chief arrived. You're in the clear, tiger.

LASSITER:
Thanks. (walks back inside)

SHAWN:
Although... today is a street sweeping day. Did we park on the east side or the west side of the street?

GUS:
North side.

SHAWN:
No, no, no. It wasn't the north side.

GUS:
Yes, it was. I'd know, Shawn. I'm good with directions. You're not.

SHAWN:
Gus, you have the bearings of a wounded bumblebee. Why would...

A tow-truck passes in front of them with LASSITER'S car.

SHAWN:
Uh-oh.

GUS:
We need to get out of here.

INT. RESTAURANT, DINING ROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN is sitting with CHELSEA on a date.

CHELSEA:
Well, you're certainly a unique guy, Shawn. A guy who calls the day he gets the number. And brings flowers.

SHAWN:
I stole the flowers. From table one. They're fake, and they smell vaguely of creamy pesto, but I'm pretty sure it's the thought that counts.

CHELSEA:
And you're good enough to come and meet me here my last free night before my parents arrive.

SHAWN:
Oh, wrapping up this case was a lot easier than I thought. (holds up strawberry) And this is one of the biggest strawberries I've ever seen.

CHELSEA:
Impressive. I've been here all day. So... what do you say we take our dessert back to my place? (leans in seductively)

SHAWN:
I say yes.

They kiss.

SHAWN:
Was this too easy?

CHELSEA:
I beg your pardon?

SHAWN:
Nothing. I'm sorry. Never mind.

They kiss again.

SHAWN:
I can't believe how quickly I nailed this. Am I really this good?

CHELSEA:
Excuse me?

SHAWN:
I mean, is it possible that... No. No, nothing like this has ever happened before.

CHELSEA:
And nothing's going to happen tonight either. How dare you think that I'm easy? Good-bye. (stands and walks away)

SHAWN:
What... no. No, no, no. I'm not talking about you. This is... this is something much worse. This is the first time I've been wrong about a case.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, NIGHT

GUS is picking up magazines as SHAWN talks. He packs them and other items into a bag.

SHAWN:
Gus, I'm telling you, it was too easy. Why would this Wally guy slip up by stealing a detective's car from in front of a police station? That doesn't make any sense.

GUS:
Sure it does. One of his guys got sloppy.

SHAWN:
Gus, I'm pretty sure I saw him smile as they loaded him into the squad car. What, he thinks going to prison is dope? No, come on. I think I solved the crime I was supposed to solve. Not the crime I should've solved.

GUS:
Okay, you're not making any sense. And I happen to be busy, so if you don't mind?

SHAWN:
What are you doing? What is this? What, are you going somewhere?

GUS:
Yes, actually, I am. I finally have a free weekend. (holds up award) Which means I get to use the Spa Utopia package I won for being top sales rep. It comes complete with Town Car and driver.

SHAWN:
Gus, you've been bragging about that award for over a year. Why go now?

GUS:
Maybe I kept pushing it back because I was always working a second job. Like when I had to enter a Civil War reenactment, or when I was protecting a sorority of pajama-clad coeds.

SHAWN:
You're actually complaining about that?

GUS:
No, I'm not. But let's not forget about the entire week I gave up riding shotgun to a cat, which, by the way, was not a boy cat at all. That's some serious stress, Shawn. I have to get a deep-tissue massage to work out all the knots in my back. I call the big one "Little Shawn".

SHAWN:
Okay, that's the creepiest thing anyone's ever said to me.

GUS:
They have a blind masseuse up there named Gloria. I hear she works wonders. I can't wait.

SHAWN:
(sits) What is it with you and the blind? I remember you went crazy for that blind sculptor that did your bust.

GUS:
That was Lionel Richie in the video for Hello.

SHAWN:
Great. Now I'm gonna have that song stuck in my head.

GUS:
Good. Good-bye, Shawn. (puts bag over shoulder and leaves)

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN hurries into VICK'S office.

SHAWN:
Chief! We gotta reopen the chop shop case. I'm pretty sure we missed something.

VICK:
First of all, "we" don't decide to reopen cases. I do.

SHAWN:
That's what I meant.

LASSITER enters the office

LASSITER:
Morning, Chief. (hands her a document)

VICK:
Morning.

LASSITER uses his key remote to set his car alarm.

VICK:
Uh, Lassiter, Mr. Spencer seems to think we might have missed something in the chop shop case.

LASSITER:
No. No, that's an open-and-shut case if ever I've seen one.

SHAWN opens his mouth, ready to argue, but VICK cuts him off.

VICK:
Sorry, Mr. Spencer, but if you want to reopen the case, you're gonna need to come up with some concrete evidence. We don't devote department resources to personal whims.

JULIET enters, excited.

JULIET:
Carlton, I finished the PowerPoint slides for your 21-LES presentation.

LASSITER takes the paper from her.

VICK:
(to SHAWN) This is official department business?

LASSITER:
Oh, you're right, Helvetica is a much better font.

JULIET:
I know. See how the M in "double murder suicide" just jumps off the page?

LASSITER hands the sheet over to VICK.

VICK:
Okay.

SHAWN:
Is there anyone left that I can actually speak to about this case?

INT. PRISON, VISITORS' ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is visiting with WALLY, talking with him via the telephone.

SHAWN:
Like I said, there's still quite a few unanswered questions.

WALLY:
Well, what can I say? You guys got me fair and square.

SHAWN:
That's just it. What kind of chop shop artist steals a cop's car and doesn't chop it up? It's almost like you wanted to leave a trail.

WALLY:
Leave a trail, don't leave a trail, wouldn't do any good. You guys caught me quick. Snap! Mind of a cheetah. I was like, "What?" Cops are like, "Wham! Miranda."

SHAWN:
Yeah, well, there's still some questions. For instance, why haven't you posted bail, Wally?

WALLY:
Oh, it's all good. You know, I'm gonna just do my time with good behavior, and go on with my life. Till then, I'm like, "My bad!" The court's like, "Get in that cell". Justice.

SHAWN:
Okay. Let's try this again.

GUARD:
Prisoner 1906, visiting time is over.

WALLY:
Gotta go.

WALLY hangs up the phone and raises his fist to the window before standing and walking away. SHAWN shakes his head and hangs up the phone before walking to the desk and signing out. While doing so, he notices that WALLY had only one visitor - three times: Jonny G.

INT. SPA, RECEPTION, DAY

GUS tightens the belt on his robe as he follows a male EMPLOYEE to the waiting area.

EMPLOYEE:
Your massage therapist will be right with you, Mr. Guster. In the meantime, please relax. And hydrate.

GUS:
Thank you.

GUS sits in a comfortable chair as the EMPLOYEE walks away. The man on the chair behind him accidentally sprays him while hydrating.

GUS:
(turns around) Excuse me. Excuse me, do you mind?

The man turns around and it's SHAWN.

GUS:
(loudly) Shawn, what are you doing here? (to woman in next chair) Sorry. (whispers) Shawn, what are you doing here?

SHAWN:
Trust me. The way today's going, I need to relax too. I can't get the Chief to reopen the case.

GUS:
I already... (the woman leaves) I already told you I'm not helping you either.

SHAWN:
You will when you hear this.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I visited Wally. In prison.

GUS:
You went to the pen?

SHAWN:
I went to the joint.

GUS:
You went to the clink?

SHAWN:
According to the visitors' log, the only other person who dropped by to see Wally was Jonny G. Who turns out to be the Jonny G. of Jonny G.'s Bling it On Custom Auto Shop.

GUS:
So all he's guilty of is a bad pun?

SHAWN:
Hardly. First Wally gets arrested for running a chop shop, then he gets visited by Jonny G., who works in custom auto parts. Adds a whole new angle to the case, Gus. Look, is Jonny G. dirty too? What's the G stand for? Is Wally working for him? What other criminal nonsense are they up to? Man, we may have just uncovered the tip of the iceberg here.

GUS:
That's all you've got?

SHAWN:
That... and this. (uses the spray on his face) It burns.

GUS:
Sitting here listening to you right now, Little Shawn just got bigger. (turns back on SHAWN)

SHAWN:
I beg your pardon.

GUS:
No thanks. (crosses arms)

SHAWN:
Fine. (turns around and crosses arms) What time are you seeing that blind chick?

GUS:
Gloria can't see me.

SHAWN:
Dude, I know how being blind works.

GUS:
(turns around) I mean she's booked, Shawn. I had to book with this girl named Kelly. I hope she's good.

MAN:
Mr. Guster.

SHAWN and GUS look up to see a large, muscular black man in a tank top.

MAN:
Are you ready for your massage? (cracks neck)

GUS:
Kelly?

KEL:
Call me Kel.

GUS:
Um, you know what, Kel? (stands) I forgot I have another appointment I have to go to. Uh, thanks for your time.

SHAWN follows GUS out of the room.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Yo. (peeks around GUS back at KEL) Dude. That dude's shoulders looked like two little baby heads.

GUS:
I know. Okay, I'll help. But I must be back in two hours. That's when I booked the isolation chamber.

SHAWN:
Sweet. We'll take your town car. (takes off robe) You're not naked under there, are you?

GUS:
Naked and unashamed.

SHAWN:
Man! I'll be outside.

SHAWN heads outside

INT. BLING IT ON, GARAGE, DAY

GUS and SHAWN enter the garage.

GUS:
How are we gonna get this information out of Jonny G.?

SHAWN:
The dude thinks we're customers, Gus. It's a perfect cover.

GUS:
I don't get it. Who wastes money tricking out a car? It's frivolous and ridiculous. Not to mention it compromises the integrity of the vehicle.

SHAWN sees the serial numbers of the parts lying out in full view. A white man with a shaved head wearing large gold chains struts over.

MAN:
Yo, Shawn! Yo, lookin' good, man. Wassup, homie? (shakes SHAWN'S hand)

SHAWN:
Jonny G., how are ya?

JONNY G:
I'm good, man.

SHAWN:
This is my friend, Ovaltine Jenkins.

JONNY G:
Oh, respect, a'ight? What's up, O? (takes GUS' hand and pulls him into a man hug with a back slap)

GUS:
What's happening?

JONNY G:
Peace, man. Yo, check it out. Your ride is fresh to death. Always do the last checks myself, you know what I mean? Just to make sure it meets specs. You know what I mean?

SHAWN and GUS nod and smile knowingly.

SHAWN:
I do know what you mean.

JONNY G:
You know what I mean?

JONNY G. shakes GUS' hand and gives him another back slap. When they pull apart, they "tickle" the other's open palm as they make a trilling sound. After JONNY G. Leaves, GUS turns to SHAWN, no longer smiling.

GUS:
What ride?

JONNY G:
This one.

JONNY G and an employee lift a tarp off a car to reveal the Echo, newly tricked-out and painted with yellow flames along the front and hood.

GUS:
My car! Shawn!

SHAWN pits is arms out to his sides in a "ta-da" gesture.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) I told you it was the perfect cover. (to JONNY G) That is fresh to death! (laughs)

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN drives the car down the road, hip-hop playing.

INT. ECHO, DAY

GUS:
This is a company car, Shawn. I have to visit clients in this.

SHAWN:
Would you relax?

GUS:
I can't believe you spent all our money from the chop shop case on this. What? You couldn't find any magic beans?

SHAWN:
A "Jack and the Beanstalk" reference? Really?

GUS:
You wasted our money.

SHAWN:
I reinvested it in the business, Gus. Once we figure out what's up with Jonny G.'s shop and re-solve the case, we'll get another check.

GUS:
And you want to know what we are going to do with it?

SHAWN:
Party like it's 1999.

GUS:
No, we're gonna...

SHAWN:
Party.

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
Karamu?

GUS:
No!

SHAWN:
Fiesta?

GUS:
We're gonna spend that money turning my car back to the way it was.

SHAWN:
All right. But I still don't see why you won't drive it like this.

GUS:
Because it's embarrassing.

SHAWN:
Embarrassing? Dude, this is sweet. This is fresh to death. You won't enjoy it, I will.

SHAWN turns the music up and jerks his head to the music. A yellow convertible pulls up beside them with two beautiful young ladies inside.

SHAWN:
What's up, ladies?

GIRL 1:
Nice ride.

GIRL 2:
That's hot.

GUS:
Thank you.

The ladies drive away.

SHAWN:
(leans out the window) You're hot! You are so hot! (smiles at GUS)

GUS:
Get out of my seat.

SHAWN:
You said you didn't want to drive.

GUS:
It's my ride, Shawn. I'm driving.

SHAWN:
Yeah.

They get out of the car and switch places.

SHAWN:
Just get us to the station. I gotta convince the Chief to let us snoop around Jonny G.'s operations.

A police siren wails and a patrol car pulls up behind them.

GUS:
What now?

GUS reaches over to the glove compartment as BUZZ gets out of the patrol car. He walks over and bends down by the driver's side window.

BUZZ:
I'm gonna need your license and regis... (turns and sees who it is) I... I didn't know it was you guys. Sorry, but in this car, you just happen to fit a profile. I'm really sorry to bother you guys. (a German Shepherd jumps up on the door, barking) Mauler! Heel! Heel! (the dog gets down) Now I'm really, really sorry. He's just a trainee for K9 unit. Obviously, he's not gonna make it. Sorry again, fellas. And Gus? Mauler barks at all cars. Not just blue ones.

As BUZZ is talking, Mauler sniffs the hubcaps.

GUS:
Uh-huh.

BUZZ leaves.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET rushes in with a package and sets it on her desk.

JULIET:
Carlton, it's here!

LASSITER:
(rushes over) Is this the new nanomaterial vest we ordered for 21-LES?

JULIET:
Yes, it's gonna kill. (takes out pamphlet) "The KEV-TEK 7000 is made with nanomaterial polymers that give it enough strength to stop a tank mortar shell." I can't wait to try it out. (pulls it out and holds it against her body)

LASSITER:
Oh, no, no, no. Last time, you got to be incapacitated by the sonic gun. Now it's my turn.

LASSITER grabs the vest from JULIET and she grabs it back.

LASSITER:
Let go, O'Hara.

LASSITER takes it again and they begin a tug-of-war over the vest.

JULIET:
Oh, come on.

LASSITER:
Drop it!

JULIET:
Just let me try it...

VICK strides out of her office towards the two detectives.

VICK:
You know I've had just about enough of the two of you. You can both be shot. Just sign the waivers.

They both drop the vest. There is a "cuckoo" and they turn to see SHAWN and GUS enter. SHAWN continues to "cuckoo" as he walks up beside JULIET.

SHAWN:
Sonny was a cuckoo bird. Clearly he was cuckoo for something.

VICK:
Cocoa Puffs.

SHAWN:
Exactly.

GUS:
I always thought it was Cuckoo Puffs.

SHAWN:
No. Sonny is cuckoo for the puffs, which are cocoa. That's why the milk turns all brown and chocolatey.

GUS:
Oh. I was never allowed to eat that stuff when I was a kid. That's why I don't have any cavities.

VICK:
(clears throat) So, are we having cereal?

SHAWN:
Yes. But I'm getting more. (puts hand to head) 9459687, 7635452, 250960.

JULIET writes down the numbers as SHAWN speaks.

JULIET:
Are these serial numbers?

SHAWN:
Yes, but there's more. I see shiny rims, spoilers, hammered rims...

LASSITER:
Spencer, is this about the chop shop? 'Cause we told you the case is closed.

VICK:
Now, hold on. This is very specific information. (sighs) O'Hara, run the numbers by the crime lab, just to make sure we didn't miss anything in the sweep. And you better not be wasting department time, Mr. Spencer. Because if you are, we'll be using these new vests on you.

LASSITER:
That's a great idea.

VICK:
Thank you.

LASSITER:
Because that way, it's a plus for me whether they work or fail.

SHAWN picks up the vest as JULIET, VICK and LASSITER leave.

INT. ECHO, DAY

GUS is behind the wheel.

GUS:
It better not take long for Juliet to run those numbers.

SHAWN:
It won't.

GUS:
I already missed all of yesterday on this already-solved case. This is my last day to enjoy my vacation. You don't realize how much stress I've been on these past few... (stops at intersection and SHAWN turns up radio) I'm not playing, Shawn. I never get to do anything for myself. (doesn't see convertible with cute women eying the car) I'm getting that massage. (SHAWN sees the women and lowers the radio) And yes, I'll be naked and unashamed under my robe while they rub Little Shawn down!

SHAWN covers his smile. The two women exchange glances, laugh and pull away. GUS sees them too late and sticks his head out the window.

GUS:
(shouts) Wait! It wasn't like that!

GUS slaps the wheel and grunts before driving on. SHAWN'S cell rings.

SHAWN:
(answers phone) Jules, what do you got on those serial numbers?

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is standing at her desk

JULIET:
Well, the good news is, they tracked them to car parts. The bad news is, the parts were purchased legitimately for Bling it On. And the even worse news is that Lassiter wants to know what size vest you wear.

SHAWN:
Very funny. Thanks for making my life more challenging. (ends call)

GUS:
The car parts at the shop were legit?

SHAWN:
Looks that way. There must be something else going on down there that we're missing, besides selling stolen car parts. We gotta get back down there and look for clues.

GUS:
I don't know about you, but I'm still on vacation.

SHAWN looks at the dashboard and pulls out the wires from underneath the radio/electronics area.

SHAWN:
Looks like something's wrong with your in-dash DVD navigation and integrated surround sound system.

GUS:
That was my speedometer. Now I can't see how fast I'm going.

SHAWN:
Regardless, we've gotta take it back to Jonny G. to fix.

INT. BLING IT ON, GARAGE, DAY

GUS and SHAWN enter the garage and approach one of the mechanics who is holding a clipboard.

SHAWN:
Hey, dude. Is Jonny G. around?

MECHANIC:
Uh, don't know. We've been busy.

SHAWN:
What you working on there?

MECHANIC:
Getting this fleet ready to ship to Arizona.

The MECHANIC lowers the clipboard and SHAWN reads it upside-down.

SHAWN:
Okay, thanks. (walk away) (to GUS) And stealth mode.

INT. BLING IT ON, OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN opens the door slowly and peeks around. Once he's sure it's empty, he enters. GUS closes the door cautiously.

GUS:
What are we looking for, anyway?

SHAWN:
Anything that points to criminal activity. (picks up day book from desk) You know,  a white cloth sack with a green dollar sign. A red barrel labeled "TNT." An anvil. Anything. (turns to computer)

GUS:
(takes a rim from a shelf) Check this out.

SHAWN:
What, you already have something? The point of those examples was to imply it wouldn't be so obvious.

GUS:
(plays with rim) Look how light it is.

SHAWN:
Awesome. Flavor Flav can wear it around his neck.

GUS:
Flav wears clocks, not rims, Shawn.

SHAWN'S cell rings. He makes a face as he answers it.

GUS:
(whispers) Why don't you put your phone on vibrate? (goes to door)

SHAWN:
(answers phone) Dad, this is not a good... Okay, relax. I will be right there. (ends call) We gotta go.

GUS:
Go? We either need to be working on this case, or I need to be back on my vacation.

SHAWN:
He said he needed me there immediately. I've never heard him sound this urgent. I hope everything's okay.

They sneak out of the office.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, YARD, DAY

HENRY slaps a fish on the picnic table.

HENRY:
Here. Scale.

SHAWN and GUS are standing on the porch.

SHAWN:
This was the urgent emergency?

HENRY:
Yeah. Gotta get these on the grill before it's too late.

SHAWN walks over to HENRY.

SHAWN:
I can't believe you had me rush down here for this, Dad. I thought something was actually wrong with you. What's wrong with you?

HENRY:
You remember how to scale, don't you, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Yes, I remember how to scale. You only made me do it 1000 times as a kid. A kid who didn't believe in animal cruelty, by the way.

On the porch, GUS makes faces as HENRY scales the fish.

HENRY:
Those animals would've killed you dead, given the means. All right, you scrape the scales, you don't bruise the flesh, you make an incision around the gill, and you fillet...

SHAWN:
Down the spine.

HENRY:
Very good. You do remember. And Gus, you remember... (GUS gags and runs inside) where the bathroom is.

SHAWN:
You're taking me away from very important work right now. (puts on apron) I'll have you know I'm on the verge of uncovering something big, really big. Huge. Did you ever have a case you couldn't crack? (starts scaling)

HENRY:
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Of course. More than a few. But a good detective learns the most when he doesn't get the bad guy.

SHAWN:
No, I got the bad guy.

HENRY:
Oh, well, sometimes he gets off. But a good detective doesn't let that get him down.

SHAWN:
No, he's still in jail. Matter of fact, Chief Vick even says it's my best work.

HENRY:
All right, then what's the problem?

SHAWN:
It doesn't feel like my best work, you know? It feels too easy. Did you ever have that problem?

GUS comes back outside. HENRY takes a knife to the fish's head sending GUS back inside.

HENRY:
No, Shawn, I don't recall any champagne problems like things being... too easy.

SHAWN:
I don't know, I guess... I just imagined my best work would be more complicated, you know? More... Intricate, important, and... Just more, you know, more.

HENRY:
As always, you go after something for the flash, for the excitement. And when you finally get it, you're never satisfied. It always needs something more.

SHAWN:
That is categorically untrue.

HENRY:
Your best case, what does it need? It needs more excitement. Your first bike, what did it need? More reflectors... Well, Shawn, did you ever stop and think that maybe it's your expectations that need to change? Son, look at me. Look, Shawn. Sometimes, a case... is just a case.

SHAWN flashes on the moment when Mauler barked at the wheels of the Echo.

SHAWN:
Wait a second. Wait a second. I just figured it out.

HENRY:
Wait, wait, don't...Shawn, don't do this.

SHAWN:
Oh, this is much bigger than we thought. And I was right all along.

HENRY:
Shawn, don't you dare... don't you dare learn a wrong lesson while I'm trying to teach you a right lesson!

SHAWN flashes on GUS and the light rims as well as the MECHANIC telling them they were readying a shipment for Arizona. He starts jumping up and down in excitement.

HENRY:
Shawn, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop trying to figure it out. Stop jumping!

GUS rejoins them.

SHAWN:
(pulls off apron) I can't help it! It all makes sense! Gus, we gotta go! I'll explain on the way. (SHAWN runs for the door)

HENRY:
Shawn, Shawn! (SHAWN stops) You should be happy with a job well done, regardless of the excitement that it produces.

SHAWN:
Is that it?

HENRY:
Yeah, that's it.

SHAWN leaves. GUS starts to follow but sees HENRY trying to stretch his shoulder.

GUS:
Is it a tight knot right under the shoulder blade?

HENRY:
Yeah, how'd you know?

SHAWN:
(from inside the house) Gus!

GUS leaves.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY, DAY

SHAWN comes out the side door followed by GUS.

SHAWN:
Jonny G. is smuggling drugs out of state inside a car parts. That's why those rims at the office were so light, dude. They were hollow! And that's how he gets the drugs out. And some of that residue must've gotten on your car, which is why that police dog went crazy barking at the wheels.

GUS:
That's what Wally's been covering for all along. He's just a fall guy. Jonny G.'s running the real operation.

They get into the Echo.

INT. ECHO, DAY

They fasten their seatbelts.

SHAWN:
Drug trafficking. We need to make it back to that shop before the evidence leaves for Arizona. Let's go!

GUS drives off.

INT. BLING IT ON, GARAGE, DAY

GUS and SHAWN enter the garage and no one's there.

SHAWN:
Damn it, we're too late.

GUS:
(looks to the side) Somebody's here.

They run over to a car on a raised platform and see who's inside.

SHAWN:
(mouths) No.

SHAWN:
Jonny G.!

They wave their arms to get his attention as the windows are closed. SHAWN finds the control for the lift and lowers the car. JONNY G. is lying in the driver's seat, head back, eyes closed. SHAWN taps on the window. When there's no reaction, they scream, realizing he's dead. SHAWN opens the door and they peer at the body.

SHAWN:
Dude! His foot is still on the accelerator.

They both start giggling.

GUS:
(laughing) Stop! This isn't funny.

SHAWN:
(laughing) You stop.

GUS:
(laughing) I can't!

SHAWN sees a canister between the seats still expelling gas.

SHAWN:
(laughing) The nitrous oxide canister's open.

GUS:
(laughing) Laughing gas? That stuff is deadly in high doses.

SHAWN:
(laughing) At least we know what the cause of death is.

INT. PRISON, VISITORS' ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS hold the phone between them as they talk with WALLY.

WALLY:
I can't believe Jonny G. went out like that.

GUS:
The police suspect foul play. But so far, they have no leads.

WALLY:
All while I was on lockdown? Guess I ended up with a better sentence than Jonny G. did. (points to forehead) Irony.

SHAWN:
We still have a few questions. What do you know about a shipment of custom cars on its way to... Arizona?

WALLY:
We were partners, but Jonny G. was involved in a lot of stuff I didn't know about. If I asked questions, he'd be like, "None of your..." I'd be like, "Okay." Relegate.

GUS:
So... so... you're saying you weren't involved with the custom car shop at all?

WALLY:
I'm saying I was just a front man for the chop shop. And now I'm doing my time, but when I get out, crime's gonna be like, "Come out and play, Wally. Come on." I'm be like, "No. Wally doesn't live here anymore." Re-assimilated.

GUARD:
Time's up.

WALLY kisses his first two fingers and presses them against the window. GUS hesitantly mirrors the action, but WALLY is already standing and walking away. He looks over his shoulder and SHAWN catches that same sly smile as when he was taken away in the patrol car. A guard escorts WALLY from the room.

SHAWN:
(whispers into the phone) Dude. I'm starting to think I was wrong about Wally.

GUS:
(whispers into phone) When? The first time or the second time?

SHAWN:
(whispers into phone) Both. I think he's the mastermind behind this whole drug thing and Jonny G.'s murder.

GUS:
(whispers into phone) But Wally was in jail when Jonny G. died.

SHAWN:
(whispers into phone) Yeah. He made sure of that. (realizes he's talking into a phone) This is a little awkward.

GUS:
Yeah. Let's get outta here.

GUS hangs up the phone and they get up and leave.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN paces the floor, squeaky frog in hand.

SHAWN:
Wally made it easy for us to catch him because he wanted to get thrown in jail. That way, he'd be locked up when he murdered Jonny G.

GUS:
(looks up from computer) Which would give him the perfect alibi.

SHAWN:
With Jonny G. out of the way, Wally assumes sole control of the custom car shop.

GUS:
And the secret drug operation.

SHAWN:
(British accent) Hello, motive, my old friend.

GUS:
Get this. According to public court records, Wally posted bail this morning.

SHAWN:
Why wait until now? (realizes) Dude, because the big drug deal goes down today!

GUS:
But we don't know when or where.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Oh, yes, we do. Yes, we do. You call Fleet Feat Trucking. Find out if they're making any custom car deliveries today. Find out when and where. (slaps the frog on the desk) I'll go get Jules and Lassie. (runs out) Dude, we got this!

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

CARLTON is lecturing to a sparsely populated room of less than enthusiastic listeners.

LASSITER:
As you will see, the tools in the arsenal of the modern-day detective are formidable, to say the least. Lights, please. Enjoy.

The lights dim and the PowerPoint presentation starts. SHAWN is sitting at one of the tables nervously waiting for GUS. GUS enters and sits beside SHAWN.

GUS:
I pretended to be Jonny G.'s lawyer. Got the trucking company to tell me that a fleet from Bling it On is expected to be dropped off at 2:30. I wrote the location down. (hands SHAWN piece of paper)

SHAWN:
(looks at paper) This says "In the middle of a field". Why did you have to write that down?

GUS:
The address is on the back.

SHAWN:
Nice. (checks watch) We don't...We don't have a lot of time.

LASSITER:
Lights, please.

GUS:
No.

The lights come back on.

LASSITER:
Scientific advancements in the mapping of the human genome, in the manipulation of the building blocks of matter itself, have taken law enforcement into the 21st century and beyond.

JULIET stands and claps. The audience follows.

LASSITER:
Thank you. Thanks very much. (sits on the edge of the table) So, are there any questions?

A YOUNG WOMAN raises her hand.

LASSITER:
Yes.

YOUNG WOMAN:
I thought you were gonna show us some new law enforcement techniques. We've seen all these things on CSI.

LASSITER:
Well, I can assure you that this technology represents the latest available to police departments.

SHAWN looks nervously at his watch as LASSITER talks. To speed things along, he has a "vision".

SHAWN:
Oh, now you're onto something, Lassie!

SHAWN holds his hands in front of him as he stands, pretending to be drawn towards the front of the room.

LASSITER:
(peers) Spencer? Nobody called for a psychic.

YOUNG MAN:
Psychic? Awesome!

The YOUNG WOMAN stands as SHAWN and GUS pass her table.

SHAWN:
I'm getting a reading here. It's strange. (clamps his hands on a pitcher) Gus, what is this?

GUS:
I think you may be magnetized.

GUS tries to pull the pitcher from his hands and they both groan with the effort. LASSITER pinches his nose as SHAWN carries on. He becomes attached to a second pitcher and bashes the two together. He drops them and staggers forward, picking up another pitcher on the way. He reaches the table and LASSITER takes the pitcher.

LASSITER:
Give me. Right in the middle of my presentation.

SHAWN opens the laptop and types on it as if he is being forced.

YOUNG WOMAN:
Wait, is he police sanctioned?

LASSITER:
(realizing this could change the tone of the presentation) Yes. Yes, he is. Because we at the Santa Barbara Police Department believe in using every tool in our arsenal to combat crime, and Mr. Spencer here is often under my jurisdiction.

SHAWN:
(panting) Wait, I'm getting a location. (pulls his search on the main screen) It's an abandoned railroad track, but why? Please tell me, spirits of cutting-edge law enforcement technology. I'm getting Michael Douglas. Catherine Zeta-Jones. The always under-appreciated Don Cheadle.

GUS:
You know that's right.

YOUNG WOMAN:
Traffic.

SHAWN:
(picks up gun)(fake Cuban accent) "Say hello to my little friend!"

YOUNG MAN:
Uh, Scarface.

LASSITER yanks the gun from SHAWN.

YOUNG WOMAN:
They're all movies about drugs!

SHAWN:
Yes! Drugs! There must be a giant drug deal going down there! Right now!

JULIET:
We can send a squad car over to check it out.

LASSITER:
(resignedly) Fine.

SHAWN:
There's no time! It's happening in ten minutes. We have to go now!

LASSITER:
We can't get there in ten minutes.

GUS:
I can. Let's roll. (holds up keys and runs for the door)

SHAWN runs after GUS.

LASSITER:
Fine.

YOUNG WOMAN:
Can we come?

LASSITER:
Yes, of course you can come. You wait out front. And we'll pull around for you.

LASSITER and JULIET run out of the room after GUS and SHAWN.

EXT. ABANDONED RAILROAD YARD, DAY

WALLY'S business partner opens a briefcase to reveal it loaded with straps of bills. WALLY looks at it in admiration. Behind them are cars on trailers.

WALLY:
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.

BUYER:
Thank you.

Police sirens sound and the Echo leads the way into the lot. JULIET and LASSITER get out of the back seat and aim their gun at WALLY and the BUYER.

LASSITER:
Get up against the car. Turn around! (puts WALLY against the car) Up against the car!

LASSITER cuffs WALLY and JULIET cuffs the BUYER.

WALLY:
Look, we were just having a business transaction. I was like, "Here are your automotive parts, good sir," and he's like, "Please, take my money". Capitalism.

LASSITER grabs WALLY by the arms and pushes him towards the patrol cars.

LASSITER:
Come on.

SHAWN:
Oh, Wally. Selling custom car parts is legal. Killing Jonny G. to take over his drug operation... not legal.

WALLY:
I'm laughing. Ha ha ha ha. Entertained.

SHAWN:
Well, we try. Makes perfect sense, though. Knowing how much you resented Jonny G. for not including you in the real business down at the shop, huh? (remembers talking with WALLY in prison) You figured out a way to take him out and take over his entire enterprise. You got yourself arrested because you knew that in jail, you'd have the perfect alibi when Jonny G. showed up dead.

We see WALLY stealing LASSITER'S car.

SHAWN:
Brilliantly planned this murder beforehand, knowing that Jonny G. is a creature of habit. (remembers JONNY G. liked to do final checks himself) That he personally inspects every single car on the day that it's supposed to be delivered, and that he is very, very thorough. So you figured out which canister of nitrous oxide he'd be using, and rigged it so it would leak when the gauge redlined.

We see WALLY fixing the canister.

WALLY:
Very creative. But unlike last time, there's no evidence. The People's burden.

SHAWN:
(nods at WALLY'S words then looks at JULIET) I'm sorry, Jules, what was that?

JULIET:
Oh, I didn't say anything.

SHAWN:
You didn't say anything?

JULIET:
No.

SHAWN:
Well, who's the chatty Cathy with... back there in... nothing? Well, who's... who's talking?(looks to the officers who shake their heads) Some... somebody that saw everything go down. (backs up to the cars, hand to his ear) Wha... who... who is that? (stops in front of a car and pats it) It's Bessie. It's Bessie the Mustang. She's a female Mustang. That doesn't make any sense. Technically, that would make her a... what?

GUS:
That would be a filly.

SHAWN:
A filly, everyone. Bessie is technically a filly, she... (leans in towards the car) I'm sorry, what? Put his what in your what? (spins a spoiler on the hubcap) Check inside Bessie's wheels. Check inside her wheels.

SHAWN steps away and an officer starts to remove the hubcap.

WALLY:
Okay, stop. You don't have a warrant. That's illegal seizure. Bill of Rights.

LASSITER:
Very suspicious behavior.

JULIET:
Probable cause.

SHAWN:
Nice, Jules.

The OFFICER walks over with the hubcap showing bags of drugs fastened to the inside.

OFFICER:
It's drugs.

SHAWN:
Uh-oh.

LASSITER:
You are under arrest. But this time, it's for drug trafficking and murder. (leads WALLY to the car)

SHAWN:
Guess that's three strikes.

GUS:
Legislated!

SHAWN:
Oh, nice, Gus.

SHAWN and GUS fist bump then wiggle their fingers as they make a trilling sound.

INT. SPA, RECEPTION, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the spa.

SHAWN:
Oh! Oh, we deserve this.

GUS:
Oh, tell me about it.

They walk up to the desk.

SHAWN:
Hey, dude.

EMPLOYEE:
Hey.

GUS:
Yeah, we'd like to schedule a couple of massages with Gloria.

EMPLOYEE:
I'm sorry, but Gloria's still booked. The only slot she has available is a couples' session.

SHAWN and GUS answer at the same time.

SHAWN:
That's fine.

GUS:
No.

GUS stares at SHAWN.

SHAWN:
I mean, no way.

GUS:
Thank you.

They walk away from the desk.

GUS:
What's wrong with you?

SHAWN:
Dude, you're the one who said she's so amazing. I figured it was worth it.

They walk towards the exit.

GUS:
Me and you in the same room with just a towel between us? Not gonna happen. She's blind. I'm not. That's naked and ashamed, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Maybe you're ashamed.

GUS:
Naked and ashamed.

SHAWN:
You're ashamed.

GUS:
I'm not ashamed, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Full of shame.

GUS:
I am not!

Episode 2x05 And Down the Stretch Comes Murder

1987

STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are running down the street along with some other boys like they are all being chased. "I Ran" by Flock of Seagulls plays over the sequence.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, DAY

The boys run into the hall screaming. GUS and SHAWN duck around the corner and hide in an alcove behind a row of lockers.

SHAWN:
Do you think he saw us?

GUS shrieks in terror.

JIMMY:
(grabs them by the shoulder) What up, dipwads?

JIMMY is a large boy, the epitome of a bully.

GUS:
Oh, no, Jimmy Nickles!

JIMMY manhandles them to the front of the lockers.

JIMMY:
Gimme the money.

SHAWN:
Actually, we didn't bring it today.

GUS:
(digs into his pocket) Here you go. (gives JIMMY money)

SHAWN:
Gus!

JIMMY:
Give it up, Spencer. Or I'll shove a Jimmy Nickle sandwich right in your grill!

GUS:
I think it's a knuckle sandwich.

JIMMY makes a lunge towards GUS who whimpers and tries to press himself against the lockers. JIMMY then turns to SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Okay, okay. (takes money from pocket and gives it to JIMMY)

JIMMY:
And from the KangaROOS?

SHAWN bends over and takes a bill from the small pocket on the side of his sneakers and gives it to JIMMY.

JIMMY:
See you tomorrow, butt munches. It's sloppy joes and tater tots. (leaves)

SHAWN:
You know, Gus, one of these days, we're gonna stand up to Jimmy Nickles.

GUS:
Yeah, I think I'll stay home sick that day.

The school bell rings.

PRESENT DAY

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS saunters into the office to find SHAWN already there, lounging on a chair, feet on the table.

SHAWN:
It's about time. Sit down, I have troubling news.

GUS:
You forgot to TiVo America's Next Top Model, didn't you? Why is it so hard to set the Season Pass?

SHAWN:
It's not Top Model related.

GUS:
What is it?

SHAWN:
Jimmy Nicholas called.

GUS:
Jimmy Nickles called us? From where? Prison?

SHAWN:
I don't think so. It didn't sound like it. What does prison sound like? Is there singing?

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
I don't know. He left a message.

GUS:
Don't you dare return that call.

SHAWN:
I don't need to. He's coming here in five minutes.

GUS looks around nervously and shuts the door.

GUS:
Jimmy Nickles coming here? In five minutes?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

GUS:
We can handle this. We can handle this. I'm gonna go print out a fake foreclosure notice and stick it on the front door. And then we both can go outside and scrape the "psych" sign off the front window.

SHAWN:
Gus, I think we can afford to relax a little bit. He said he wants to talk, and by "talk" I hope he means talk, not my head in a toilet.

GUS goes to his desk and opens his laptop.

GUS:
He's gonna try and kill us.

SHAWN:
He's not gonna kill us. Right? I mean, people change. We haven't seen him since the fifth grade.

GUS:
I don't need to see him, Shawn. Some people are just born evil. The kid from The Omen, the Children of the Corn, Chad Michael Murray. (turns and sees a row of lockers) What is this?

SHAWN:
(stands and goes to lockers) Ooh, ebay! Auto bid! 600 bucks plus a penny. The penny's a trick. I got in a full-on bidding war with a Montessori school.

GUS:
What do we need a locker in the office for?

SHAWN:
First of all, I have nowhere to put my sociology text book. And... (opens first two lockers) Chicka-Chickahh!

Inside the door of each locker are taped publicity shots of Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas from "Miami Vice". SHAWN strikes the same pose as Don Johnson.

GUS:
You always gotta hit it right on the nose, don't you? Why couldn't I be Crockett? (walks back to desk)

SHAWN:
Because, Gus. You stood in front of the entire third grade class and said, "When I grow up, I wanna be Philip Michael Thomas."

GUS:
Well, you said you wanted to be the mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers.

SHAWN:
Dude, he's the biggest sausage in the world.

GUS:
Why is Jimmy Nickles coming here, Shawn? How big is he now?

SHAWN:
I don't know!

GUS:
Why couldn't you be a real psychic?

There's a knock on the door. They look over in panic.

JIMMY:
(muffled) Hey, you guys in there?

SHAWN:
Oh, God, that's him.

GUS:
(reaches into locker and pulls out a small bat) He's not getting my lunch money, I'll tell you that much.

SHAWN:
Great, you can terrify him with your Wally Joyner mini-bat.

GUS:
Open the door.

SHAWN goes to the door. GUS follows, holding the bat like a weapon. SHAWN opens the door and looks out just seeing the top of someone's head. He looks down and there's JIMMY, all 5'2" of him.

JIMMY:
What up, boys?

SHAWN:
(looks at GUS and whispers) That's a good call with the mini-bat.

Embarrassed, GUS hides the bat behind his back.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

JIMMY stands in the doorway, hands on hips.

JIMMY:
You D-bags gonna let me in or what?

SHAWN:
D- bags? Yeah, come on in, Jim.

JIMMY enters the room and fakes a lunge at GUS with a grunt. GUS flinches. JIMMY laughs.

SHAWN:
Way not to be scared, flincher.

GUS:
I didn't flinch. You know I have a caffeine tic.

JIMMY:
Look at this place. Video games, lockers. You two haven't grown up at all, huh?

SHAWN:
And you haven't grown up. Up. At all.

GUS:
Jimmy, as glad as we are to see you, what are you doing here?

JIMMY:
What do you think I'm doing here, barf beetle? I came to take your lunch money. Hand it over!

GUS looks nervously at SHAWN. JIMMY laughs at them. As he turns around, GUS lunges at him with the bat, but SHAWN pulls him back by the arm.

JIMMY:
I'm just messing around. Actually, I'm in town for, uh, work.

SHAWN:
(sees hair on JIMMY'S shirt and mud on his shoes) I'm sensing... You became a jockey.

JIMMY:
(affronted) A jockey? Yeah, one of the best jockeys. Yeah, I won most of my races. Till this stupid Santa Barbara meet started. Now I'm on some ridiculous losing streak. The last three favorites I've ridden have all lost. And I know it wasn't something I did. I started to lose all my best mounts.

GUS:
Mounts?

JIMMY:
Horses, Guster. What's wrong with you?

JIMMY turns his back and GUS goes for him with the bat yet again. SHAWN holds him back.

SHAWN:
Look, uh, Jimmy, what is it exactly you'd like for us to do?

JIMMY:
Well, uh, one of our friends from our old school told me about your company. Even though it sounds kinda gay, I thought I could hire you to come down to the track and maybe, uh, psychically figure out what's wrong with the horses.

GUS:
(brings the bat out from behind his back and uses it to emphasize his argument) Okay, first of all, you ride on the back of mounts while carrying a whip. That's much gayer than what we do.

JIMMY turns his head and GUS looks in the same direction, seeing the "Miami Vice" pictures.

GUS:
Either way, we're busy right now. So I don't think we'll be able to...

SHAWN:
We'll take the case.

GUS glares at SHAWN.

JIMMY:
I thought so. All right, meet me at the track at 2:00. And as far as anyone else knows, you guys are just some really good old friends. Got it, dill holes?

SHAWN:
(chuckles) Got it. You can count on us dill holes. Good-bye, Jim. (closes the door behind JIMMY)

GUS:
Are you crazy?

SHAWN:
I wouldn't say crazy. Maybe an eccentric who looks good in jeans. Come on, Gus, you're not actually still afraid of Jimmy Nickles, are you? (sits at desk)

GUS:
We're not helping that little monster, Shawn. Period.

SHAWN:
Okay, so Jimmy's still a jerk. We can see that. But the truth is... I feel like I owe him.

GUS:
For what?! If anything, he owes us for 170 lunches. You know, I added that up once, and with inflation, that's, like, $1,800.

SHAWN:
Look, do you remember when Jimmy got kicked out of school in the fifth grade?

GUS:
For killing a teacher?

SHAWN:
For hitting Miss Lepky with a spitball. She fell and got hurt.

GUS:
Same difference. She could've very well have been killed.

SHAWN:
It was me who ratted him out, Gus.

GUS:
(shocked) You did that? Why didn't you ever tell me?

SHAWN:
You don't know all my secrets. I'm a man of untold mysteries. If he found out, he'd come back and gnaw off one of my toes.

GUS:
Ratting out Jimmy Nickles? That's suicidal.

SHAWN:
I thought I saw him do it, and I told Principal Tropp, because he said he wasn't gonna let the class go until somebody gave him a name.

GUS:
And what? You just had to get home?

SHAWN:
Dude, CHiP's was gonna come on in, like, 20 minutes. What was I supposed to do? It was the one with the freeway crash. Where the car used the empty car carrier trailer as a ramp and flipped in mid-air.

GUS:
That happens in every episode, Shawn.

SHAWN:
I was under a lot of pressure.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. CLASSROOM, DAY

The children are sitting at their desks, head down, as TROPP walks up and down the rows. As he passes, SHAWN slips him a note. TROPP walks to the front of the classroom and opens the note. It reads: "Jimmy Nickles did it! Your hair looks great". TROPP smiles, walks over to JIMMY at his desk and bends over.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS is now doing repetitions with a barbell.

GUS:
A) I always knew you were a kiss-ass. B) Who cares? So Jimmy got kicked out. It was the best day of my life. I could finally wear underwear to school again.

SHAWN:
(leans against GUS' desk holding squeaky frog) I don't know, Gus. I always sort of felt like I got the wrong guy. I'll never forget the look on Jimmy's face when they hauled him out of class that day.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. CLASSROOM, DAY

The children still have their heads down as JIMMY is taken out of class. SHAWN and a few others tilt their heads and watch.

JIMMY:
I didn't do it! I promise, I didn't do it!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS step out of the office and walk towards the Echo.

SHAWN:
Look, after Jimmy got kicked out of school, there were all these stories about what happened to him. He ran away from home, he got thrown in juvenile hall, moved to a small town in Kansas where they outlawed singing and dancing.

GUS:
That last one is Footloose.

SHAWN:
That's a coincidence. The point is, Jimmy's life changed that day, and I feel like I gotta make it up to him. Who knows, Gus, I might've stunted the kid's growth.

GUS:
I don't know, Shawn. We're talking about the same dude who made Aaron Rencher eat his own retainer.

SHAWN:
All right, how about this...We take the case, right? We prove, for all the Aaron Renchers of the world, we are no longer afraid of Jimmy Nickles.

GUS:
All right, fine. But if we take this case, we're gonna overcharge him by $1,800.

SHAWN:
Done.

They get in the car.

EXT. RACE TRACK, PADDOCK, DAY

SHAWN is resting his hand on the forehead of a horse, Runaway ?, eyes closed. He neighs. GUS and JIMMY watch.

SHAWN:
He doesn't like the oats. Or the alfalfa pellets. They're too chewy for pellets. Pellets should be crunchy. They should have a natural crunch to them. (neighs) Also, the donkey in stable 11 is a pathological liar.

JIMMY:
This is idiotic.

SHAWN:
Look, it takes a while for the connection to take hold, Jimmy. Runny D. And I are just feeling each other out here. (strokes horse's mane)

JIMMY:
Whatever. I gotta go lose five pounds before the next race. You got half an hour to figure out what's going on.

JIMMY enters the locker room and GUS walks over to SHAWN.

SHAWN:
What do you think, Runny D.?

GUS:
I'll tell you what he's thinking. He's thinking, "I hate Jimmy. He pulled my shorts down in front of Jenny Scarlatos in the cafeteria."

SHAWN:
Are you channeling the horse? Or a little boy with a tight fade who used to wear his OPs without a drawstring?

GUS:
The horse, Shawn. I didn't have a tight fade in the third grade.

They hear a wolf whistle and turn to see a tall blonde woman in a short red halter dress being followed by a jockey. She turns at the whistle and smiles.

WOMAN:
Hey!

JOCKEY:
What's up?

WOMAN:
(takes JOCKEY'S hand) How are you?

SHAWN sees a wedding band on her finger. She looks around nervously, realizing they're in public, and walks away.

SHAWN:
That's interesting.

GUS turns to see what SHAWN is looking at and they both watch as the woman gets into a BMW convertible.

EXT. RACE TRACK, TRACK, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk towards the track rail.

SHAWN:
This place is weird and borderline depressing. I mean, who are these people? Who actually comes here?

HENRY:
Well, well, well. This I never thought I'd see.

HENRY is wearing a loud and garish Hawaiian-style shirt.

SHAWN:
Wow, Dad. Tell me you're wearing that shirt because someone has to spot you from space.

HENRY:
Very funny, Shawn. This happens to be one of my lucky track shirts.

GUS:
I like it.

SHAWN:
I'd like it too, if I had to walk home in the dark.

A MAN near HENRY'S age came over. He was wearing an open button-down shirt over a T-shirt. He also had a thick gold chain necklace. His hair was receding in front but longer in the back.

MAN:
Henry. This your kid? Hey, kid. Phil "The Thrill" Shershow. (shakes SHAWN'S hand)

SHAWN:
Shawn. This is Burton "Oil Can" Guster.

PHIL:
(shakes GUS' hand) Good to meetcha. Hey, Henry tell ya for 20 years, I been handicapping horses?

SHAWN:
That seems so very cruel.

PHIL:
He musta told ya I hit the pick six in '87?

HENRY:
Hey Phil, I think it's pretty safe to assume, I haven't told 'em anything.

PHIL:
(checks watch) Five minutes to post. Gotta make it back. (leans forward like imparting a secret) Let me tell ya, I like the 2-3-4 trifecta box. (leaves)

SHAWN:
I think your shirt and his shirt should get together and go bowling.

HENRY:
(sarcastic) Ha-ha.

SHAWN:
You have all kinds of interesting pals I don't know about.

HENRY:
All right, Shawn, look, don't start. Phil is not a pal. He's a bad gambler who doesn't know when to quit. But he also happens to be on a hot streak right now, which is why I let him talk to me. Not that I need it. I have won 8 of 11 races today all by myself.

SHAWN whistles in appreciation.

HENRY:
All right, Shawn what are you doing out here anyway? I tried to drag you out here for years.

SHAWN:
I'm only here today 'cause we're working on a case.

HENRY:
You know, I think the reason you never came out here is because to be a good handicapper, you gotta put in the time, you gotta do the research, you gotta study the horses, you gotta study the jockeys. Something that takes patience and follow-through, which you lack.

SHAWN:
Yes, that and a shirt from Mr. Furley's closet.

>>>LATER>>>

The bell rings and the gates open, releasing the horses.

ANNOUNCER:
(over speaker) And the race is on. Baby-faced Assassin takes the early lead. Baby-faced Assassin strides into the first...

SHAWN and GUS watch the race as they lean against the rail next to HENRY.

HENRY:
So what's the case?

SHAWN:
Have you ever heard of a Jimmy Nickles?

HENRY:
You mean Jimmy Nicholas. Yeah, solid jockey, bad bet. He's been losing lately.

GUS:
That's why he hired us. He thinks that maybe something's psychically wrong with the horses.

HENRY:
Yeah, the horses are losing, that's what's wrong with them.

GUS:
Yeah, we didn't find anything.

HENRY:
Of course you didn't. There's a million reasons a horse loses, and none of 'em have to do with crystals and moonbeams.

ANNOUNCER:
(over speaker) Youthful Spirit is gaining. And it's Youthful Spirit! Youthful Spirit! Youthful Spirit pulls it out.

SHAWN:
What I do is much more than that. It's... It's intuition.

HENRY:
Son, you got no case. (pats SHAWN on the back a he heads inside)

SHAWN:
Oh, well, thanks. We'll just go home then.

One of the jockeys falls from his horse. It is the same one who had talked with the blonde earlier.

WOMAN:
Juan Carlos!

MAN 1:
Help him!

Two men rush over to the fallen man, one of them, a photographer, starts CPR.

ANNOUNCER:
(over speaker) Medical assistance to the track. We need medical assistance to the track immediately.

MAN 2:
Jockey down!

MAN 3:
Juan Carlos! Carlos!

SHAWN, GUS and HENRY join the crowd watching from a distance.

SHAWN:
So, a jockey who was alive at the beginning of the race is dead by the end. Not to sound insensitive, but I say we do have a case.

GUS:
That sounds insensitive.

SHAWN:
Yeah, I know.

The EMTs arrive and take over.

EXT. RACE TRACK, PADDOCK, DAY

JULIET is with SHAWN and GUS as the EMTs wheel the gurney bearing the jockey's body past. PHIL is leaning against a doorway in the background.

JULIET:
And you guys just happened to be at the track?

SHAWN:
Jules, it's free churro day.

GUS:
Do they have a cause of death yet?

JULIET:
Probable heart attack.

LASSITER is interviewing the photographer. SHAWN watches as he reaches into a pocket and holds out a carrot behind his back as one of the horses walks by. SHAWN smiles. LASSITER tries to cover it by directing JULIET.

LASSITER:
Uh, O'Hara, I need you to interview the rest of those jockeys.

JULIET groans.

SHAWN:
What is that?

JULIET:
Sorry. It's just little people make me... Well, let's just say I had a bad experience with a Christmas elf.

GUS:
What, he didn't give you the right present?

JULIET:
No. We dated. And then he dumped me for a dancer from The Ice Storm on ice. (leaves)

SHAWN:
She is an enigma wrapped in a little, blonde riddle.

GUS:
Shawn, I don't think Juan Carlos died of a heart attack. I only got to see him for a second, but I'm pretty sure he had blood shot eyes. And his body was totally stiff. That's a reaction to a tranquilizer or even a poison. Something affected his nervous system.

SHAWN:
Thank you, Dr. Pratt. See if we can get another look at that body.

GUS:
You bet.

LASSITER:
Hey, you two, don't go anywhere. I wanna talk to you when I'm done.

SHAWN:
Gus has a cramp. (pause) I have a cramp? (pause) We have to pee.

LASSITER:
Fine, just be back in five minutes.

SHAWN and GUS hurry over to the gurney holding the body.

GUS:
"We gotta pee?" that's the best you can come up with?

SHAWN:
Just hurry up.

GUS unzips the bag but there's nothing there.

SHAWN:
Really?

GUS opens the bag further and there's still no sign of a body.

SHAWN:
How short was this guy? Give it one more.

GUS opens the bag even more and they finally see something.

SHAWN:
We have boots.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

JULIET and LASSITER are sitting at the table.

JULIET:
We've confirmed that a heart attack was the cause of Juan Carlos Espinoza's death.

JULIET hands the file to LASSITER who then passes it to VICK. SHAWN and GUS enter the room.

SHAWN:
Wait. Everyone stop. Let's acknowledge that the Chief is wearing leopard print. (pause) And continue. (puts hands to head) I'm getting something. A rose with, with, with...a thorn. No. A rocket. Rikki Rocket. C.C. Deville.

GUS:
David Lee Roth?

SHAWN:
(points at GUS) Wrong band.

JULIET:
Poison!

SHAWN:
(smiles at JULIET, impressed) Yes. Poison. Juan Carlos was poisoned.

LASSITER:
He's right.

SHAWN:
Chief, I am so sick of Lassiter treating us like second-class citizens. (realizes what LASSITER said) What?

LASSITER:
You're right. Espinoza had a cocktail of drugs in his system. Opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, three different kinds of weight loss drugs, Cyalis, and horse tranquilizers.

GUS:
Horse tranquilizers?

LASSITER:
Apparently, the guy took everything in sight. He was 4'9" and 3 feet of that were drugs.

VICK:
And obviously, his heart couldn't handle it. A very thorough job, detectives.

SHAWN:
I'm getting something else. (remembers what he saw earlier) Juan Carlos was having an affair. With a married woman.

JULIET:
Shawn, how do you know this?

SHAWN:
Same way I know that as a child, Lassie wanted nothing more than a pony.

LASSITER:
Well, come on, who didn't?

GUS:
Anyone who wasn't an eight-year-old girl.

SHAWN:
(exclaims) Uh-oh. (falls into a squat beside the table) I see a tall, blonde woman.

GUS:
Brigitte Nielson?

SHAWN:
No! She has 23 diamonds in her wedding ring. And she bandies about the track, this way and that. (stands) Shouldn't we at least find this woman and talk to her?

VICK:
(looks at LASSITER and JULIET) Do you know anything about this, detectives?

JULIET and LASSITER avoid her gaze.

VICK:
Oh, well, maybe you should find out before we put this case to bed.

VICK stands and hands the file back to LASSITER before heading towards the door. LASSITER passes the file to JULIET and they both stand to leave the office. SHAWN stands in front of LASSITER.

SHAWN:
Lassie, your childhood must've been pure hell. The good news, I'm available for hugs. (holds arms out but LASSITER leaves)  Jules. How about it? (JULIET leaves) Buddy. It's been a while.

GUS:
Please. (leaves)

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN jogs into the office wearing shorts and a sweatshirt, listening to his iPod. He goes over to the lockers. GUS is sitting at his desk, working on his laptop.

GUS:
You're here early.

SHAWN:
Yeah, couldn't sleep, you know? Came in early, did a little work on the case. Went for a run. Oh, and I did this. (stands at the end of the lockers and hits the side, opening the closest locker)

GUS:
Nice. I did some work as well. Turns out the horse tranquilizer Juan Carlos had in his body was ketamine, which doesn't make any sense, 'cause ketamine causes a state of anesthesia.

SHAWN:
(takes off sweatshirt) Well, that's good, Gus, but I was talking about the spitball incident.

GUS:
The spitball incident? (scoffs) Shawn, you need to leave that alone. If you haven't figured it out by now, you never will.

SHAWN:
I can't leave it alone. I won't. I've gone over it in my head a thousand times. Just hear me out.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. CLASSROOM, DAY

Miss LEPKY climbs on the stepladder like before. SHAWN is sitting in the desk behind his younger self. YOUNG SHAWN turns around.

YOUNG SHAWN:
What are you doing here?

SHAWN:
This is my head, dude. I can do whatever I want. What did we miss? What's going on here?

YOUNG SHAWN:
Is that what my hair looks like in the future?

SHAWN:
It sure is.

YOUNG SHAWN:
But I thought I'd be bald by 20. This changes everything.

SHAWN:
Yeah, it does. Think big.

MISS LEPKY falls and both turn to look at JIMMY. JIMMY is laughing, a straw at his mouth.

YOUNG SHAWN:
It was Jimmy!

SHAWN sees a juice box in JIMMY'S hand and that there is juice in the straw.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's sipping through the straw, not spitting it out. It couldn't have been him. There was a...

BOTH:
...second spitter.

YOUNG SHAWN:
That's so cool.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. RACE TRACK, GRANDSTAND, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk through the grandstand.

GUS:
Let it go, Shawn. Your second spitter theory is crazy.

SHAWN:
Oh yeah, what about your teen wolf theory?

GUS:
Hey, that's just a fact. If any of us were in high school and some dude became a wolf, we wouldn't be cool with him just because he could dunk a basketball. I certainly wouldn't be selling "I heart wolf" T-shirts, I can tell you that.

SHAWN:
Oh, save it for your podcast.

GUS:
Hey, you brought it up.

SHAWN:
I'm gonna go talk to Jimmy Nickles. You look for T.B.W.

GUS:
T.B.W.?

SHAWN:
Tall Blonde Woman. I abbreviated, Gus. All the kids are doing it these days. Just hope we don't run into my...

GUS:
Y.D.?

SHAWN:
Y.D.?

GUS:
Your dad. And it's too late.

HENRY walks up to a counter wearing another loud shirt.

SHAWN:
Oh, my God, the shirt has a brother.

HENRY:
Ha, very funny, Shawn. If you're looking for your boy Jimmy, they just announced he was taken off all the races for the day.

SHAWN:
Seriously? I wonder why.

GUS:
Isn't that Barry Saunder? The announcer guy. He's like a local legend.

An older man in a navy blazer and white hat is signing autographs.

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. "The Voice," right?

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Hey, dad, do you know him? Can you introduce us or what?

HENRY:
(stammers) I met him once at a policeman's ball, but it was years ago.

SHAWN:
Hey, uh, Mr. Saunder!

SAUNDER looks up.

SHAWN:
Hi. Look who's here. Your old pal, Hank Spencer.

SAUNDER:
(walks over) Do I know you?

GUS:
No, but we know you. What is it you always say? "And the race is on."

SHAWN:
(emphatic) "And the race is on!"

GUS:
"And the race is... on!" Hey, can you do it for us one time?

SAUNDER:
(bored) And the race is on.

SHAWN:
(kisses his fingers like a chef) That's it, right there.

SAUNDER:
(reaches into pocket and pulls out buttons) Won't you boys have a button?

HENRY:
I'm sorry, Mr. Saunder. I'm Henry Spencer. This is my son Shawn and his friend Gus. They finally just started coming to the races.

SAUNDER:
Oh, too bad. The track's probably closing down after this meet. 25 years I've been doing this.

GUS:
Why is it closing down?

SAUNDER:
Well, no one comes anymore.

SHAWN:
Is it because of his shirt? (points at HENRY) I'm sorry, Dad, this is, like, a genocide of color Somewhere, a rainbow's weeping. Mr. Saunder, do you know why Jimmy Nickles was pulled off all of his races today? We're his buddies. We came down to see him.

SAUNDER:
No, uh... It's a shame, really. Jimmy was just getting back to a full schedule. Juan Carlos had taken most of his good mounts before he died.

SHAWN:
Really? We didn't know that.

SAUNDER:
Oh, they quarreled about it all the time.

SHAWN:
Did they?

GUS:
Shawn, look. T.B.W.

The blonde hurries out the doors towards the stands.

SHAWN:
Way to stay on the abbreviation train, Gus.

GUS:
You mean the A.T.?

SAUNDER:
You're talking about Janine? That's Jimmy's wife.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. T.B.W. is Jimmy's wife?

SAUNDER:
Yes.

GUS:
Looks like Juan Carlos was taking all of Jimmy's mounts.

SAUNDER walks away.

EXT. RACE TRACK, PADDOCK, DAY

JANINE runs down to the stable area where LASSITER and JULIET are taking a handcuffed JIMMY into custody.

JIMMY:
I didn't kill Juan Carlos! I didn't do it, I swear!

SHAWN and GUS watch from the top of the stairs.

JIMMY:
Come on!

JANINE:
Jimmy!

JIMMY:
You gotta believe me!

LASSITER:
(to JANINE) Back off.

JANINE:
Let me talk to him, please!

JULIET helps the officer restrain JANINE as LASSITER puts JIMMY in the back seat of his car.

JIMMY:
Come on, I didn't do it!

GUS:
Okay, so let me get this straight. You took on this case because you felt bad about Jimmy getting kicked out of school for something he didn't do. And now you just convinced the police to reopen the case that led to Jimmy being arrested for murder.

SHAWN:
Did I ask for nutshelling?

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS watch through the window as JIMMY paces the interrogation room. An officer is with him.

SHAWN:
I think he looks like a tangelo in that outfit. Or maybe a clementine with seeds full of hate.

GUS:
I think he looks like an evil little Creamsicle.

SHAWN:
(laughs) You mean Dreamsicle.

GUS:
No, Shawn, Creamsicle. They're exclusively orange.

JULIET stands in the doorway.

JULIET:
Okay, Lassiter says you can have five minutes with Jimmy.

SHAWN:
Sweet.

JULIET:
And good job, by the way. We never would've reopened the case and arrested him if it wasn't for you.

SHAWN puts a hand on GUS' arm.

GUS:
You didn't tell Jimmy that, did you?

JULIET:
No.

SHAWN and GUS sigh in relief.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

GUS and SHAWN are sitting opposite JIMMY at the table.

JIMMY:
I didn't kill Juan Carlos.

SHAWN:
We know.

JIMMY:
Someone must've tipped 'em off. But I swear I didn't do it.

GUS:
Say Jimmy, isn't that exactly like you and that spitball incident?

SHAWN kicks GUS under the table. GUS kicks him back. They go on for a bit before JIMMY stops them.

JIMMY:
Guys!

SHAWN:
Look... I think what Gus is trying to say is we'd really like to help. We would, but the evidence.

JIMMY:
What?

SHAWN:
Juan Carlos took all your mounts.

JIMMY:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
You fought with him over it.

JIMMY:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
They found ketamine in your locker.

JIMMY:
That wasn't mine.

GUS:
And your wife was having an affair with Juan Carlos.

JIMMY:
What?!

JIMMY lunges across the table at GUS. The officer picks him up bodily.

JIMMY:
All right, Purvis, put me down. (officer puts him down and)(points) Don't push me.

SHAWN:
(whispers to GUS) I'm getting the feeling he didn't know about the affair.

GUS:
(whispers to SHAWN) You think?

JIMMY:
I'm sorry, I just...I can't believe she would do that. Especially after I told her I wouldn't sleep with any more Russian models.

GUS:
(mouths) Models?

JIMMY sits down.

SHAWN:
I think we may have gotten off point, Jimmy. Let's go back to the beginning. Obviously, the races you lost are somehow connected to Juan Carlos's murder. So is there anything else you can tell us or that you remember about those races?

JIMMY:
No. The horses were all running great. But right around the... clubhouse turn, they all faded down the stretch.

SHAWN:
All of them faded down the stretch?

JIMMY:
You know what? Yeah.

SHAWN:
Good. That's a good place to begin.

EXT. RACE TRACK, TRACK, DAY

GUS watches as SHAWN leans over the inner rail as if listening.

GUS:
All right, that's enough, Shawn, let's go. You've been standing at that thing for an hour.

SHAWN:
(straightens up) Let me take off my shoes and try it lying down.

GUS:
No, Shawn. You don't have anything. It's a dead end. Face it. We have to tell Jimmy he's screwed.

SHAWN:
Fine. You tell Jimmy.

GUS:
Me? I never wanted to take this case in the first place.

SHAWN:
(looks down the track then back at GUS) I'll race you for it.

GUS:
What?! No.

SHAWN:
That's right. And I know why.

GUS:
Why?

SHAWN:
'Cause I beat you in the 100-yard dash in the Junior High Olympics. (leans against the rail)

GUS:
Please! First of all, you know I had shin splints, a torn meniscus, and a planter's wart.

SHAWN:
Gus, you copied those terms from the glossary of our health textbook. You have no idea what they mean!

GUS:
Ask my doctor. I had a ruptured patella too, but I wasn't gonna say anything. (stretches legs) Besides... Go! (runs off)

SHAWN:
Oh, no! No, you didn't! (races after GUS)

They run, rather inelegantly, down the track. In a photo finish, SHAWN wins by a nose. He practically collapses, grabbing the rail. GUS bends over, trying to catch his breath.

SHAWN:
(breathing heavily) You almost had me.

GUS:
(breathing heavily) What? I had you by at least a foot.

SHAWN:
(breathing heavily) I'm gonna give this to you.

GUS:
(breathing heavily) I thought so.

SHAWN:
(breathing heavily) Not because you won. 'Cause you need a victory in your life more than I do right now.

GUS:
(breathing heavily) What? Oh, no. We're going again.

SHAWN:
(sees binoculars in the announcer's box) I got a better idea.

EXT. RACE TRACK, STAIRS, DAY

SHAWN and GUS jog up the stairs.

GUS:
Seven flights of stairs just to get another view of the track?

SHAWN:
Gus, this is the perfect spot for us to see... (opens door)

INT. RACE TRACK, ANNOUNCER'S BOX, DAY

SAUNDER is at his desk recording announcements.

SAUNDER:
You'll find... (sees SHAWN and GUS)

SHAWN:
See where the magic happens. I told you he'd be here. (crosses to the desk)

SAUNDER:
Can I help you fellas?

GUS:
Uh, yeah, uh... "And the race is on." (laughs nervously)

SAUNDER:
I really don't think you should be up here right now. I'm trying to finish my taped announcements for the day, so...

SHAWN:
Ooh, can I do one? I've always wanted to be an announcer. (into mic) For the owner of a red IROC-Z in lot three. Kindly return your comb to the back pocket of your acid-wash Z. Cavariccis and turn off your headlights. (to SAUNDER) What do you think of that, huh?

SAUNDER:
Have a button.

GUS:
(sees a staff on display) Hey. I've seen one of these before.

SAUNDER:
Yes, it's a shaman's staff.

GUS:
Yeah, I saw a special on the History Channel about the... the Choctaw Indians.

SHAWN:
Ah yes, the Cha-ka Indians. Long-standing rivals of the Sleestak Cowboys.

SAUNDER:
It's pronounced Cho-Ko.

SHAWN:
Gave us the chocodile, amongst other things.

SAUNDER:
I don't think so. I've been collecting these artifacts for a number of years. I'm actually 1/16 Indian myself. But not Cherokee.

SHAWN:
Hey, Gus is 1/16 robot. And not the evil, take-over-the-world from I, Robot kind.

Behind GUS, the PHOTOGRAPHER who tried to save Juan Carlos enters.

PHOTOGRAPHER:
Oh, sorry.

GUS:
Hey, you're the guy that tried to save Juan Carlos.

PHOTOGRAPHER:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
You're the only one who tried to help. Way to go. You should feel proud.

PHOTOGRAPHER:
Uh, he died.

SHAWN:
Yes, he did do that. (sees dated video tapes)

SAUNDER:
Well, gentlemen, (clears throat) Ryan and I have to go over some publicity photos. So if you'd be kind enough...

SHAWN:
(holds button to mouth) "And the race is on!"

SHAWN and GUS leave.

EXT. RACE TRACK, CONCOURSE, DAY

GUS and SHAWN walk the area behind the seats.

GUS:
Chaka? Really? Yeah, I'd be embarrassed if I were you.

SHAWN:
I'm not embarrassed at all, Gus. A Land of the Lost reference is virtually unheard of in everyday conversation.

GUS:
Can we go and see Jimmy now?

SHAWN:
Not yet. Barry has tapes of the races in there. Which means there's a copy of the one Juan Carlos died in. (head down the steps) I don't know why I didn't think of this before. We need to see that tape.

GUS:
There's no way Barry's gonna let us back in there. Don't the police have a copy of it?

SHAWN:
They do, but Lassiter's convinced the case is closed, so he won't help. Which means I'm gonna have to do something I know I will regret.

GUS:
What? Ride your dirt bike off of David King's roof again?

SHAWN:
No. Ask my dad for a favor.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN paces as HENRY watches him from the couch.

SHAWN:
So I was hoping that in your very meticulous, detailed mode, it occurred to you to... (tries to finish) I can't do it.

GUS:
He wants to know if you tape all the horse races.

HENRY:
Of course I do.

SHAWN:
Awesome. Can we watch the one when Juan Carlos died?

HENRY:
You may. On one condition.

>>>LATER>>>

HENRY puts the tape in the VCR. He picks up the remote and sits on the couch.

HENRY:
Deal is you go with me to the derby on Sunday in that shirt.

SHAWN is wearing one of HENRY'S shirts in varying shades of green decorated with pineapples. SHAWN looks like he wants the Earth to open up and swallow him.

SHAWN:
What did I say about regret, Gus? What did I say?

GUS:
I think you pull it off.

HENRY:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
(makes a face) Fine.

HENRY:
(starts tape) All right, here's the race. Juan Carlos is on the number eight horse. I remember this, 'cause Phil convinced me to go with the long shot. The one time I go with the guy, and the horse loses.

SHAWN:
(frustrated) I don't get it. What are we missing? What... What aren't we seeing?

GUS:
Maybe nothing. Maybe Jimmy did poison Juan Carlos.

SHAWN:
I know he didn't poison Juan Carlos, just like I know there's a second spitter.

HENRY:
Shawn, once again, you're focusing too much attention on one aspect of the case. Close your eyes.

SHAWN:
No, I'm not jumping through any more of your hoops today.

HENRY:
You need to broaden your vision, Shawn. You need to look at the outskirts of the case.

SHAWN:
What does that even mean? "Broaden my vision? Look at the outskirts of a..." You know what? I'm out of here. (walks towards door) No. No, no. Not today. You sound like Oprah. I don't even know why I bother coming here. It's a complete waste of time! (leaves)

GUS looks over at HENRY, who puts his hands up in the air.

SHAWN:
(opens door and sticks his head in) A little girl outside just started crying when she saw this shirt. (leaves)

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN has created a model of the classroom using pipe cleaners to create the people. There is also a chalkboard and flag in the corner.

SHAWN:
Oh, good, good, you're here.

GUS:
You texted me seven times. Said it was an emergency.

SHAWN:
Yes, a color emergency. But I think I figured it out. The walls were sandbar white to suppress all creative thought and hide the asbestos.

GUS:
(walks around to look at the model)The walls of what?

SHAWN:
Miss Lepky's classroom.

GUS:
(sits) Why is my name on the detention list?

SHAWN:
You got caught eating a Kit Kat... out of the trash can. The point is, when I left my dad's...

GUS:
You mean stormed out like a little girl?

SHAWN:
I did not. (GUS makes a face) I did. I'll give you that. I realized my dad was actually right. I need to broaden my vision. (extends pointer) And that's when I remembered. We all switched seats in class that week.

GUS:
Right. I had to sit behind Janie Doran and her creepy neck hair.

SHAWN:
And Jimmy (picks up the pipe cleaner with the pointer) moved over two rows, meaning that the second spitter was on the other side. (moves it to another seat but it won't come off the pointer) Gus, get him.

GUS:
Shawn, what does this have to do with horse racing?

SHAWN:
I haven't gotten that far yet.

GUS:
Let me know when you figure it out. (stands and walks out)

SHAWN:
(shakes pointer) Let go, Jimmy. (realizes something)

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS is walking for the car when his phone rings.

GUS:
(answers phone) Hello?

SHAWN:
(over phone) Dude, I figured it out.

GUS turns around to see SHAWN standing in the doorway.

GUS:
Was that really necessary?

SHAWN:
No, but it was dope. (closes his phone and goes inside)

GUS follows SHAWN inside.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN has the race tape playing on the TV.

SAUNDER:
(on tape) Babyfaced Assassin strides into the first turn at the head with none other right on its tail. Babyfaced Assassin...

SHAWN:
Wait for it.

SAUNDER:
(on tape) ...with None Other trade the top spot as they race around the second turn.

SHAWN'S vision zooms in and we see Juan Carlos bat something off his neck.

SHAWN:
Right there! The clubhouse turn. Juan Carlos gets hit by something. This was just like the spitball incident with Jimmy. I was so focused on the stretch that I never looked anywhere else. You know, I didn't broaden my vision, Dad.

HENRY:
Shawn, I love nothing more than to tell you I'm right, but I have no idea what I'm right about.

SHAWN:
The question is why would somebody kill someone like that? (sees the horses' numbers and processes) Guys! Juan Carlos's death was an accident... Yeah! Whatever hit him was meant for a horse. This isn't about murder. It's about fixing races.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS head down the stairs.

SHAWN:
Are the tapes ready?

GUS:
Check. Fake psychic ability?

SHAWN:
Full of it.

GUS:
Yes, you are.

INT. SBPD, A/V ROOM, DAY

GUS peeks in before turning back to SHAWN. GUS guides him in as SHAWN pretends to be blind. JULIET and LASSITER are sitting and VICK approaches them.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, what is going on? First you help us get... Oh. Get Jimmy Nicholas. Now you claim he's innocent?

SHAWN reaches around with his hand and GUS slaps it out of his face. SHAWN slams himself against the wall.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, chief. Psychic solar flares have temporarily blinded me. My sense of smell is compensating for my lack of sight. (bends over and sniffs JULIET) Lilacs in a meadow. (sniffs LASSITER) Is that Camay?

LASSITER:
Oh, this is ridiculous. We've got big boy police work to do.

SHAWN feels his way to the front of the room where there is a large bank of TVs.

SHAWN:
Wait... My eyes are starting to adjust. Where are we?

GUS:
(loudly) We're in the video room!

SHAWN:
I'm blind, Gus. Not deaf.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, we don't have time for this. If you wanted to...

SHAWN:
(casually knocks tapes off the counter) Those tapes. What are on those tapes?

JULIET:
They're the tapes from the track. We reviewed them, but we didn't find anything.

SHAWN:
(holds a tape to his forehead) 6-20. (passes tape to GUS and repeats the process) 6-28. (next tape) 7-2. (next tape) Doritos. (taps head) Big Gulp? (again) Slurpee.

GUS:
7-11? (reads the label on the tape) These are all the dates on the tapes.

SHAWN:
Gus. Let's play these tapes.

SHAWN and GUS turn around and put the tapes in the players then press play. SHAWN takes the remotes and sits in the chair next to LASSITER.

SHAWN:
Stop. (uses remote and passes it to LASSITER before repeating) Stop. Stop. Stop.

GUS:
These are Jimmy's races. (points to screen) This one is when Juan Carlos died.

SHAWN:
That must be why they're in my head. All of these horses faded down the stretch, as if affected by something. (stands and points at screen) And look here. Juan Carlos is clearly hit by something at the clubhouse turn. He felt the effects immediately, because he's a tiny human person. With the horses, it takes longer for them to feel the effects.

LASSITER:
And your point is?

SHAWN:
Whatever hit Juan Carlos was intended for his horse. What I'm saying is that this was an accident.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, that's a very interesting theory, but it's all circumstantial. We're gonna need some hard evidence.

LASSITER:
(stands) Yeah, but thanks for the A.V. Class. (hits "play" for last tape)

SAUNDER:
(on tape) Youthful Spirit fades down the stretch.
No, wait, he's... he's gaining. It's Youthful Spirit, Youthful Spirit pulls it out.

SHAWN grabs the remote from LASSITER and rewinds the tape to that spot.

SAUNDER:
(on tape) Youthful Spirit fades down the stretch.
No, wait, he's... he's gaining. It's Youthful Spirit, Youthful Spirit pulls it out.

SHAWN:
The announcer! It's the announcer! He sounds surprised. "Neigh," shocked, when Youthful Spirit doesn't fade down the stretch. Listen... (plays tape again)

SAUNDER:
(on tape) Youthful Spirit fades down the stretch.
No, wait, he's... he's gaining. It's Youthful Spirit, Youthful Spirit pulls it out.

SHAWN:
He was expecting something to happen to Juan Carlos's horse. That means he's a part of it. Chief, every psychic nerve in my body tells me that something really big is gonna happen at the Derby tomorrow and that we all need to be there.

VICK:
All right. It's too late to cancel the races, but I can approve a police presence at the track.

EXT. RACE TRACK, TRACK, DAY

The crowds chatter and lean against the rails as the horse begin to parade to the starting gate.

INT. RACE TRACK, GRANDSTAND, DAY

HENRY and SHAWN are at a table, both wearing the "lucky" track shirts.

HENRY:
I've never been in the Jockey Club before, Shawn. Thanks for getting me in here. It's a good thing we wore our lucky shirts, huh?

SHAWN:
Yeah, just worried someone's gonna stare directly at the pattern and have a seizure.

SHAWN leaves HENRY at the table and goes to the lobby level where JULIET and LASSITER are watching.

JULIET:
Shawn, we've had people watching Barry for the last six races, and they haven't seen anything out of the ordinary.

LASSITER:
Admit it, you guys don't have it.

SHAWN walks away, passing GUS.

GUS:
(to LASSITER) Don't worry. We have it. (follows SHAWN and whispers) I don't know if we have it.

SHAWN:
(stops and looks out over track and grandstand) We just gotta figure out how it all connects.

GUS:
So what is this Indian stuff I got off the internet connect to?

SHAWN:
That's what we in the fake psychic community call a hunch.

SAUNDER:
(over speaker) Ladies and gentlemen, the horses have reached the starting gate for the 84th running of the Santa Barbara Derby.

The crowd - including HENRY - stands and cheers. The bell rings.

SAUNDER:
(over speaker) And the race is on. Uh-oh, two horses bump as they come out of the gate. It's the three horse, snare the prize, and the four, biased opinion. Kate's Conscience takes the early lead as the horses reach the first turn. Authority Figure makes a strong move on the inside as the horses race down the backstretch. Authority Figure and Kate's Conscience battle their way past the fall turn. Authority Figure begins to take control.

During the race, SHAWN looks around. His eyes light on PHIL and sees the large bets he placed. He then sees RYAN lower his camera. He remembers how shifty RYAN seemed when he entered the announcer's box to find GUS and SHAWN there. He also remembers how RYAN was the first to administer CPR and how he looked to the side. SHAWN remembers PHIL'S reaction to the incident along with HENRY'S description of the man being a bad gambler on a hot streak. He remembers SAUNDER telling them about how the track is going to close.

SAUNDER:
(over speaker) Authority Figure is almost there...

SHAWN:
(to GUS) Dude, I got it. Get everyone down to the track.

SAUNDER:
(over speaker) And Authority Figure wins with ease.

EXT. RACE TRACK, PADDOCK, DAY

HENRY is talking with GUS when PHIL walks up to them.

PHIL:
I really would like to cash in my tickets now.

SAUNDER:
(interviewing jockey) Well, how did she feel coming around the backstretch?

SHAWN arrives on horseback.

SHAWN:
Everybody hold your horses.

The jockey bends over and hugs his horse, patting its neck.

SHAWN:
I meant metaphorically, but I like the love. I sensed the plan. Hatched from the desperation of watching the track they all love so much shuttered forever. Isn't that right... Barry?

SAUNDER:
Excuse me?

SHAWN:
You are so not excused. You see, the track is closing down this year and Barry finally figured out a way to get paid. But it was the equine who told me he had help. (flashes to SAUNDER, PHIL and RYAN planning what races to fix) Two people with intimate knowledge of the races and access to the entire track. They figured out how to control the outcome of the races by getting rid of the favorites. Because there were only a few horses in the race to begin with, they bet on the rest of the field, and their odds of winning went way up.

SAUNDER:
That is insane. We didn't do anything.

SHAWN:
That's not entirely true. (his horse starts turning around) Whoa, whoa, what's happening here? Gus, little help, buddy.

GUS:
I don't do horses, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Ah, Dale! Dale! (a man takes the reins) Uh... Hold that thought. (dismounts and pats the horse as DALE leads it away) What was I saying?

GUS:
Barry was saying they didn't do anything.

SAUNDER:
No.

SHAWN:
Really? You used Phil to make all the bets on the long shots.

HENRY claps a hand on PHIL'S shoulder as he tries to leave.

SHAWN:
And Ryan here... Well, he took care of knocking out the favorites from his perch in the camera well.

JULIET grips RYAN by the arm as he stands.

JULIET:
With what, his camera?

SHAWN:
Exactly. Lassie, do me a favor. Take that camera off Ryan's neck. Give it a look.

LASSITER takes the camera, looks through it, then removes the lens cap to reveal there is no lens.

LASSITER:
There's no lens. It's some kind of firing mechanism.

SHAWN:
Which is why he didn't follow the horses down the track.

RYAN:
I just wanted to make some money. It was Barry's idea. (points at SAUNDER)

LASSITER pulls RYAN'S arms behind his back and cuffs him.

SHAWN:
I'm getting something. A fraction. 1/5, 1/10, 1/16. (stands by GUS)

GUS:
Barry's 1/16 Choctaw Indian!

SAUNDER:
(mutters) Oh, no!

JULIET cuffs SAUNDER.

SHAWN:
And what are the Choctaw Indians known for? Besides chocodiles.

GUS:
For using blowguns to kill animals with darts dipped in poison.

SHAWN:
Gus shoots and scores. With an assist from Wikipedia.

SHAWN and GUS fist bump. SHAWN continues his big reveal as the action plays out in flashbacks.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
They used darts dipped in ketamine, a horse tranquilizer strong enough to slow down a horse in the middle of a race.

GUS:
With darts small enough to be missed on a 1000-pound horse.

SHAWN:
But the problem was... (v.o.) they accidentally shot Juan Carlos. The ketamine, mixed with all the other drugs in his system, (end v.o.) and the adrenaline from the race killed him. Ryan, (v.o.) you weren't trying to save Juan Carlos's life. You were looking for the evidence. (we see RYAN pull the need from JUAN CARLOS' neck) (end v.o.) And they almost pulled it off by framing poor Jimmy. (v.o.) (we see SAUNDER put the ketamine in JIMMY'S locker) But they couldn't resist one more big pay day in today's race. (end v.o.) It's like my dad always says, "Real men take bubble baths and... a bad gambler never knows when to quit".

HENRY:
Not bad, kid. Not bad.

LASSITER:
Let's go. Get 'em out of here.

LASSITER and JULIET, with the help of uniformed officers, take SAUNDER and RYAN away.

SHAWN:
(claps hands) Now, who wants to take a picture with the winning horse and jockey? Come on, Dad! Gus, get over here.

HENRY and GUS stand on either side of SHAWN in front of the horse.

HENRY:
Hey, I finally get my picture with us in our track shirts. Memories, Shawn. That's what it's all about.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) Just act natural.

GUS:
Yeah.

They make model faces as HENRY smiles and gives a thumbs-up as the photo is taken.

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

JIMMY walks out the front door, followed by SHAWN and GUS. SHAWN is still wearing the lucky track shirt.

JIMMY:
Guys, I don't know what to say. I guess you're not such total fart knockers after all. Thanks.

SHAWN:
That's... so sweet. Gus, isn't there something you wanted to say to Jimmy here?

GUS looks at SHAWN who nods encouragingly.

GUS:
Yes, I do. I've been wanting to say this for a long time. You know, back in school...

JIMMY:
Oh, uh, about that. I had some time to think while I was in jail, and, uh, maybe I didn't treat you guys so good back then. Especially you, Guster. So I'm sorry. I'm sorry for giving you wedgies, swirlies, Jimmy Nickle sandwiches, stuffing you in the trash can and, uh, putting boogers in your clarinet case.

SHAWN:
Whoa!

JIMMY:
(chuckles) Feels good to get that off my chest after all these years.

GUS:
Huh, yeah. I can imagine. Say, Shawn, isn't there something you want to get off of your chest?

SHAWN:
Are you gonna tell him if I don't?

GUS:
What do you think?

SHAWN:
(sighs) All right, Jimmy, here's the thing. I'm the one that ratted you out over the spitball incident. Okay, I'm the one that got you kicked out of school, and I am the one that you should blame for almost ruining your life, it was me.

JIMMY:
(laughs) Almost ruining my life? Yeah, I went to live with my dad in Maui. He let me do anything I wanted. I ate pizza and cookie dough for breakfast. I had a race car bed. I lost my virginity at 13. It was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

A car horn sounds and they turn around to see JANINE standing by the driver's side of the convertible.

JANINE:
(waves) Hi!

SHAWN:
Oh. You two are back together, huh?

JIMMY:
Dude, she's a former Miss Oxnard with no sense of smell, and her dad owns an airport. Course we're back together. Later-o, boys.

JIMMY walks over to meet JANINE halfway. He stands on tip-toes as they kiss passionately. GUS and SHAWN watch, not sure what to make of the couple. As they head back to the car, JIMMY'S hand slides down to her behind.

GUS:
Okay, see, that right there makes total sense in the world.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but we can feel good about solving the case. (pats GUS on the arm)

GUS:
Ehh.

GUS walks away and SHAWN follows.

SHAWN:
Don't you "eh" me. Dude, I broke up a highly intricate race-fixing syndicate while wearing a shirt designed by a monkey coming off a three-day sugar binge.

GUS:
Yes, yes, you did, Shawn. But you still haven't figured out who the second spitter was in Miss Lepky's class. (puts hands on hips smugly and chuckles)

SHAWN:
Gus.

GUS:
Yes?

SHAWN:
You didn't.

GUS:
Yes, I did. (rubs thumb against nose and walks away)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. CLASSROOM, DAY

MISS LEPKY falls and both SHAWN and YOUNG SHAWN turn to look at JIMMY. JIMMY is laughing, a straw at his mouth. They then turn to the other side and see YOUNG GUS quickly close a notebook. He then turns around and give GUS a high five.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN catches up with GUS on the path along the waterfront.

SHAWN:
You did that? And you never told me about it?

GUS:
You don't know all my secrets, Shawn. I guess I too am a man of untold mysteries.

SHAWN:
Burton Guster, I am seeing you in a completely different light. You are, dare I say, dastardly.

GUS:
Hey, I didn't want Miss Lepky to get hurt or anything, but when Jimmy got blamed, my mouth was shut.

SHAWN:
Unbelievable.

GUS:
Face it, Shawn. I am, and always will be, that good. (fist bump) That's why my friends in school used to call me The G.

SHAWN:
That's funny, I thought they called you Big Head Burton.

GUS:
(stops and grabs SHAWN'S arm) Don't you ever say that name. I know it was you that started that.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, Gus. I have a knack for alliteration. I'm a slave to it. Besides, how many words start with B, really?

GUS:
About 1000. How about bold, black, beautiful?

SHAWN:
Who's gonna call you Black Burton?

GUS:
You get my point, Shawn.

SHAWN:
All right. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna buy you an ice cream, and we're gonna discuss some new, fresh to death nicknames. (kneels down and takes money from the pocket of his KangaROOS and stands) How about Burton, the Billowy Bear?

GUS grabs the money and storms off.

SHAWN:
What? I'm... Spitballing. It's my first shot. (follows GUS)

Episode 2x06 Meat Is Murder, But Murder is Also Murder

1987

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

HENRY comes down the stairs in a robe. He looks around and sees a messy counter with a trail of flour heading for the pantry. SHAWN rushes over and picks up a plate of muffins and brings it over.

SHAWN:
Good morning, Dad. I made you some of your favorite banana nut muffins.

HENRY walks over and takes the plate before sitting at the table.

HENRY:
Oh, yeah? Trying to get un-grounded before Robocop comes out on Friday?

SHAWN:
Did I mention I made them all by myself?

HENRY:
(takes a bite) Mmm. Not bad. What recipe did you use?

SHAWN:
My recipe? Uh, I can't tell you that. Um, it's a secret.

HENRY:
Well, let me see if I can guess some of the ingredients that you put in here. Is that a hint of cinnamon that I'm tasting?

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah, just a little.

HENRY:
And I'm detecting just a touch of cilantro... and thyme. Am I right?

SHAWN:
Whoa, Dad, you're really sharp.

HENRY:
Yeah, I am. Gus, you want to come out of the pantry?

The pantry door opens and GUS is wearing an over-sized apron of HENRY'S with the words "Cook 'em, Dano" on it. He's holding a whisk in his hands.

HENRY:
(sighs) Shawn, what have I told you 1,000 times before?

SHAWN:
Don't hide Gus in the pantry?

HENRY:
(sighs) No! A lie always leads to more lies. Instead of lying to me about baking these yourself, and then lying to me about your secret ingredients that you put in, you should have just said that Gus baked these muffins, and I might have let you off the hook.

SHAWN:
Who said Gus made them?

HENRY:
Go to your room.

SHAWN:
I don't know where that is.

HENRY:
Shawn...

SHAWN:
Who's Shawn?

HENRY stands and SHAWN runs up the stairs. GUS makes to follow, but runs back to the table and puts down the whisk before going after SHAWN.

PRESENT DAY

EXT. PARKING LOT, DAY

An older black man steps out of the passenger side of the Echo. He is GUS' UNCLE BURTON.

UNCLE BURTON:
Public parking, huh? Nice to know that my first visit to Santa Barbara isn't a good enough reason for you to pop for a couple of extra bucks for the valet.

GUS:
The restaurant doesn't have valet parking, uncle Burton.

UNCLE BURTON:
Am I gonna need tokens to use the bathroom?

GUS:
It's been well reviewed. It got four spoons.

UNCLE BURTON:
Crack spoons, from the sound of it.

SHAWN runs up behind them.

SHAWN:
Gus, wait up.

GUS:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
Finally. You know, I went to two comic book stores and three women's volleyball games looking for you. Luckily your phone has GPS.

GUS:
You tracked me?

SHAWN:
Yes, I did. With a little help from my friends at your wireless service provider. By the way, they might be calling. They think you're a fugitive from justice. Run with it.

UNCLE BURTON:
Who is this, Burton?

SHAWN:
Shawn Spencer. (shakes UNCLE BURTON'S hand)

GUS:
He knows who you are, he knows what you do. Don't speak. We're going to dinner. You're not invited. Let's roll, Uncle Burton. (takes UNCLE BURTON by the arm and turns to walk away)

SHAWN:
Uh, Jules just called. We've got a case. We should go.

GUS:
You know, Shawn, maybe you should handle this one yourself. There's a first time for everything.

SHAWN:
First time for... What are you talking about?

GUS:
Sorry, Shawn, I can't make it.

GUS shakes his head and tries to get SHAWN to go along by nods and raising his eyebrows.

UNCLE BURTON:
For crying out loud, Burton, the cops are handing you a case. You've gotta take it. You're the only psychic detective they've got.

SHAWN:
That's very funny.

GUS:
Don't speak. Just one minute. (takes SHAWN by the arm and pulls him away from UNCLE BURTON)

UNCLE BURTON:
Yeah.

GUS:
I know what you're thinking.

SHAWN:
Of course you do, you're a psychic detective.

GUS:
A few months ago I was on the phone with my great aunt, who's hard of hearing, and pretty much out of it in general. I told her I was working part-time at a psychic detective agency. She must've misunderstood because now everybody on my mom's side of the family thinks that I'm a psychic detective. And you're...

SHAWN:
Gay?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
German?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Invisible?

GUS:
My assistant, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Wow. Gus, this is, uh... Wow!

GUS:
I know. It's a mess.

SHAWN:
Why don't you just tell him it was a simple misunderstanding?

GUS:
It's too late. I can't come clean now without everyone thinking that I lied to them in the first place. Plus, Uncle Burton has had it out for me ever since I started going by "Gus," even though I'm named after him. If he figures out that I'm not psychic, he's gonna make it his mission to destroy me in front of everybody.

SHAWN:
All right, say no more. You're not getting destroyed by that man.

UNCLE BURTON:
I'm getting hungry over here.

SHAWN:
Don't worry, I have a plan.

GUS:
You do?

SHAWN:
(walks back to UNCLE BURTON) Uncle Burton.

UNCLE BURTON:
Mmm?

SHAWN:
How would you like to come with us, and watch your nephew in action?

UNCLE BURTON:
Tag along with you guys on a real detective case? Yeah. Hey, maybe this won't be the most boring vacation in the world after all. Maybe. (gets in the car)

SHAWN:
(to GUS) I can't wait to watch you work your psychic magic.

INT. WAGNER HOME, LIVING ROOM, DAY

The police are covering the body of Vince Wagner as SHAWN, GUS and UNCLE BURTON arrive.

SHAWN:
So, how you feeling, buddy? A little nervous? Feel something happening in the belly? Maybe you should do some of your Lamaze breathing.

GUS:
No, you know why, Shawn? Because your little plan to embarrass me isn't gonna work. As soon as the cops see Uncle Burton hanging around, they're gonna kick him right out. Nice try, Shawny boy.

BUZZ walks in from the kitchen.

BUZZ:
Hey, guys.

SHAWN:
Ah, Buzz.

BUZZ:
You know, I'm not sure they're gonna want you having any guests in here. I mean, since it's a crime scene and all.

UNCLE BURTON:
No, it's not.

BUZZ:
It's not?

UNCLE BURTON:
(steps forward until he's face-to-face with BUZZ) No. There's no crime-scene tape at the door, the forensic guys are not collecting any evidence, and it seems as though you guys don't suspect foul play, so I've got as much right to be here as you do. (BUZZ opens his mouth to talk) And don't give me any of that fancy police talk, please. I've seen enough Hill Street Blues to know what's what.

GUS tries to signal BUZZ to kick them out.

BUZZ:
I gotta go. (walks away)

UNCLE BURTON:
Mmm.

UNCLE BURTON looks smugly at GUS just as JULIET enters from the kitchen.

JULIET:
Hey, thanks for coming so quick. Who's this?

GUS:
This is my uncle Burton, from New Jersey. Shawn invited him.

JULIET:
(shakes UNCLE BURTONS'S hand) Very nice to meet you, Uncle (looks at GUS) Burton?

UNCLE BURTON:
His mother named him after me. It's not a very common name, but some of us still use it proudly.

SHAWN:
Jules, what's the skinny? What do you got?

JULIET:
Vince Wagner, longtime restaurant critic at the Santa Barbara Mirror, died suddenly after eating his wife's chicken soup. All signs point to natural causes, but the wife's acting a little suspicious. I want to make sure I didn't miss anything, so I'd like for you to get a reading on her.

SHAWN:
Then that's what we will do. (motions to include GUS)

JULIET:
She's in the den. (walks away)

SHAWN:
Finally a chance to see Gus' psychic powers at work. (starts to follow after JULIET)

GUS:
(takes SHAWN'S arm) Shawn, can I speak to you for a second?

INT. WAGNER HOME, KITCHEN, DAY

GUS pushes SHAWN ahead of him into the empty kitchen.

SHAWN:
What is the problem here?

GUS:
Stop playing, Shawn. You know I can't do this!

SHAWN:
Yes, you can.

GUS:
No, I can't.

SHAWN:
You make some observations, you form a conclusion, and you reveal it to everybody in a ridiculous and/or roundabout way.

GUS:
What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
I'll show you.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(opens cabinets) Uh-huh. (checks microwave) Whoa. (opens fridge) Oh!

Inside the fridge he spots a stack of take-out containers. He closes the fridge and turns around. He notices raw chicken next to vegetables on the counter as well as a scorched pot on the stove.

SHAWN:
Raw chicken next to vegetables, charred pots, and a refrigerator full of take-out containers. What does that tell you about the wife?

GUS:
I don't know. She sucks at cooking.

SHAWN:
Oh, you're on fire.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(opens the door) Uncle Burton, come quick! It's happening!

GUS:
(grabs SHAWN and pulls him back) Shawn, stop it. Stop playing!

SHAWN:
Put your hand to your head. It really helps sell the thing.

GUS:
I'm not doing it, Shawn.

UNCLE BURTON enters the room.

UNCLE BURTON:
This better be worth skipping dinner for.

GUS puts his fingers to his temples in imitation of SHAWN.

SHAWN:
He's a psychic wildebeest.

GUS:
I'm... I'm seeing something. I'm sensing something.

GUS looks over at SHAWN who mimics tasting something while facing away from UNCLE BURTON.

GUS:
I'm tasting something. (gags) It tastes bad. She's a bad cook!

MRS. WAGNER:
(from den) You sound just like my husband.

They go out the door to the den.

INT. WAGNER HOME, DEN, DAY

MRS. WAGNER is standing by the fireplace, a glass of wine in her hand.

SHAWN:
Mrs. Wagner? Oh, please, excuse my partner. His psychic visions are often terribly impolite.

MRS. WAGNER:
No need to apologize. I really am a terrible cook. (sits)

GUS:
(sits across from her) I'm very sorry for your loss. I'm sensing that you're at peace with your husband's passing.

SHAWN sits on the chair next to her. UNCLE BURTON perches on the arm of GUS' chair.

MRS. WAGNER:
Well, not exactly at peace. But it wasn't easy being married to a food critic. He rated everything I did.

SHAWN:
Surely he couldn't have rated everything.

SHAWN and GUS share a chuckle. MRS. WAGNER nods sadly.

MRS. WAGNER:
I never broke two stars.

SHAWN:
Well, that's awfully harsh.

GUS:
So why did you keep on cooking for him?

MRS. WAGNER:
Health reasons. He had gotten a worrisome checkup from his doctor recently, he ate out every day for his job, and always brought the leftovers home, so I started making him healthy, home-cooked meals just once a week. That's what dinner was tonight.

GUS:
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Wagner. You have our condolences.

GUS and SHAWN stand and walk away from MRS. WAGNER and UNCLE BURTON and towards the living room.

SHAWN:
(sighs) She didn't kill him. If she wanted him dead, she wouldn't have cooked him healthy meals once a week.

GUS:
Great, let's just tell the police, and get Uncle Burton out of here before they ask us anything else.

WAGNER'S body is on a gurney in a body bag. Before the bag is zipped closed, SHAWN notices that WAGNER'S tongue is black.

GUS:
Uncle Burton?

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN walks towards the office, a paper bag in his hand. He goes inside.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS opens the blinds as SHAWN enters.

SHAWN:
All right, check it out. (empties paper bag onto his desk - lollipops) I went to Candy Emporium, this time for research. There are over 100 flavors of lollipop on the market, not one of which turns your tongue black. Can you believe that?

GUS:
What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
Right before we left, I caught a quick glimpse of the critic's mouth. His tongue was coated black. Now, what else could possibly cause something like that?

GUS:
Bismuth subsalicylate.

SHAWN:
That dude that used to play for the Mavericks?

GUS:
No, Shawn, it's the active ingredient in those pink stomach medications. He must've had some. Look, let's talk about this later. My uncle is... (motions towards the outer office)

SHAWN:
Gus. The critic was murdered.

GUS:
I thought you said the wife didn't kill him.

SHAWN:
She didn't. He was complaining of an upset stomach before dinner. He asked for chicken soup. That's the ultimate "I'm feeling sick" meal. Except, of course, for a tub of bacon grease and hotdog water. But usually...

UNCLE BURTON enters the room.

UNCLE BURTON:
Shawn, this place is a sty. Maybe you ought to tidy up once in a while, huh? Or did you forget that you're the assistant?

SHAWN:
You are absolutely right, sir. (looks at GUS) The person who's not the psychic detective should be in charge all the cleaning. It just makes sense. Meanwhile, Gus here has new psychic knowledge about yesterday's case.

UNCLE BURTON:
Yeah?

GUS:
No, I don't, Shawn. I mean, I shouldn't spend so much time working when I've got family in town.

UNCLE BURTON:
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Burton. You think Diagnosis Murder ever let family get in the way of his work? (puts a lollipop in his mouth)

SHAWN:
Another excellent point. I bet Diagnosis Murder never did that. Go ahead, Gus, call up on the spirits. Ask them what happened to the dead critic.

GUS:
Fine. (walks in front of SHAWN'S desk and begins to take deep breaths before starting to chant) Oh, spirits always willing to lend a helping hand.

SHAWN and UNCLE BURTON stand next to each other behind GUS' back.

UNCLE BURTON:
This psychic stuff can get a little wimpy, huh?

SHAWN:
At least he's not doing it in the tutu and Capezios.

GUS:
(dramatically) I asked you to help me solve the murder of Vince Wagner. Show me what transpired.

GUS spins around to face his uncle and SHAWN. SHAWN has moved behind UNCLE BURTON and begins to mime his theory for GUS. He mimes, eating, typing and stretching

GUS:
I'm seeing something.

SHAWN then mimes an argument and beating someone.

GUS:
I'm seeing... I'm seeing... I don't know what I'm seeing. Wait, wait. It's coming clearer now.

SHAWN pretends to be a waiter, placing a towel over his arm like a cloth.

GUS:
Somebody put something in his food at a restaurant.

SHAWN then mimes being sick to his stomach.

GUS:
And that is what made him sick.

SHAWN then crosses his arms and jerks.

GUS:
Sick to the point of having a seizure.

SHAWN:
(mouths) No!

GUS:
No, no, no. That's what killed...

SHAWN touches the tip of his nose to say GUS had it right.

GUS:
That's what killed his nose.

SHAWN:
(mouths incredulously) Killed his nose?

UNCLE BURTON:
What?

SHAWN crosses his arms, closes his eyes and turns his head.

GUS:
That's what killed him.

SHAWN:
Whoo! Gus, you are so amazing with that stuff. If it wasn't for his psychic talents, I'd have to get some lame job at a pharmaceutical company or something.

GUS:
That happens to be a very exciting industry, Shawn. Now let's go and tell the police our new revelation. Uncle Burton, wait here.

UNCLE BURTON:
No way. If I wanted to sit alone in a dirty room, I'd have stayed at home with my wife. (chuckles) I'm going with you guys. (leaves)

SHAWN:
(whispers) "Killed his nose"?

GUS:
You didn't... You went like this.

SHAWN:
What's wrong with you? How do you kill a nose?!

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

UNCLE BURTON fills out the forms for a Visitor's Pass as SHAWN and GUS continue inside.

GUS:
Shawn, that visitor's badge is not gonna hold him up for long. I can't be psychic in front of the cops.

SHAWN:
Don't worry, I have a plan. I'm gonna go in Vick's office. You wait here.

GUS:
For what?

SHAWN:
My signal. The stuff you did in the office, genius, all of it. But I wanted you to say "poison," Gus. Poison. Get it right this time.

GUS:
This time? Shawn, what are you about to...

SHAWN:
(harsh whisper) There's no time to explain! (enters VICK'S office)

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK is sitting at her desk. LASSITER leans against the other open door jamb, arm in a sling. JULIET stands next to him.

SHAWN:
(speaks gibberish) Ham pencils! Sheila E. Tomato bark! Velvety shark toast... Shark toast!

VICK:
Is there something wrong with you, Mr. Spencer?

LASSITER:
You picked today to ask him that question?

SHAWN:
Dude, Lassie, what happened to your arm?

LASSITER:
I don't want to talk about it.

JULIET:
He won't tell us either. And what were you saying when you came in? I couldn't understand any of it.

SHAWN:
Oh, Jules, it's this case. These visions I'm having, they're so intense, I can't even describe them. Every time I open my mouth, the wrong fishes come out!

JULIET:
You mean "words"?

SHAWN:
Isn't that what I said? Oh, no. If only there were someone here that could translate. You know, someone who's known me so long they understand everything I say. Someone just slightly less handsome than I am. (sees GUS peering through the window) Gus! Perfect. This is perfect. Gus, Gus, get in here.

GUS:
(enters) What?

SHAWN:
Oh, mambo beef puddles! (staggers) Swirly-whirly jungle pants! (pants) Quick, translate that into normal words for us.

UNCLE BURTON enters, fingering his Visitor's Pass.

UNCLE BURTON:
Man, they made me fill this thing out for six pages of paper work, and they didn't put my picture on it.

LASSITER:
Sorry, who are you?

SHAWN:
No one ask any more questions. No one. Concentrate, Gus. Tell us that all this means.

GUS:
Swirly-whirly jungle pants. It means the critic ate something he wasn't supposed to. Two bones and a skull.

JULIET:
Two bones and a skull. Poison!

GUS:
Yes. The critic was poisoned.

UNCLE BURTON:
Man, this is better than Ghost Whisperer.

LASSITER:
Guys, we checked the wife's soup. It's clean. And wait, am I now supposed to believe that Guster here...

SHAWN:
Carnival stud muffin. Huh?

VICK:
What?

GUS:
It wasn't the wife. The critic was poisoned at a restaurant.

SHAWN:
Now, that makes sense. Wagner was pretty harsh on his own wife's cooking. He was probably even harder on the restaurants he reviewed. He could have easily been poisoned by a chef who got a bad review.

UNCLE BURTON:
Mmm-hmm.

VICK:
Do you think so?

TRIO:
Yes!

VICK:
Okay. Call the lab. I want a tox report on my desk ASAP.

LASSITER:
You're actually listening to this?

VICK:
Well, we've gotten information in stranger ways before. Never hurts to check it out.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

UNCLE BURTON, SHAWN and GUS exit VICK'S office.

UNCLE BURTON:
Burton, that was fantastic. How do you do that stuff?

SHAWN:
He can't talk tight now, Uncle Burton. Psychic episodes like that leave him very, very parched.

GUS:
You see...

UNCLE BURTON:
No, no, no, let me get you some water. (goes for water)

SHAWN:
Down those stairs, around the corner.

GUS:
(to UNCLE BURTON) Thank you. (to SHAWN) What do we do now?

SHAWN:
We've gotta figure out what that critic ate. If he was poisoned by a chef, it had to have been something he consumed in the 24 hours leading up to his death.

GUS:
How do we do that?

SHAWN:
Well, Wagner's wife said he brought all of his
leftovers home, right? The refrigerator was packed with take-out containers. The one on top was probably the most recent. The restaurant it came from was... (remembers a label bearing an "A" in flowing calligraphy) The curvy A.

GUS:
"The curvy A"? That doesn't sound like a place that serves food, Shawn.

SHAWN:
It's not the name, it's the symbol on top of the box. Come on, man, you eat out all the time. What place has a big, swoopy, curving A?

GUS:
I don't know. What does it look like?

SHAWN takes a pen from his pocket and commences to draw on GUS' palm. When done, he holds it up for GUS to see.

GUS:
Antonio's.

SHAWN:
Sweet!

GUS:
Why did you write on my hand?!

SHAWN:
Why would I write on my own hand? This thing is totally permanent. (leaves)

GUS:
Wha... Shawn!

INT. ANTONIO'S, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the busy kitchen from the dining area.

GUS:
Let's make this quick before Uncle Burton starts thinking we're sticking him with the check.

ANTONIO:
Fire up the entrees for the eight-top.

COOK:
You got it, Chef.

ANTONIO:
Mario, where are my starters? Hurry up!

MARIO:
Almost ready.

SHAWN:
Hey, Chef Antonio. We'd like to ask you a couple questions.

ANTONIO:
(looks up from slicing) Sorry, guys, no customers allowed in the kitchen, okay? Area fresca.

GUS:
No, we're not customers.

SHAWN:
We're from the health department. (flashes a fake badge) Here for a surprise inspection.

ANTONIO:
Again? We just had the surprise inspection a few days ago. Why, is there a problem?

SHAWN:
Yes. You weren't surprised enough.

ANTONIO:
Let's make this quick. (motions as he talks and walks) Walls and the floor are clean. Drainage is clear. Hand washing station is stocked with soap and clean towels. Dry food storage over there, walk-in freezer over here.

ANTONIO opens the freezer door and SHAWN and GUS peer around the door.

GUS:
Looks good.

ANTONIO:
Aren't you supposed to check the temperature?

SHAWN:
Of course. Gus, go ahead, check the temperature.

GUS:
Me? Why do I have to do it?

SHAWN:
Dude, I'm wearing short sleeves.

GUS:
Okay. (pushes SHAWN aside and walks into freezer)

SHAWN:
So did you hear what happened to the food critic down at the Mirror? That's some nasty business, huh?

ANTONIO:
Sure, I heard about Wagner. I don't say I'm sad. Ten years I've been working in this town, that man never gave my food a good review.

They walk away from the freezer and GUS closes it behind him.

SHAWN:
Sounds like you're not very fond of the guy.

ANTONIO:
Vince Wagner made my life miserable with his asinine reviews. Honestly, I am glad that that bastard is dead!

LASSITER:
Chef Antonio!

ANTONIO turns around to see LASSITER and JULIET enter the kitchen with a couple of uniformed police.

LASSITER:
You're under arrest for the murder of Vince Wagner. Take him.

One of the officers takes ANTONIO and ushers him out of the room.

ANTONIO:
Murder? Is this a joke? I... Who put you up to this? Get your hands off...

SHAWN:
Jules, what's going on here?

JULIET:
Tox screen came back positive. Apparently Wagner ate a poisonous mushroom called the "death cap."

SHAWN:
What are you saying?

LASSITER:
There were death caps in the mushroom risotto Wagner ate here the day before he died. We found the leftovers in his fridge.

JULIET:
Looks like you were right, Shawn. Or Gus. Or whoever.

LASSITER and JULIET leave.

GUS:
What a relief. We caught the guy, we solved the case, and best of all, I don't have to be psychic anymore.

SHAWN looks at the counter and sees the mushrooms sliced into strips. He then remembers the mushrooms for the leftovers were cubed.

SHAWN:
Uh-oh.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
We got the wrong guy. Man.

SHAWN leaves and GUS follows.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are trying to convince LASSITER that he arrested the wrong person.

LASSITER:
Guys, it's not that complicated. Whenever a critic eats at his restaurant, Antonio prepares the meal himself.

SHAWN:
Not this time. The mushrooms in the take-out container were cut into cubes. Antonio cuts his mushrooms into strips. Lassie, I have a really strong vibe he didn't do this.

LASSITER:
Look, we know Antonio hated Wagner. Wagner died from eating his risotto. We have the risotto. We even have Wagner's notes proving he ate the risotto. It's a slam dunk.

LASSITER picks up a spray bottle and turns to spritz a plant. SHAWN sees Wagner's journal on LASSITER'S desk. One of the comments is that the risotto was tepid.

SHAWN:
(whispers) That's Wagner's notebook. It says the risotto was cold.

GUS:
So?

SHAWN:
So... (LASSITER comes back) Whoa! The sandpaper was the banana patch!

GUS:
I think he means the risotto was cold.

SHAWN:
Thank you, Gus.

GUS:
You're welcome.

SHAWN:
Why would food be served cold at a five-star restaurant, unless... Unless the poisoned food was cooked somewhere else?

LASSITER:
You know what I think? Case is closed.

UNCLE BURTON joins them as LASSITER leaves.

UNCLE BURTON:
Hey, guys. I want to thank you for an incredible day, Burton. (shakes GUS' hand) You're a regular Rockford Files. (laughs and walks towards the exit)

GUS:
(looks at his hand) Did my uncle just thank me for an incredible day?

SHAWN:
A more important question, how much TV does he watch?

GUS:
I'm serious, Shawn. My cousin took him to the Super Bowl on a helicopter, and he never even thanked him for that.

SHAWN:
I'm serious too. He's like this crazy, tank-shaped encyclopedia of detective shows. I bet he even saw Manimal.

GUS:
You're right.

SHAWN:
About Manimal?

GUS:
Shawn, we have to solve this case before he leaves.

SHAWN:
Why?

GUS:
Because, I think I've finally figured out how to get back on his good side. I've been seeking Uncle Burton's approval all my life. He's mean to everybody. But ever since he started tagging along on this case, he's been kind of nice to me. You know why?

SHAWN:
You don't have the braids anymore.

GUS:
He likes detective shows if I could solve this case before he leaves, he may finally get over the whole Gus-Burton thing. But I'm gonna need your help.

SHAWN:
All right, fine, Mr. Psychic Detective. Tell me, since Antonio clearly didn't kill the critic, who did?

GUS:
I don't know. Maybe we should find out if anyone else hated him. See who else may have had a motive.

SHAWN:
Sshh!

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
You're gonna start a crime-fighting revolution with talk like that. (rolls eyes and walks away)

GUS:
Shawn, you say stuff like that all the time! (follows SHAWN)

INT. SANTA BARBARA MIRROR, NEWSROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS speak with the editor.

SHAWN:
Phil Pritikin, Mr. Editor-in-chief. Shawn Spencer. Long-time reader, first-time caller.

PRITKIN walks away followed by his assistant, NICK. SHAWN and GUS go after them.

PRITKIN:
What's going on with the Sunday spread?

NICK:
Layout's waiting for your approval on the mock-up.

SHAWN:
"Mock-up," funny word. Like I was saying...

PRITKIN:
Where' Salazar's alderman story?

NICK:
She's typing it up. Do you want copy to read it first?

PRITKIN:
No, just send it straight here. (stops to sign a form for another employee) Anything else? (continues)

SHAWN:
You know, Phil, now that you mention it, I would very much like...

PRITKIN:
Does he work here?

NICK:
I don't believe so, sir.

PRITKIN:
Son, I'm a busy man. If you don't work for me, I don't have the time. (enters office followed by NICK)

SHAWN:
I just have a question about Vince Wagner.

NICK:
Cooper, these guys got questions. (shuts the door)

SHAWN:
(through the window) Oh, I also have an idea for a crossover strip, where Dilbert finally meets Marmaduke.

Another man, COOPER, comes up behind them.

COOPER:
Did you guys need something?

GUS and SHAWN turn around.

GUS:
Hi, I'm Burton Guster, with the SBPD. We're investigating the murder of Vince Wagner.

COOPER:
I'm Cooper. I was Mr. Wagner's assistant.

GUS:
Great. Maybe you could help us out. Do you know of anyone who may have had a grudge against your boss?

COOPER:
Are you serious?

>>>LATER>>>

COOPER is sitting at his desk and pulls out a large binder labeled "Angry Chef Letters".

COOPER:
We call them the angry chef letters. Every chef who ever got a bad review would write a nasty letter to Mr. Wagner about it.

GUS:
So you're saying this is all hate mail?

COOPER:
I don't know if I'd call it all hate mail. It ranges from "mild dislike" mail to "extreme abhorrence" mail.

SHAWN:
How about "I wish you were dead" mail?

COOPER:
Oh, we have those too. Back here. (shows another section of the binder)

SHAWN:
Any one of these chefs could have cooked the poison risotto and snuck it into Antonio's restaurant.

GUS:
You're right. We should talk to all these chefs before they open for business. Call the restaurants and make a reservation. For justice.

SHAWN:
Is justice the time or the number of people in our party?

GUS:
Just call 'em. And make it for three. Uncle Burton's coming.

SHAWN:
All right.

INT. SOUTHERN RESTAURANT, KITCHEN, DAY

The CHEF is making jambalaya as SHAWN, GUS and UNCLE BURTON watch.

GUS:
(grabs SHAWN and pulls him back) So what did you think of Vince Wagner?

CHEF 1:
Looky here. He was a jackass. You know what he called my award-winning jambalaya? "Jumba-lousy!" (sets a plate in front of them) Now tell me if this ain't the best damn jambalaya you've never had in your life.

All three pick up a fork and start eating.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT, DAY

The CHEF removes the tray as the trio begins to eat.

CHEF 2:
You know what he wrote in his review of my famous miso yellow tail roll? "Miso disappointed."

The three laugh.

CHEF 2:
Don't laugh. It's not funny.

SHAWN:
No, it's not.

INT. BAKERY RESTAURANT, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and UNCLE BURTON devour cake.

CHEF 3:
Let's put it this way. He once referred to my white chocolate tiramisu as "ass cake".

SHAWN:
Oh, now that just seems mean.

INT. SOUTHERN RESTAURANT, KITCHEN, DAY

The three are eating barbecue

CHEF 1:
I didn't kill him. I was here that night cookin'. Had a bunch of big groups. Never even left the kitchen.

UNCLE BURTON:
Mmm-hmm.

SHAWN:
Mmm. Yeah.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT, DAY

They have moved on to eating noodles.

CHEF 2:
I was either in the kitchen or out here talking to customers. I own this place. I have to watch over everything. Every bowl, every noodle, every chopstick...

INT. BAKERY RESTAURANT, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and UNCLE BURTON are now eating a different dessert.

CHEF 3:
I didn't kill him. I definitely thought about it a couple of times. I could never figure out why that guy was so angry. He ate out at fancy restaurants all the time for free, and still, all he did was complain.

UNCLE BURTON, with cream on his beard, turns to GUS and whispers to him.

UNCLE BURTON:
Ask her some more questions. Maybe she'll give us some cookies.

GUS points at him in agreement.

INT. SEAFOOD RESTAURANT, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and UNCLE BURTON eating lobster.

CHEF 4:
I'm confused. Why are you here? Wagner never even reviewed my restaurant.

A waiter brings a fresh lobster and SHAWN passes his demolished plate to the CHEF.

SHAWN:
Oh, make it right. There it is.

EXT. SEAFOOD RESTAURANT, DAY

They exit the restaurant. GUS and UNCLE BURTON rub their full stomachs.

SHAWN:
That was, without question, the tastiest dead-end we have ever gone down.

GUS:
Well, at least it wasn't a complete waste of our time. It seems to me like any of these chefs were way too busy to murder the critic.

UNCLE BURTON:
Matlock never ate this good. I'm going back to the car and unbutton my pants. (leaves)

GUS:
You know, I've been thinking about what that dessert chef said. Wagner got to eat out at fancy restaurants every day on the newspaper's dime. If I was him, I'd be happy. I mean, who wouldn't want to have that job?

SHAWN:
That's a good point. That's a really good point, Gus. I think you're right. We were wrong about the chefs. Maybe this wasn't about revenge at all. Maybe this was about somebody wanting the restaurant critic's job.

GUS:
Someone who works at the newspaper.

SHAWN:
Exactly. We need to get down there and talk to the editor.

GUS:
Wait, wait, Shawn, he's not gonna talk to us. He doesn't talk to anybody who doesn't work for him.

SHAWN:
I don't think that will be a problem. (crosses the street)

INT. SANTA BARBARA MIRROR, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

PRITKIN is sitting at the head of the table with his editors around the table. SHAWN prepares to work his magic. He notices one woman's watch is set to a different time from the clock on the wall. One man has a distinctive stain on his shoulder. Another man's leg pumps up and down nervously. PRITKIN has a mark on his right hand.

SHAWN:
Okay, I think I have something here. (points to PRITKIN) You, sir, are left-handed. You have a new baby at home, you just covered a story somewhere in the Midwest, and you, you just really, really need to pee. Just go.

The man runs from the room.

PRITKIN:
All right, you convinced me. (stands and shakes SHAWN'S hand) Congratulations, you're our new astrological forecaster. Now get out of here. You've got a job to do. You've got a deadline to meet.

INT. SANTA BARBARA MIRROR, NEWSROOM, DAY

SHAWN is sitting at a desk, his feet up, and playing with a Rubik's Cube. GUS walks over.

SHAWN:
(looks up) Hey, dude. Did you read my horoscopes?

GUS:
Yes. They're terrible. Horoscopes are supposed to be vague, so that people can interpret them to mean whatever they want. Yours are all way too specific.

SHAWN:
I wrote them with specific people in mind.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is sitting at her desk reading the paper. She finds the horoscopes and reads out loud.

JULIET:
(to LASSITER) "Aries: calcium is especially important to you right now, Mr. Salt & Pepper hair with a maroon car. There may also be a promotion in your future. Try walking backwards through doorways for good luck." Carlton, are you expecting a promotion?

LASSITER:
No. Come on, O'Hara, don't be so naive. It's a horoscope. It's nonsense.

VICK:
Detective Lassiter, may I have a word?

LASSITER:
Of course.

LASSITER crosses the hall to VICK'S office. He pauses before going in, turning around to look at everyone as he walks into the office backwards.

JULIET:
Let's see, what's mine? "Libra: Your one true love will be wearing sneakers and an Apple Jacks tee shirt." That's kind of a weird detail.

INT. SANTA BARBARA MIRROR, PRITKIN'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN, wearing an Apple Jacks T-shirt enter the office followed by GUS. PRITKIN is sitting at his desk looking over copy.

SHAWN:
Phil, heya. Wondering if I could ask you a couple questions about this restaurant critic job.

PRITKIN:
Great, you too?

SHAWN:
Sorry?

PRITKIN:
Everybody, from the ombudsman to the delivery boy wants to be the new restaurant critic. I know it's the cushiest gig in all of journalism, but I hired you to write horoscopes, and that's what I expect you to do.

SHAWN:
Whoa, Phil, I think you're getting the wrong idea. I just could sense that you're totally swamped. I figured I'd come on in, offer up my soothsayer services... Sayer services?

GUS:
Sooth services.

SHAWN:
Sooth services to help you pick the best candidate for the job.

PRITKIN:
I guess you are pretty sharp. Applications are over there. Keep it quiet though. Every single person who works here is playing some sort of angle to get the restaurant critic job.

As GUS goes to check the applications, the NICK sticks his head in the other door, a bag of Cheetos in his hand.

NICK:
Sir, meeting in five. (PRITKIN checks his watch) You know, these Cheetos are so crispy, yet airy. And its subtle flavor is such a wonderful contrast to its eye-catching color.

PRITKIN:
(stands) I get it! (to SHAWN and GUS as he passes) Every day with the Cheetos. (leaves)

GUS grabs the pile of applications from the shelf

GUS:
Shawn, there is 100 applications in here. That's 100 suspects. My uncle's flight leaves today. We don't have time to talk to 100 people, Shawn.

SHAWN:
We don't need to. We just need to talk to the one guy that can link one of those people to the murder weapon.

GUS:
And who's that?

EXT. MUSHROOM FARM, DAY

MOONEY, a mushroom farmer, sits at a table viewing a mushroom through a magnifying glass before eating it. SHAWN and GUS sit opposite him.

MOONEY:
Mmm. Mmm. Delicious.

GUS:
(whispers to SHAWN) Are you sure about this guy?

SHAWN:
(whispers to GUS) He's the only mushroom farmer in the tri-county area. If anyone can help us, he can. (normal voice) Mr. Mooney, thanks again for taking the time to speak with us. So, how many types of mushrooms do you grow here?

MOONEY:
A couple of hundred, depending on the season.

GUS:
Does that include a mushroom called the "death cap"?

MOONEY:
The death cap? Heck no, man, those things are poisonous. Besides, they only grow in the wild.

SHAWN:
Well, let's say we were looking for the death cap around here. Where would we find it?

MOONEY:
Well, I know a few places in the hills. Why do you ask?

SHAWN:
Why do you ask why do I ask?

They laugh lightly.

MOONEY:
Why do you ask why do I ask why do you ask?

SHAWN:
Why do you ask why do I ask why do you ask why do...

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
I'm... I'm just curious.

MOONEY:
Yeah, well, a guy came in here a couple of weeks ago, and he had the exact same question.

GUS:
Do you remember this person's name?

MOONEY:
Can't say that I do, but I remember exactly what he looked like.

SHAWN steeples his hands and leans forward.

GUS:
Can you give us a description?

MOONEY:
Yeah, okay, man. The guy was about nine-feet tall, right. He had sunshine coming out of his mouth, and he had a hippopotamus for a hand.

GUS:
I don't think I have any more questions.

SHAWN:
Yep, that'll do it.

They get up.

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk towards the building from the car. GUS is on his cell.

GUS:
Okay, Uncle Burton, just let me know when you're all packed up, and I'll pick you up and take you to the airport. All right. (ends call)  We spent two hours riding up to that mushroom farm, and we're right back to when we started.

SHAWN:
Oh. (opens door)

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

They walk through to the inner office.

SHAWN:
Don't be such a gloomy you, Gus. Look at the bright side. Now we know the killer is a he.

GUS:
And that he has a hippopotamus for a hand? That helps us out a lot.

HENRY is sitting at SHAWN'S desk, feet up on the desk, newspaper in hand.

SHAWN:
Whoa! Dad, what are you doing here?

HENRY:
(reads) "Sagittarius: Please return the bb gun you confiscated from your son in the second grade. P.S., you are a cranky-pants."

SHAWN:
That's an amazing coincidence. Didn't you confiscate a bb gun from me in the second grade?

HENRY:
(takes his feet down and bends over to lift a box onto the desk) Look, Shawn, here's your stuff. Next time you want something from me, be an adult and ask for it. (stands) Passing yourself off as a psychic, that's bad enough. But horoscopes? Shawn... Shawn! What if some idiot out there reads this crap and decides to take it seriously?

SHAWN:
Dad, it clearly states that astrological forecasts are for entertainment purposes only. Besides, I only took the job for a case.

GUS:
We're investigating the restaurant critic murder. The cops already have a suspect, but we're pretty sure that Chef Antonio was framed.

HENRY:
Then I assume you know all about the veggie burger incident.

SHAWN:
(scoffs) Of course we know about the veggie burger incident, Dad. We're professional detectives. (turns his head) Gus?

GUS:
Googling it. (goes to his desk and starts researching)

HENRY:
Shawn, you know, maybe instead of wasting your time writing this garbage for the newspaper, you might try reading it once in a while. A couple of months ago, vegetarian customers at Antonio's restaurant started complaining about how bland the vegetarian burgers were. In my personal opinion, you eat a burger without beef in it...

BOTH:
...you've lost the right to complain about flavor.

SHAWN:
I've heard that speech before. Just call someone a hippie and get to the point.

HENRY:
The point is Antonio decided to make the burgers tastier by adding beef broth to the recipe. Oh, great, all the complaints stopped, till some crazed vegan lady...

GUS:
By the name of Dwyer?

HENRY:
... found out about it, and started organizing boycotts against Antonio's restaurant. They've been feuding ever since.

SHAWN:
This guy secretly fed beef to vegetarians? Why are we trying to get him out of jail?

GUS:
Because he didn't kill the critic. Take a look at this article, Shawn. (SHAWN walks over) She advocates any action to put Chef Antonio out of business for the veggie burger incident. She calls herself the Vegan Vigilante.

SHAWN:
How very villainous of her. You think she could've framed Antonio for Wagner's death or what?

GUS:
Only one way to find out. Do you know where this Dwyer lady might be?

HENRY:
Sure, I saw her at the drive-thru a couple of days ago.

SHAWN:
That's very helpful, Dad. What makes you think she'll be there today?

EXT. DRIVE-THRU RESTAURANT, DAY

DWYER has chained herself to the signpost. Others picket with signs and chant slogans.

DWYER:
Meat is murder! Stop eating your fellow creatures! All animals have got the right to live! Meat is murder!

SHAWN and GUS watch from the side.

SHAWN:
I hate it when my dad's right.

DWYER:
Stop eating your fellow creatures! All animals have got the right to live.

GUS and SHAWN approach DWYER.

SHAWN:
Yo, Vegan Vigilante lady. How long have you been out here?

DWYER:
Three days.

GUS:
We heard that you had a grudge with Chef Antonio. Were you near his restaurant recently?

DWYER:
Yeah, I led a protest outside of his place on Tuesday night.

GUS:
Tuesday night?

SHAWN:
Excuse us.

SHAWN and GUS walk away from DWYER.

GUS:
That was the same night the critic was poisoned.

SHAWN:
Dude, I think we just found our killer.

GUS:
Nice.

They do a little victory dance.

LASSITER:
Detective Lassiter, SBPD! Who's in charge of this freak fest?

SHAWN and GUS turn around to see LASSITER and JULIET approaching.

JULIET:
Guys, we got your message. Will you please tell us what this has to do with the... case? (sees SHAWN'S shirt) Nice shirt.

SHAWN:
Thanks.

JULIET:
Did you buy that today by any chance?

SHAWN:
This old rag? Nah. I've had this thing for just about forever. Remember when I sent off those cereal box tops to get this thing?

GUS:
You didn't do that.

SHAWN:
Sure I did.

GUS:
No, you didn't.

SHAWN:
It was the same year you got your first Cabbage Patch...

GUS:
(jabs SHAWN in the side) Shut up. I remember.

SHAWN:
Why do you ask, Jules?

JULIET:
No reason.

LASSITER joins them.

LASSITER:
All right, this whack job is in violation of at least six different municipal codes, and she smells like curly fries. I say we cut her loose, take her down. Where's the restaurant manager?

SHAWN:
He's probably inside managing the restaurant.

LASSITER:
Copy that.

They watch as LASSITER walks towards the restaurant entrance.

SHAWN:
Wait for it. Wait for it...

LASSITER pauses at the door and turns around. He sees the others looking at him.

SHAWN:
Is there a problem?

LASSITER:
No, no, I'm just... making sure I'm not being followed. A good cop... (points at his eyes) always aware of his surroundings.

SHAWN mimics the motion. LASSITER enters backwards and we hear crashing.

JULIET:
I better go help him. (leaves)

A taxi arrives and a man steps out. GUS sees him first.

GUS:
(to SHAWN) Uncle Burton.

UNCLE BURTON:
(walks over) Burton, I got here as soon as I could. Who are all these strange people?

GUS:
It's all a part of our investigation. We had to come check out a lead. Thanks for meeting me down here.

UNCLE BURTON:
Oh, no problem. That ride in the cab gave me a chance to fill out this postcard letting everybody in the family know about our psychic detective.

UNCLE BURTON pokes GUS in the chest and laughs. SHAWN pats him on the back.

GUS:
Well, I hope you saved some room on there 'cause I just solved the case.

SHAWN claps.

UNCLE BURTON:
Yeah?

GUS:
A few months ago, Chef Antonio put beef broth in his veggie burgers at his restaurant, infuriating vegetarians all over Santa Barbara. That woman (points dramatically at DWYER) tried to put the chef out of business. But it didn't work. (walks over to DWYER) So instead, she poisoned the critic, and framed Chef Antonio for it.

DWYER:
What are you talking about? I never poisoned anybody. You guys are nuts.

UNCLE BURTON:
Hey, watch the way you talk to my nephew, 'cause he can see right into your soul.

GUS:
You were there on the night it happened, and I'm sure that seeing the chef behind bars must make you pretty happy.

DWYER:
Well, of course it makes me happy. He didn't have respect for the rights of animals. Meat is murder.

GUS:
But murder is also murder, Miss Dwyer!

JULIET arrives on the phone.

JULIET:
We'll be right there. (ends call) Guys, there's been a development in your case. Someone died from eating death caps that were discarded downtown yesterday.

SHAWN:
Yesterday?

UNCLE BURTON:
Yesterday?

SHAWN:
Dude, it couldn't be her. She's been chained to a pole for three days. Plus, we're nowhere near downtown.

GUS:
She still could've done it. She could have easily have slipped out of here and done it when no one was around.

JULIET:
Actually, she couldn't have. We have a rough description of the suspect that threw the mushrooms away. It was a six-foot tall man.

UNCLE BURTON:
(tears up postcard) Psychic. Bogus. (walks off)

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is sitting in front of VICK'S desk as GUS, LASSITER and JULIET stand behind him. SHAWN is holding VICK'S glass dolphin.

VICK:
Our second victim was a homeless man. Ate a bag of death caps he saw being tossed in a dumpster yesterday, then went to the health clinic today after complaining of abdominal pains. He died a few hours ago.

JULIET:
What else do we know about the person who discarded them?

VICK:
Not much. The victim died before he was able to give us an accurate description. And Chef Antonio was in custody, so it looks like he's innocent.

SHAWN looks up at GUS who avoids his gaze.

LASSITER:
Not if he had an accomplice. Now that we've got the chef, his partner's out there trying to dispose of evidence. (looks at JULIET) Let's go down to lockup, talk to that chef.

VICK:
Thanks.

JULIET leaves the office followed by LASSITER. The senior detective turns around.

LASSITER:
See you later.

LASSITER walks out backwards and SHAWN smiles.

GUS:
Where was the dumpster located?

VICK:
(pauses in making her phone call) At the corner of Laguna and Vista.

SHAWN stands and he and GUS walk for the exit. They stop in front of the closed door.

GUS:
Shawn, we were on the right track. Laguna and Vista is across the street from the newspaper. Whoever threw out those mushrooms works at the paper. We have to go back over there.

SHAWN:
(checks watch) Uncle Burton's flight leaves in an hour.

GUS:
I don't care. Do you know what's at stake here, Shawn? My entire future with my family.

SHAWN:
Yeah, that, two unsolved murders, and an innocent man who's still in jail. But your family too. Dude, we still have no idea who the killer is. And it's gonna take longer than an hour to figure that out.

UNCLE BURTON knocks on the glass and points at his watch.

GUS:
Fine, let's go to the stupid airport.

INT. ECHO, DAY

GUS is driving, UNCLE BURTON is in the passenger seat and SHAWN is in the back.

UNCLE BURTON:
(searching his bag) Listen, Burton, maybe you're not all to blame for fouling up this case. I mean, I can't help but think that you'd do better at this detective business if you didn't have Shawn weighing you down. I mean, I don't see what he's bringing to the operation. You're psychic, he's not. What do you need him around for?

SHAWN:
You know, Gus, your uncle has a point.

UNCLE BURTON:
What I'm trying to say is it was Murder, She Wrote, not Murder, They Wrote.

SHAWN:
That's true.

UNCLE BURTON:
Oh, this is great. I left some of my clothes at the hotel. Maybe if somebody hadn't rushed me down to the burger stand, I wouldn't have forgotten to pack my new yellow hippo shirt.

GUS:
You mean your hip shirts?

UNCLE BURTON:
No, I mean my hippo shirt. I bought a couple of 'em down on State Street. You know, normally I don't go for modern fashion, but these hippo shirts, they make my arms look so huge. They've got a nice little hippo logo right on the sleeve, see?

GUS:
Nice.

SHAWN sees the logo and remembers MOONEY'S description.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

EXT. MUSHROOM FARM, DAY

MOONEY:
He had sunshine coming out of his mouth, and he had a hippopotamus for a hand.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SHAWN realizes the "sunshine" is the cheese residue from Cheetos and that NICK also favored hippo shirts.

SHAWN:
(leans over GUS' left shoulder and whispers) Gus, I just figured it out. Who had the best access to the person picking the next restaurant critic? Think about it.

GUS:
Uncle Burton, you might be a little late for your flight.

GUS makes a U-turn.

INT. SANTA BARBARA MIRROR, NEWSROOM, DAY

PRITKIN is making an announcement.

PRITKIN:
So I'm proud to announce that our new restaurant critic will be... my hard-working assistant Nick. (shakes NICK'S hand)

Everyone in the office applauds except COOPER.

NICK:
Thank you so much, sir. I am so surprised. I honestly didn't expect to get this job at all.

GUS:
That's not exactly true, is it?! (walks forward)

SHAWN:
(tries to stop GUS) Whoa, Gus.

GUS:
Don't worry, I got it. (to NICK) You knew that Phil Pritikin would give you this job. That's why you murdered Vince Wagner.

SHAWN:
But, Gus, we...

GUS:
I said I got it.

JULIET and LASSITER enter the room.

JULIET:
Hang on, hang on. You're saying he's the killer?

GUS:
Yes. And I'm going to tell you exactly how he did it. In just a second. (pulls SHAWN aside) You never told me how he did it.

SHAWN:
Why do you think I'm trying to stop you?

GUS:
What are we gonna do? My uncle thinks I'm the psychic, the newspaper thinks you're a psychic, and the cops think I'm just translating your visions.

SHAWN:
Give me a second to think.

GUS:
Hurry up.

SHAWN:
Okay, I have a plan. Blurt out something nonsensical. Do it now.

They walk back to their "audience".

GUS:
Keylaces! Shoeboards! Pineapples!

SHAWN:
Oh, no. The visions have become too complex for one person to decipher. Gus, might I offer my help?

GUS:
Yes, Shawn, you may.

SHAWN:
(puts hand on GUS' head) Magic head.

GUS:
(puts a hand on SHAWN'S head, possibly pulling hair) Two heads working together as one.

They both grunt in pain as they apply pressure on each other.

SHAWN:
You! You wanted the most coveted job the paper had to offer, and you were in the good graces of the one guy that could give it to you, but there was a problem. Now, what was that problem? (smacks GUS on the back of the head)

GUS:
The problem was Wagner was never going to retire. So what did you do? (smacks SHAWN harder on the back of the head)

Everyone winces.

SHAWN:
You hatched a plan to force Wagner off the job. The first thing you needed was a fall guy. Unfortunately, Lee Majors wasn't available.

GUS whispers in SHAWN'S ear before crossing his arms.

SHAWN:
Apparently, he was available. He lives here in town. But he was a little out of your price range, so you flipped through Wagner's hate mail, and you discovered that Chef Antonio was the perfect candidate.

SHAWN smack GUS on the hand causing the other to moan.

GUS:
You knew Antonio's signature dish was his wild mushroom risotto, so what did you do? (gives SHAWN Indian burn)

SHAWN:
You tracked down some death cap mushrooms, and baked 'em into a risotto that resembled Antonio's. But you made two mistakes. First, you sliced your mushrooms into cubes instead of strips, and second... (stomps on GUS' foot)

GUS:
Wagner noticed that his risotto was cold. Why would risotto be served cold in a five-star restaurant? (pushes SHAWN at the back of his knee causing him to buckle)

SHAWN:
Because! Antonio didn't cook it. You snuck it in.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. ANTONIO'S, KITCHEN, DAY

ANTONIO:
We just had a surprise inspection a few days ago.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SHAWN:
A simple call to the county will confirm that there were no real health inspectors at Antonio's restaurant that night. You posed as one. And that gave you the cover you needed to switch out the risotto with your poisoned batch.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. ANTONIO'S, KITCHEN, DAY

We see NICK throw out ANTONIO'S risotto before taking a packaged risotto from his briefcase and place it on a plate.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GUS cries out as SHAWN rubs his head hard.

GUS:
Stop! Wagner died, Antonio was arrested, and no one suspected you were the real killer.

NICK:
This... This is preposterous! You can't just walk in here and accuse someone of being a murderer!

GUS:
Well, actually we can.

GUS makes a swing for SHAWN who ducks out of the way. When he stands, he holds his fist out for GUS. They bump.

SHAWN:
Damn right we can. They guy you went to about the mushrooms remembers exactly what you look like. After he toned down the drug-induced exaggerations.

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Tall guy! Orange cheese powder around the mouth, and a hippo logo on his sleeve.

NICK:
Al Mooney is insane! Nobody will believe what he says.

JULIET and LASSITER look at each other.

LASSITER:
Hang on a minute. I don't believe anyone said the witness' name. You're under arrest. Cuff him, guys.

The officers move forward.

SHAWN:
(does Robot) Busted.

OFFICER:
Hands behind your back, please.

NICK:
I want to talk to a lawyer.

OFFICER 2:
Yeah, sure, come on. Let's go.

The officers take NICK away. JULIET walks over to SHAWN and GUS.

JULIET:
Looks like you're finally able to communicate your visions again.

SHAWN:
It feels good to be back, Jules. Matter of fact, I'm having another vision right now. You and me, celebrating over dinner, drinks.

JULIET:
Hmm, sounds like you're still a little off. (walks away)

GUS:
Whew, another case solved.

UNCLE BURTON joins them.

UNCLE BURTON:
Yeah.

GUS:
Now, let just get you to the airport.

UNCLE BURTON:
For what? My flight left five minutes ago.

GUS:
Uh-oh. Are you mad?

UNCLE BURTON:
No. Why would I be mad at you, Gus, huh? (puts his arm around GUS' shoulder and affectionately rubs his head)

SHAWN smiles and mouths "Gus". JULIET comes over.

JULIET:
Guys, there's been a bank robbery downtown. Chief Vick's asking for you.

UNCLE BURTON:
A bank robbery. Man, that sounds exciting. You guys don't mind if I tag along, do you?

BOTH:
Well...

UNCLE BURTON:
Of course not. Wait for me. (goes with JULIET)

SHAWN:
Don't worry, I have a plan.

SHAWN and GUS follow UNCLE BURTON.

EXT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are saying goodbye to UNCLE BURTON before he gets into a taxi.

UNCLE BURTON:
Gus, take it easy. And, Shawn, don't forget to vacuum the office every night.

SHAWN:
I'm all over it, Uncle Burton. As a matter of fact, you might just want to check out this little ditty before you go. (gives UNCLE BURTON a clipboard folder)

GUS:
What's that?

SHAWN:
Well, Gus, I learned from your uncle that I need to be a better assistant. So I have taken the liberty to draw up a new employment contract that spells out the duties of the psychic detective's non-psychic associate.

UNCLE BURTON:
Assistant.

SHAWN:
(holds up hand in agreement) Assistant. Things like cleaning, emptying the trash, doing the dishes...

UNCLE BURTON gives the clipboard back to SHAWN who holds it open for GUS to sign.

GUS:
Thank you, Shawn. I'll sign it later.

UNCLE BURTON:
Nah, sign it now before he changes his mind.

SHAWN:
Yeah, Gus, before I change my mind.

GUS:
I'm not signing that, Shawn.

UNCLE BURTON:
And why the hell not?

GUS:
'Cause. Look, Uncle Burton, I gotta tell you something, and I know you're gonna be disappointed.

UNCLE BURTON:
I know, I know. You're confused because I'm here. You don't know whether to sign it "Burton" or "Gus". Let me tell you, son. Your psychic abilities help solve crimes, it makes the world a better place. Thanks to you, the Burton legacy will live on. So sign that thing any way you want to. You've got my blessing. (shakes GUS' hand) Is that what you were going to tell me?

GUS:
Pretty much.

UNCLE BURTON:
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Take it easy, fellas. We'll see ya.

UNCLE BURTON gets in the taxi and waves as it drives off.

SHAWN:
Well, there you have it. (opens clipboard) You can sign it any way you want.

GUS:
I'm not signing that, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Dude, you can sign anything you want. He said. (GUS hits him and walks away) You could sign it "Don Cheadle."

GUS:
I'm not signing.

GUS heads for the office.

SHAWN:
D'brickashaw Fillington. Delroy Lindo! (follows GUS)

Episode 2x07 If You're So Smart, Then Why Are You Dead?

1987

EXT. SPENCER HOUSE, YARD

HENRY is teaching SHAWN how to play chess. HENRY sips lemonade as SHAWN contemplates a move.

HENRY:
I'm still waiting, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Okay, I'm gonna take your pointy, sad-faced guy for my horsey guy.

HENRY:
(puts his hand over the piece to keep SHAWN from moving them) Stop, stop. What is this piece called? (points at a knight)

SHAWN:
I call him Dwight.

HENRY:
What is this one called? (points at a bishop)

SHAWN:
B.A. Baracus.

HENRY:
Look, Shawn, if you're gonna play this game, you're gonna have to learn what the pieces are called.

SHAWN:
What if I don't wanna play this game?

HENRY:
Chess is important. It's about strategy. It's about anticipating your opponent's next moves. This game is an allegory for life.

SHAWN:
Alle-what?

HENRY:
Look, when you're on the force, you're gonna have to take in huge amounts of information. Alibis, motives, witness statements. And trust me. If you wanna win, this is not stuff that you're gonna make up as you go. Do you understand? And I want you to focus (points at SHAWN'S eyes) and get serious(points at the board).

SHAWN:
Uh...

HENRY:
What? What are you trying to say?

SHAWN:
I can't remember what it's called.

HENRY:
What did I just...

SHAWN:
Never mind. I remember. Checkmate. (takes HENRY'S king) Bye, Dad. (leaves)

PRESENT DAY

EXT. CAF√â, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are sitting at a table with a young WOMAN. SHAWN is giving her a reading.

WOMAN:
Tell me. Is he cheating on me?

SHAWN:
Jury's still out. Do you have something that he's touched recently?

WOMAN:
Oh. (reaches into purse)I have the receipt from lunch. (gives SHAWN the receipt)

SHAWN looks at the receipt and sees the timestamp is 1:30 in the afternoon and that it was paid in cash.

SHAWN:
I'm sensing that he always takes you out for lunch. That he never pays with a credit card. Always cash.

WOMAN:
That's right.

SHAWN:
I'm also sensing that you can only call him at the office or on his cell phone. Never, ever at home?

WOMAN:
That's dead on. You must get goose bumps being around him.

GUS:
Oh, I get something.

SHAWN:
Daphne, I have good news and bad news. (sets the receipt on the table) The good news is he's not seeing someone else. The bad news... He's married.

WOMAN:
What? Are you sure?

SHAWN:
Just tell him a friend told you he was married and his face will tell you the rest. But... (reaches into GUS' inner jacket pocket) when the mourning period is over, this is my friend Gus's card. (pulls out card and gives it to her) He's a good listener, and he's willing to change everything about himself for a girl.

GUS:
Shawn, I do not...  (DAPHNE tries to give his card back) No, no. You keep that. Please.

EXT. WALK, DAY

GUS and SHAWN walk down the path that runs along the shore. SHAWN is carrying his leftovers in aluminum foil shaped into a swan.

GUS:
Shawn, we've reached a certain level of success. If you wanna keep doing these "Is my boyfriend cheating on me?" cases, you're gonna have to do them without me.

SHAWN:
Gus, you continue to underestimate me. I'll have you know that right now, as we speak, we're on our way to the office to meet with two gentlemen named Shockley and Goddard who have a very big case for us.

GUS:
So what are we talkin'? Robbery? Missing persons?

SHAWN:
They want us to look into the serious matter of... Well, that actually wasn't in the e-mail.

GUS:
So how do you know it was real?

SHAWN:
They used all caps, Gus. The meeting's at 2:00. We better hurry.

GUS:
(checks watch) It's 2:18.

SHAWN:
Well, somebody had to have the Belgian chocolate fondue, didn't they?

GUS:
That was you, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Well played, sir. (jogs ahead to the office)

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the office.

GUS:
(pushes ahead of SHAWN) Just let me do the talking. (buttons jacket) I don't want you to scare them off with your non sequitur ridiculousness.

They enter the inner office to see two teenage boys sitting on the chairs under the window. They are holding backpacks and wearing school uniforms.

SHAWN:
Please tell me you're not Mr. Shockley and Mr. Goddard.

The boys say nothing. GUS glares at SHAWN who just hangs his head.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS turn their backs on the boys and have a hushed conversation.

SHAWN:
Okay, before one of us goes all crazy and demands the other one apologize for taking a case from a couple grade schoolers, let's just hear them out. (they turn around) What can we do for you, gentlemen?

SHOCKLEY:
One of our teachers is a murderer.

SHAWN:
(whispers to GUS) Okay, I'm sorry. (to boys) Please, continue.

GODDARD:
He's killed before. And in two days, he's gonna kill again. And the cops don't listen to us 'cause we're kids.

GUS:
Okay, well, since we're here, and we don't have another meeting for (checks watch) a week, which one of your teachers is going to do this terrible thing?

GODDARD:
We don't know.

SHAWN:
Who's been murdered?

SHOCKLEY:
We don't know.

GUS:
Who's the next victim?

GODDARD:
We don't know.

GUS:
Perfect. I have no more questions. Shawn?

SHAWN:
I got nothing.

SHAWN and GUS move to their respective desks.

SHOCKLEY:
Can we just start from the top?

SHAWN:
Yes. That's a great idea. (sits and puts his feet on the desk)

GODDARD:
Well, Shock and I go to Meitner, and...

GUS:
The Meitner School for gifted students? (to SHAWN) These kids are geniuses.

GODDARD:
Technically, near genius.

GUS sits on the edge of his desk.

SHOCKLEY:
The school has some pretty cool stuff. So we broke in late at night...

SHAWN:
Say no more. Fight club?

GODDARD:
No. To hack into a space probe and see if we could get it to blink a word in old Morse code.

SHAWN:
Which word?

SHOCKLEY and GODDARD look at each other.

BOTH:
(laughing) Boobs.

GUS:
You went from all that trouble just to get some NASA techs to scratch their heads?

GODDARD:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Come on, Gus. That's kinda funny.

SHOCKLEY:
While reconfiguring the receiver, we accidentally tapped into a cell phone call being made from the Meitner campus. It was staticky, but we heard a deep, gravelly voice talking to their cousin. Someone named Muriel.

SHAWN:
And you want us to figure out why someone would name their kid Muriel?

SHOCKLEY:
(looks at GUS) The voice said something like, "I'm not gonna be pushed into a corner again."

SHAWN:
Are you sure it wasn't Dirty Dancing?

GODDARD:
And then we also heard verbatim "if I have to, I'll kill him. It won't be my first time. By Wednesday, he's a goner."

SHAWN:
"A goner"? It may have been James Cagney.

GUS:
Shawn, can I have a minute?

SHAWN and GUS meet in the middle of the room, facing away from the boys.

BOTH:
We're taking this case. You want to take this case?

SHAWN:
It's a chance to go undercover in high school a la 21 Jump Street. Obviously, I'm Johnny Depp. Sadly, you can only pass for Holly Robinson.

GUS:
Why can't I be Richard Grieco?

SHAWN:
Why would you want to be Richard Grieco? Isn't this the part where you say, "There ain't no case here, Shawn. Just a couple kids crying wolf."

GUS:
I don't sound like Richard Roundtree, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Why are you so eager?

GUS:
Same as you. I was a king in high school.

SHAWN:
Just because you carried a scepter doesn't make you a king.

GUS:
That's because I was in Macbeth.

Behind them, GODDARD looks at SHOCKLEY, who checks his watch.

SHAWN:
Dude, you played Banquo's kid.

SHOCKLEY:
Hey, you guys, can you help us?

SHAWN and GUS turn around.

SHAWN:
Is a lizard's skin dry and cracked?

GODDARD and SHOCKLEY confer in whispers.

GODDARD:
We believe that it is.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

JULIET is standing at the main desk but hurries after LASSITER as he walks past.

JULIET:
Guess what today is.

LASSITER:
(scoffs) It's not one of those touchy-feely holidays invented by card companies to goad me into buying a present for somebody I couldn't care less about, is it?

JULIET:
No. Today's our anniversary.

LASSITER:
Come again?

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER stops at his desk and JULIET stands in front of it.

JULIET:
It's been one year to the day that I came to Santa Barbara and we got partnered up.

LASSITER:
Oh. I didn't get you a present.

JULIET:
I don't want a present.

LASSITER:
That's what all women say. But believe me, deep down, you want a present. (sits) My soon-to-be ex-wife always hated what I gave her.

JULIET:
What did you give her?

LASSITER:
Cash, mostly.

JULIET:
Ugh. Anyway, this anniversary means that my one-year probation period is over. So what I want, that is, what would be good... What I'm trying to say is, I think I'm entitled to be primary on a case.

LASSITER:
How late are the shops open tonight?

JULIET:
Chief Vick says molding young officers is your duty and she's already approved this. Now give me a case.

LASSITER:
(sighs) Fine. (reaches over to inbox and picks up a clipboard) Let's see. (reads over list of cases) Homicide. That's a bit messy for your first time. Hi-tech burglary. You need a lot of forensics for that one. Bake sale slap fight. Seems easy, but believe me, I worked one once. Had to call in S.W.A.T.

JULIET:
Oh, come on. (leans against the desk)

LASSITER:
All right. Couple kids came in complaining about one of the teachers.

JULIET:
(crosses arms) Are you sure there's nothing of lower priority for me to handle?

LASSITER:
Lesson number one, O'Hara. There are no small cases, only small detectives. (holds out the folder)

JULIET:
(grabs folder)Let's roll.

JULIET walks away and LASSITER follows.

EXT. MEITNER SCHOOL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are walking along a sidewalk towards an entrance, students walking around them.

SHAWN:
Ah, high school. You know, I've always wanted to prove that one of our teachers was a monster. You remember our freshman music teacher, Mrs. Jorgenstorm? She was a nightbreed.

GUS:
She was not.

SHAWN:
She used to date Craig Shiffer.

GUS:
She did not.

SHAWN:
She wore a ton of make-up and lived in a cemetery.

GUS:
Next to a cemetery.

SHAWN:
So she claimed. If I remember correctly, you were always too afraid to follow her home.

SHOCKLEY and GODDARD meet them.

GODDARD:
So any leads yet?

SHAWN:
Hold it there, Doogie. First things first. Where do I get a juice box, and does it come in grape-a-licious?

SHOCKLEY:
Shouldn't you be doing psychic stuff? Someone could be killed in the next 48 hours. Possibly one of us.

SHAWN:
(chuckles) If you're so smart, why don't you solve the thing?

SHOCKLEY:
Midterms? Duh. I need to maintain my G.P.A. to keep my scholarship stipend.

SHAWN:
All right, all right, all right. Clearly, we have to get inside. What's our cover gonna be? Wait, I've got it. You're the preppy jerk who's dating the girl I'm in love with. I'm the lonely cafeteria guy who mows lawns and has a heart of gold.

GUS:
Let it go, Shawn. You can't pass for a teenager.

GODDARD:
Yeah, he's right. You got rhytids around the eyes.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) What did he just say to me?

SHOCKLEY:
Crow's feet. Do you squint or make funny faces a lot?

SHAWN makes a face of disgust as GUS chuckles.

SHAWN:
You guys are all nuts. If I grew my hair out, raised my voice an octave, I could...

GUS:
Stop, Shawn. I've already worked it out. We're documentarians working on a new film called Teeniuses: In the Mix.

SHAWN:
"Teeniuses"?

GUS:
Yes.

SHAWN:
Really, dude? You've got "Teeniuses" right on the tip of your tongue?

GUS:
In the Mix.

SHOCKLEY:
We already got your cover story. (holds out passes)

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, LIBRARY, DAY

The HEADMASTER is taking them on a tour of the school.

HEADMASTER:
Personally, I'm not sure that I see the merits of a class in paranormal studies, but we do let the students choose one guest instructor a semester. C. Everett Koop was crushed that he didn't get it.

SHAWN sees a group of students gathered at a table, studying quietly.

SHAWN:
What is this, like a study hall?

HEADMASTER:
Oh, no. Recess.

All the students turn pages at the same time.

SHAWN:
(sniffs) Does it smell like teen spirit in here?

SHAWN laughs and a boy walks by and shushes him. SHAWN makes a lunge for the boy but GUS pulls him back.

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, HALL, DAY

The HEADMASTER continues the tour. As they walk down the hall, SHAWN looks into one of the classrooms and sees a boy hooked up to a monitor receiving electric shocks. GUS walks ahead of SHAWN to the HEADMASTER.

GUS:
So tell me, Headmaster, can a former applicant request his or her file?

HEADMASTER:
Oh, no. Why?

GUS:
Oh, for the general public's general welfare. You know, generally.

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, ADMIN OFFICE, DAY

The HEADMASTER takes SHAWN and GUS into the office.

HEADMASTER:
Debbie will give you the forms you'll need to sign. (leaves)

SHAWN:
An application, Gus?

GUS:
Just curious.

SHAWN:
You applied to this school back in the day. Didn't you? And you didn't tell me about it.

GUS:
Who can remember that far back?

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that why you cried for a month when we were ten? Because they rejected you? Get down. (pulls GUS down so they are hidden by the counter)

JULIET and LASSITER enter from the hallway on the other side of the counter. JULIET stands at the back of the line of students while LASSITER goes to the front. He turns around to talk to her but she's not there. He pushes a male student out of the way.

LASSITER:
Excuse me. O'Hara? (motions for JULIET to come up front) Lesson number two. Cops don't wait in line. They go straight to the front. Even at Starbucks.

JULIET:
Hi, SPBD. (holds up badge) Can I please get the class schedules for these students? Thank you.

JULIET hands the clerk the list and he goes to get the schedules.

LASSITER:
Lesson number three. Don't say "Please", don't say "Thank you," and definitely don't say "Hi." Spirit Squad auditions were over ten years ago. You're an authority figure. Act like it.

As LASSITER talks, SHAWN and GUS scoot along the floor behind the counter.

JULIET:
Ever heard "You catch more flies with honey"?

LASSITER:
Lesson number four. Don't quote cornpone country bumpkin sayings to your commanding officer.

JULIET:
How many lessons are there?

LASSITER:
638.

SHAWN and GUS pop up on the other side of the counter.

SHAWN:
Welcome to the Meitner School for Gifted Children. How may we... (gasps) It's a miracle!

GUS:
Thank God, you're all right.

SHAWN:
We heard a cop named Lassie died. Jules, tell me you got the flowers.

LASSITER:
Lassie III was a retired police dog.

GUS:
Oh. From the obit, it's amazing what you two had in common. Strong, dedicated, loyal.

SHAWN:
Bouts with ringworm. Expressive eyes. Goes like this after he poops. (wipes his feet on the floor)

GUS:
Shawn.

JULIET:
Seriously, are you guys working my case?

SHAWN:
Case? What case? No, no, no, no. They've been after me for a while to teach a class.

LASSITER:
What do we say?

JULIET:
Hmm? Oh, right. (tough voice) Stay out of our way and don't get involved, Spencer.

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, CENTER HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the large central hall.

GUS:
This place is overwhelming. Where do we even start?

SHAWN:
Easy. Who were the eyes and ears of Dufman Elementary?

GUS:
Mr. Graves, the custodian. We had a special bond.

SHAWN points to the CUSTODIAN mopping the floor.

GUS:
Huh. Custodians have access to the building at night. He could be our bad guy.

SHAWN:
If he has a deep and gravelly voice, he's el suspecto primero.

SHAWN and GUS walk up behind the CUSTODIAN.

SHAWN:
Yo! How you doing?

The CUSTODIAN grunts and straightens up.

CUSTODIAN:
(high voice) I'm mopping up vomit. How do you think I'm doing? By the way, those mats in front of the doors are to rub your shoes on. Thanks for the extra work.

SHAWN:
Whoops. Sorry about that. Uh, I'm Shawn Spencer, psychic lecturer. And I sense that something is amiss in your universe.

CUSTODIAN:
(stretches) Yeah, my lumbago's flaring up.

SHAWN:
Nope, not that. Something a little more out of the ordinary. Something? Anything?

CUSTODIAN:
Can't you just tell me what you're looking for?

GUS:
Did something happen here on Friday night?

CUSTODIAN:
(nervously taps mop handle) Oh. Um... Nope. Nothing springs to mind.

SHAWN:
I can sense you're lying. The spirits tell me that your little pants are on fire.

CUSTODIAN:
Fine. I found this weird gold pin when I had to work late Friday night. When I mopped this area, no pin. But when I circled back to wax, there it was.

GUS:
So you're saying it got here in the middle of the night?

CUSTODIAN:
Who do I look like? Jake and the Fatman? All I know is that after two weeks in the lost and found, it's mine. Legit.

SHAWN:
Where is this lost and found?

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, LOUNGE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS each look through a bin of lost items.

SHAWN:
Who loses a microscope and doesn't come looking for it?

GUS:
Ear infection medicines. Inhalers.

SHAWN:
And what appears to be 168 pairs of hideous eyeglasses. (spots the pin and picks it up) "SXY". (shows GUS) Apparently, our perp is so sexy, he felt the need to die cast it onto steel and wear it on his lapel.

GUS:
That's not an S. That's the integral sign in calculus for the area under the curve XY. Whoever was skulking around here after hours must be a math teacher.

SHAWN:
How many math teachers work here? Four or five tops?

GUS:
18.

SHAWN:
Hmm. It's all right. I have a plan. (stands and gives GUS the bin to put away) It's a scary one. We'll have to rely on all our animal instincts. We are going to the teachers' lounge.

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, TEACHERS' LOUNGE, DAY

The teachers in the lounge are having coffee, reading newspapers or talking with co-workers.

GUS:
(whispers) Try to blend in. Act natural.

SHAWN:
(clears throat) How 'bout these kids today, huh? Oh, my God! Look at this selection of donuts. (holds up nearly empty box) This is pathetic. Who left a tenth? (holds up bit of donut) I wanna know how that makes sense. You...

GUS:
(nudges SHAWN) Shawn. Focus. Math teacher.

SHAWN:
(puts down box) There's no math teachers here.

GUS:
How do you know?

SHAWN:
(sees man with imprint lines on his face) That guy's been wearing goggles. He's clearly a chem lab teacher. (a woman has a red mark on her chin) Violin hickey. Music teacher. (a man in a track suits sits on a couch) However, a gym teacher could be more our speed.

They walk over to the couch and SHAWN sits next to the teacher and puts his legs up on the table. GUS slides on the coffee table, meaning to stop in front of the teacher, but overshoots and lands on the floor. He quickly picks himself up and sits on the table.

GUS:
Hey, buddy. Uh, we're new here and we were told to see a math teacher specializing in calculus.

TEACHER:
Professor Hahn. Handles all remedial math.

SHAWN:
That qualifies as remedial. What's calculus? The one with the blocks and the shapes?

GUS:
Do you know where we can find him?

TEACHER:
You can catch him at the end of the day. He's in my carpool.

SHAWN:
Sweet! Gus, this school has a carpool.

GUS:
Answer to our prayers.

TEACHER:
Why?

SHAWN:
Gus managed to get his car impounded. He parked on a statue.

GUS:
I'm contesting the ticket.

SHAWN:
Here's the thing. We had to take the bus to school today. I accidentally gave myself a wedgie. Gus had to sit next to the girl who peed.

TEACHER:
Why are you telling me all of this?

SHAWN:
I thought it seemed obvious. Can we get a lift home?

INT. CAR, DAY

The Gym TEACHER is driving and GUS is riding shotgun. SHAWN is in the back seat stuck between a snoring teacher on his left and HAHN on his right.

GUS:
So must be fun being a gym teacher. You get to play sports all day.

TEACHER:
I teach gym at a school full of prodigy nerds. I start off my day by getting 300 notes excusing kids from gym class because of rickets or IBS. I tossed a ball at a student once. He wet his pants. And his parents filed a civil suit against me.

SHAWN:
Professor Hahn. Hahn! Math teacher, right?

HAHN:
Yes. Are you the new psychic lecturer?

SHAWN:
(sees a hole in HAHN'S lapel) That I am. I'm getting a feeling about you. Are you a Right Said Fred fan? Are you too sexy for your shirt?

HAHN:
Excuse me?

SHAWN:
I'm sensing you're so sexy it hurts. (holds up pin) Boop.

HAHN:
Oh. How'd you find that? (takes the pin and puts it back on)(to TEACHER) Hey, moron. Right up here.

SHAWN:
I'm sensing Riley may have forgotten because you didn't use the carpool last Friday.

RILEY makes the turn.

HAHN:
Wow, that's right. I stayed late. Okay, right here. Stop right here.

RILEY stops the car and HAHN gets out. SHAWN leans forward between the open door and the car and GUS leans out his window.

GUS:
Deep voice. Missed the carpool on Friday.

SHAWN:
Sounds like our guy. Now we've just gotta figure out why and how he's gonna kill somebody.

HAHN knocks on RILEY'S window and the driver lowers it.

HAHN:
And one more thing. If you are late picking me up in the morning, I will tear your head off.

SHAWN:
Maybe just the how.

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, CENTER HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are crossing the hall to a set of stairs.

GUS:
Are you prepared for your psychic seminar?

SHAWN:
Gus, please.

SHOCKLEY and GODDARD cross the hall and join them.

GODDARD:
Any leads? I'm adapting this into a Nancy Drew fanfic.

SHAWN:
I believe whoever's involved is in the vicinity.

SHOCKLEY:
(hands SHAWN index cards) We made notes for you. Bullet points you might wanna try to hit. Don't show any fear.

SHAWN gives the cards to GUS without even looking at them.

GODDARD:
Don't split any infinitives.

SHOCKLEY:
Don't dangle your participles.

GUS:
(reads cards) At least not in public.

SHAWN:
Look, if I understood what you guys were saying, I'd still be a virgin. Now, run along. Go to class.

SHOCKLEY and GODDARD leave.

GUS:
Really? (throws away cards)

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, LECTURE HALL, DAY

SHAWN writes on the chalkboard as GUS moves the podium forward. HAHN walks into the room along with the students and stands in the back. GUS turns around and stands next to SHAWN at the board.

GUS:
(whispers) Hahn is here.

SHAWN:
(whispers) The seminar's open to both students and teachers, Gus. I personally extended Hahn an invitation so I can grill him in front of a live studio audience. If he's killed before, I'll get him to confess.

GUS:
(whispers) How're you gonna interrogate someone and teach a class at the same time?

SHAWN:
First the carrot, then the stick. (turns around to face students)

GUS:
You don't even know what that means, do you?

SHAWN:
Leave me alone.

GUS sits at the desk off to the side.

SHAWN:
"Phsysics." (underlines the word on the board) The physics of psychics. I'm Professor Shawn Spencer. I will be your psychic ferryman over the River Styx. That's Gus. My ferry.

GUS:
(stands and waves) Hello.

SHAWN:
Each one of us is born with a kernel of what I like to dub "paranormalevolance". I, however, was born with an extra normal amount. Two cobs to be exact. Allow me to demonstrate. (sees one of the boys rubbing his thumb across his teeth) Congratulations on getting your braces removed.

STUDENT 1:
That doesn't mean you're psychic. Maybe you're just hyper-observant.

SHAWN sees flakes on the student's glasses and red shirt.

SHAWN:
You wear that white sweatshirt every day. Shall I tell the class why?

The student just lowers his head.

SHAWN:
You.

SHAWN looks at the same student LASSITER pushed out of the way in the office. He sees a patch of dry skin along the hairline.

SHAWN:
You, young man. A little aloe will do wonders for that combination skin.

SHAWN then notices a little skin irritation on the student's chin.

SHAWN:
And perhaps you should use more care while shaving, or, just wait until you can grow facial hair altogether.

STUDENT 2:
You could've just smelled my aftershave on the way in. How 'bout a real test? I'll write the answer on the board.

SHAWN:
And I'll tell you the question. Have at it, young Trebek. (to GUS) Trebek, I said.

GUS:
This is Jeopardy!

The student comes down and writes an equation on the board.

SHAWN:
Potent potables!

GUS:
Questions that start with P!

SHAWN:
The smartass who thinks he's gonna make me look silly.

GUS:
Who is this guy?

SHAWN chuckles as he and GUS turn around to see the equation on the board. SHAWN looks at GUS for the answer but GUS subtly shakes his head. SHAWN walks over and puts his hand over the student's face.

SHAWN:
Your negativity is really impeding my psychic ability.

STUDENT 2:
Or you're just a big fraud.

SHAWN:
(points) Go to the principal's office.

STUDENT 2:
Wait a second.

SHAWN:
Get out of here. Go. Go. Go, get out of here. Get out of here.

STUDENT 2 leaves.

SHAWN:
None of you should be friends with him.

GUS:
(behind his hand) Psst. Hahn.

SHAWN:
Professor Hahn. I'm getting something from you. A kind of darkness. Yes. I see you clearly. With a target.

HAHN:
I shop at Target.

SHAWN:
Sure, but, but, I... I see you on a cell phone with your cousin. Plotting, planning. Something secret.

HAHN:
Yes. Yes, I've been planning a surprise party for my sister-in-law. She's impossible to surprise. That's amazing.

SHAWN looks over at GUS.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER is sitting on the edge of his desk as he talks on the phone. JULIET stands behind him, tapping her nails on the wall in irritation.

LASSITER:
Yeah, well, if she's gonna have puppies, she's gonna have puppies. There's nothing we can do about it. Look, if you had her fixed like I... (puts the phone to his chest and turns to face JULIET) Do you need something?

JULIET:
Yes, actually.

LASSITER:
Well?

JULIET:
Well, what?

LASSITER:
Well, order me off the phone. You need me to work, and I'm wasting time.

JULIET puts her finger down on the receiver, disconnecting the call.

LASSITER:
That's a nice touch. (sits in chair)

JULIET:
I've been reviewing the statement we took from the kids on campus. They said whoever this teacher is, he's already killed once, and he's going to kill again.

LASSITER:
Right.

JULIET:
Right. It strikes me that it's difficult to solve a crime that hasn't happened yet. So why don't we focus our attention on the murder that already has?

LASSITER:
Makes sense.

JULIET:
Great. (brings over a wheeled file basket) These are the case files for every unsolved homicide in the Santa Barbara area over the last five years.

LASSITER:
Lot of paper cuts there. Have fun. (turns to desk)

JULIET:
No. (pushes the cart towards LASSITER) I need you to review these and tell me if there are any connections with the Meitner faculty.

LASSITER:
Yeah. I'm not gonna do that. (pushes cart back at JULIET)

JULIET:
You delegate this background stuff all the time. To me, usually, almost always when I have dinner plans. (pushes cart at LASSITER) Now, go through these with a fine-tooth comb and tell me what you find. (soft voice) If it's not too much trouble.

LASSITER:
(stands) O'Hara, you are drunk with power.

JULIET:
I know! Isn't it great? (smiles and walks away)

LASSITER gives a slight smile and sits back down at his desk.

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, LECTURE HALL, DAY

SHAWN continues his class.

SHAWN:
And that amazing demonstration is phsysics at work. It's like thinking of a song, and then, bam! It's the next tune on the radio. Or... Or that moment when you know it's right to kiss a girl. That's when you have used the power.

GUS clears his throat.

SHAWN:
Professor Hahn! I'm still sensing something from...

STUDENT 1:
Um, professor?

SHAWN:
Call me sensei.

STUDENT 1:
How can we harness...

SHAWN:
Ah, ah, ah. Sensei.

STUDENT 1:
Sensei?

SHAWN:
Yes?

STUDENT 1:
How can we harness this power to help us, um, kiss girls?

GUS:
I'll take it from here, Shawn. (stands and walks to the podium)

SHAWN:
Oh, I don't know, Gus. Now may not be the time to impede their psycho-sexual development.

GUS:
(stands next to SHAWN) Well, maybe you've forgotten that I was the one who took the hottest girl in school to the prom.

SHAWN:
That's because I told her you were dying. Otherwise, I would have had to pay for the limo myself and...

GUS:
Let me take this, please.

SHAWN:
Gus, my ferry. (walks over to desk and leans against it)

GUS:
Thank you, Shawn. Now, kissing someone for the first time can be tricky business. I like to employ the Kadeem Hardison method. When you're on a date...

The students raise their hands.

SHAWN:
Uh, uh, I can sense a question forming in all of your minds. If it's "Who is Kadeem Hardison?" or "How do we ask someone on a date?" put 'em down.

The students lower their hands.

GUS:
Listen, it's not your fault. You're all a bunch of dudes.

Three students to GUS' left raise their hands. They have very short haircuts.

STUDENT 3:
Um, we're girls.

SHAWN:
(mumbles) That's awkward.

The bell rings.

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, CENTER HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk down the stairs.

SHAWN:
I'll cover all the dating stuff in my next seminar. "Puberty : Monster or misunderstood friend?" (sniffs hand) That kid I sent to the office had some weird zit cream on.

GUS sees a professor talking with a student and greets him like an old friend.

GUS:
Professor Enrico! (walks over, arms open, laughing, and hugs ENRICO) Guster. Burton Guster. You interviewed me for admission? Math prodigy?

ENRICO:
I interview people all the time. Was this recently?

GUS:
Semi-recent. 20 years ago. But I tap-danced in trochaic tetrameter. (dances a little) Made you wanna cry.

ENRICO:
That rings a bell. So, visiting the old alma mater?

GUS:
No. I went to public school.

ENRICO:
Really? Could've sworn I recommended admission. Either way, I assume a person with your skills ended up at JPL or some kind of think tank?

GUS:
Actually, I ended up in pharmaceuticals. You know, curing stuff.

ENRICO:
Well, keep up the good work. (leaves)

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
(walks over) Dude, you didn't even mention Magic Head.

SHOCKLEY and GODDARD come running over.

SHOCKLEY:
Guys, we're freaking out.

SHAWN:
We're pretty sure Professor Hahn is our guy.

GODDARD:
So turn him in to the cops.

GUS:
Not without proof. Know anything about him?

SHOCKLEY:
The only time we see him is when he gets his espresso in the morning before homeroom.

GUS:
There's an espresso bar here on campus?

GODDARD:
Wait! Wasn't Hahn involved in that thing? You remember that thing?

SHOCKLEY:
The thing with the other thing?

GODDARD:
No, no. Just the first thing from five years ago? When the student attacked the professor?

SHOCKLEY:
Oh, yeah, that could've been Hahn.

SHAWN snaps his fingers in front of the students to get their attention.

GODDARD:
Some student attacked Hahn and he made sure the Headmaster expelled him.

SHAWN:
Who's the student that attacked him?

SHOCKLEY and GODDARD shrug.

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, BASEMENT, DAY

SHAWN and GUS go down the stairs to a room filled with file cabinets containing student records - and applications.

SHAWN:
According to the school computers, the only kid to be expelled in the last ten years was a Lester Baekeland.

SHAWN stops at one bank of cabinets while GUS walks over to another section. SHAWN opens one of the files and coughs from the dust. GUS opens a drawer quietly.

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
(coughs) Getting the plague, apparently. God! (goes through files) Babcock, Babette, Battra-something... Baekeland. God! (takes out file and coughs at more dust) I can see why you wanted to go here, Gus. They keep meticulous records of everything just like you.

GUS has found the file he was looking for and is reading it.

GUS:
Uh-huh.

SHAWN:
Expelled for cheating. Dude, there's a transcript of his hearing.

GUS:
What does it say?

SHAWN:
The kid claimed Hahn busted him for cheating and tried to extort his scholarship money from him to stay quiet. Hahn denies it. The headmaster, of course, sides with the teacher. The kid gets expelled. Huh. That means Hahn is a blackmailer. (closes file) Maybe he threatened the wrong person this time. (closes file drawer and looks for GUS) Gus? Gus?

GUS is sitting on the floor against one of the cabinets, a file open in his hands.

GUS:
I got in. I applied, and I got in.

SHAWN:
That means a lot, buddy. You'd rather stay with your best friend than, you know, have a future.

GUS:
No, Shawn. It says, "Parents of applicant refused admission." If I'd known I'd gotten in, I would've been ghost. This

place has a direct line to the Ivy League. Why would my parents turn it down?

SHAWN:
I don't know. Maybe it was just too expensive.

GUS:
I could've gotten financial aid, Shawn. Half the kids here are on scholarships with stipends.

SHAWN:
Can we not obsess about this right now? We do have a murder to prevent.

GUS:
I'm not obsessing, Shawn. I just found out that the course of my life may have been changed by my parents. You've seen Sliding Doors.

SHAWN:
(walks away) I most certainly have not.

GUS:
(follows) Yes, you did!

SHAWN:
Dude, I have not seen Sliding Doors. (goes up stairs)

GUS:
It was me, you, and Missy Isaacs. What are you talking about? (follows)

SHAWN:
I'm talking about a Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle that I know I never saw! (shuts off lights and opens door)

GUS:
Oh, please! (follows SHAWN from the room and closes the door)

INT. ECHO, DAY

GUS is driving as he calls and leaves a message for his parents.

GUS:
I know you're home. This is my fifth message. Call me back. (ends call) They're just screening my calls until I've let this go. But it's not gonna happen.

SHAWN:
Gus, let's face it. Your parents thought splitting us up at a young age was a mistake. And I can't say I blame them. For a while, I was your only friend that wasn't imaginary or an action figure of some kind.

GUS:
Shawn, if anything, my parents wanted me to stay in public school so that I would stand out compared to people like you.

SHAWN:
Yeah. No holes in that theory.

GUS:
I don't know which is worse, my parents dodging my calls, or you volunteering me to pick up a murderer first thing in the morning.

SHAWN:
Dude, it is your turn to drive the carpool.

GUS:
What's our plan? Today is Murder Day.

SHAWN:
Speaking of Murder Day, is that really what you're wearing?

GUS:
(glares at SHAWN) Shawn, in about two minutes, we're gonna be in a confined space with a killer. Please tell me you have a good reason.

SHAWN:
Of course I have a good reason, Gus. This time, it'll be just you, me, and him, and I will totally break him down.

They pull up in front of a house in front of which are fire engines. The other side of the street is lined with cars and gawping onlookers.

GUS:
That's Hahn's house.

SHAWN and GUS look at the house to see a burned-out shell. Two men from the coroner's office push a gurney, on which is a full body bag, towards the van.

SHAWN:
Or maybe it'll just be you and me.

INT. HAHN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are inside the house with LASSITER and JULIET.

LASSITER:
Well, according to our arson investigator, here is our murderer. (holds up remains of coffee maker) Apparently, there was a slight gas leak in the stove. Overnight, the room fills with natural gas, the coffee pot clicks on in the morning, there's a spark, and kaboom.

SHAWN:
No. I'm sensing it was definitely more of a kablam.

A small piece from the ceiling falls, hitting the coffeepot on its way to the floor. LASSITER looks up.

JULIET:
So you're saying this was an accident?

LASSITER:
Arson investigator says there's no sign of foul play.

SHAWN remembers what SHOCKLEY had said the day before.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, CENTER HALL, DAY

SHOCKLEY:
The only time we see him is when he gets his espresso in the morning before homeroom.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. HAHN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN:
Wait, I'm having a vision. Hahn preferred Italian coffee. Espresso.

GUS:
Why would he be brewing coffee here if he was gonna get his fix in the morning at school?

SHAWN:
I'm sensing our killer brought the coffee machine here and used it as a detonator after creating the gas leak.

LASSITER:
What killer, Spencer? Our expert says it's an accident.

SHAWN:
I say murder. It's what drew me to this wretched place. Talk to the girl who makes the espresso. I usually don't do this, but I have a strong sense she'll back this up. Hahn had a cup first thing every morning. What do you call those coffee people? They're not cashiers, they're not waitresses.

GUS:
Barista.

SHAWN:
Gus, if you don't know the answer, don't make up words.

LASSITER and JULIET turn away. Out in the hall, SHAWN sees another detective hand over an evidence bag with a foreclosure notice sealed inside. The date of the payment is August 15, 2007.

SHAWN:
(whispers to GUS) Dude, Hahn was broke. No wonder he's a blackmailer. The due date for the payment is the same as murder day. Coincidence?

GUS:
I think not.

SHAWN sees the remains of a burnt file, part of the label missing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHOCKLEY:
It was staticky, but we heard a deep, gravelly voice talking to their cousin. Someone named Muriel.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. HAHN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN fills in the rest of the label: Muriel Juvenile Hall - 1991.

SHAWN:
We are so on this case now.

SHAWN and GUS leave.

LASSITER:
It's your call, O'Hara. Either it's an accident and we're done, or it's a homicide, and there's a killer on the loose.

JULIET:
I don't buy this accident angle for a second. Those kids practically said this would happen. Let's bring them back in for questioning.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM A, DAY

JULIET slams a blank legal pad on the table and takes on an intimidating persona for her questioning.

JULIET:
If you confess now, (pushes the pad forward) name your accomplices, I will let the D.A. know that you cooperated and maybe, just maybe, no guarantees, just maybe, they'll cut you a break. (looks around and pushes over a chair before brushing her hair out of her eyes)

LASSITER is sitting across the table from her, unimpressed.

LASSITER:
It's terrible.

JULIET:
What?

LASSITER:
Am I scared? Am I quaking? No, that was what I call lowercase mad. You need to be uppercase mad!

The door opens and BUZZ sticks his head in.

BUZZ:
Those strange kids are in interrogation B.

JULIET nods and BUZZ closes the door. She heads of the door.

LASSITER:
Listen, O'Hara. (stands) Given your slightly, pedestrian performance and the fact that this has now jumped to a straight-up homicide, maybe I should take over as lead.

JULIET:
But, why? It's my case.

LASSITER:
Which was fine when it was just kids telling tales, but there are certain nuances involved in a murder investigation which require a more experienced touch.

JULIET:
Nuances the Chief says I'll learn by being primary.

LASSITER:
Yeah, but...

JULIET:
But what?

LASSITER:
There was an explosion. I've never had a case with an explosion before. I've had assault and burglary cases. Once I even had a murder by thermometer. But I never had an explosion. Come on, haven't you ever pictured yourself trying to out run a fireball down a dark tunnel?

JULIET:
No.

JULIET leaves, and, after a slight pause, LASSITER follows.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM B, DAY

JULIET and LASSITER enter the room. SHOCKLEY and GODDARD are sitting at the table, their backs to the mirror. JULIET walks around to face the students while LASSITER stays at the end of the table by the door.

JULIET:
Obviously, due to recent events, we are taking a closer look at everything surrounding the school, including the statement you gave to us.

SHOCKLEY:
You mean when we predicted someone was going to die today and they did?

JULIET:
Well, that, and...

LASSITER:
Watch your mouth, kid. Okay, you're not fooling anybody. We know what's going on here.

JULIET:
What he means is please tell us again about the phone call you overheard.

LASSITER:
No. (leans aggressively on the table) Tell us about your relationship with Hahn! You little son of a...

JULIET:
Lassiter, stop! They're teenagers. (to students) We're sorry.

LASSITER:
(whispers to JULIET) Lesson 63. Do not apologize to the perp.

JULIET:
(whispers to LASSITER) They're not perps.

LASSITER:
(to JULIET) You don't know that!

GODDARD:
You two aren't really acquainted with game theory or prisoner's dilemma, are you?

LASSITER and JULIET turn their heads towards the boys.

LASSITER:
Huh?

SHOCKLEY:
He means you two don't really get the good cop bad cop dyad.

GODDARD:
Are you guys, like, together?

SHOCKLEY:
No, she's way out of his league.

GODDARD:
But no ring. Given his age, I'm guessing divorced?

LASSITER:
I... Wha... Sorry. What?

SHOCKLEY:
Still can't talk about it. So it's relatively recent then? I'm getting separated. Not divorced.

GODDARD:
Did you ever just listen to her problems, rather than always trying to solve them?

SHOCKLEY:
No, you had to be the big tough cop, didn't you? You never let her inside.

BUZZ enters the room with a cup of coffee. LASSITER presses him against the wall with one arm and grips him by the collar.

LASSITER:
See this, Brainiac? This is what's waiting for you when you turn 18. You're gonna graduate, and get your diploma, and then, bam! We're taking a trip down to the docks.

GODDARD:
That doesn't look very intimidating with, uh, you know, the one arm.

LASSITER releases BUZZ, inhales deeply, takes the coffee and leaves.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

GODDARD and SHOCKLEY are working on HENRY'S old computer. HENRY comes down the stairs and looks at the boys who don't even notice him. He walks over to SHAWN and GUS who are making sandwiches.

HENRY:
When did my house become a daycare center?

SHAWN:
Dad, you've been bugging me for months to fix your computer. (picks up sandwich) I finally bring the geek squad in to do it, and now you're gonna give me a hard time?

HENRY walks past SHAWN and grabs the sandwich just as SHAWN is about to take a bite.

HENRY:
Thank you! (leaves)

GUS:
Hahn had someone's juvenile record. Maybe he dug up something on our killer's past, which means we have to hack into the juvie database.

SHAWN:
Yeah, I'm with you, except for the part about coming to my dad's house. (heads to fridge)

GUS:
Well, according to the kids, the hacking may come back to us. Now the authorities will be led to an antique computer purchased by a former cop. Can you say wild goose chase?

GODDARD:
Jeez, this computer is ancient. I didn't realize ColecoVision was still in business. All right, I'm in. (SHAWN and GUS join them) Muriel Juvenile Hall/Halfway House. What am I looking for?

SHAWN:
I'm sensing our investigation centers on the year 1991.

GODDARD:
'91? There's nothing but a bunch of photos here.

SHAWN:
Click on the top right. (leans in)

GODDARD clicks on a photo making it larger. SHAWN recognizes one of the men in the photo as a student.

SHAWN:
That's that kid I sent to the principal's office.

SHOCKLEY:
Kirk G√∂del.

GUS:
Why the hell is a photo from today mixed in with photos from '91?

GODDARD:
It's not. This photo was taken 15 years ago.

GUS and SHAWN look at each other.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN is having a "vision" for JULIET.

SHAWN:
I'm having a vision. The Man from Snowy River.Eddie Macon's Run? (resigned) Spartacus.

JULIET:
Kirk Douglas!

SHAWN:
Yes. See if there's a student named Kirk.

JULIET:
(goes to desk) The registrar gave me access to all their files. (sits)

SHAWN:
(sighs) It's perfectly normal, you know.

JULIET:
What is? (types on computer)

SHAWN:
The anxiety of being in charge. I can sense you have the weight of the world on your shoulders.

JULIET:
I just really wanna get this right. Oh. I've got something.

SHAWN moves around the desk and stands next to JULIET to look at the screen.

JULIET:
Kirk G√∂del.

SHAWN:
G√∂del. It's almost pronounced like girdle because of the omelet on the "O."

JULIET:
Pretty sure that's an umlaut.

SHAWN:
I've heard it both ways.

JULIET:
Let's see. No juvenile record, only child. All stats match up with his school records. Nothing out of the ordinary. Let's see what Google says.

SHAWN:
Uh, search it with the word Muriel.

JULIET types in the search.

JULIET:
Oh, here's an article from the Muriel County Newsletter. According to this article, Kirk G√∂del and his parents died five years ago in a car crash. There should be a death certificate on file, but there's no sign of it.

SHAWN:
What the hell is going on?

SHAWN remembers what he noticed about KIRK during the lecture.

FLASHBACK

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, LECTURE HALL, DAY

SHAWN:
You, young man. A little aloe will do wonders for that combination skin.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN:
Circle your horses, Jules. We're about to crack your case like an egg. (starts to leave and stops in front of her desk) And then, we'll make some umlauts with shallots. And justice.

JULIET stands, grabs the file and follows after SHAWN.

INT. MEITNER SCHOOL, LECTURE HALL, DAY

SHAWN is standing at the podium and GUS sits on the desk to the side. The bell rings.

SHAWN:
Please take your seats. Good, I'm glad you're all on time for Phsysics 2: The Wrath of Khan. (walks in front of the podium) Today's lecture will cover comeuppance and how to solve a crime in a crowded room. Someone here is living a lie. Someone in this room is a ghost-faced killer.

The students look at each other. SHAWN slams his hand down on the desk of the student in front of him and leans into the boy's face.

SHAWN:
It's not you. But you have to do something about the hair immediately. Okay? I'd start now. (stands and points to the next student) You. Your heart is pure. I'd say lose the earring, (looks at GUS) but I actually think he pulls it off.

GUS shrugs.

SHAWN:
(points at KIRK) But you. Y...

KIRK stands and runs out the door.

SHAWN:
Why do they always run? Don't they know it makes them look guilty?

The door is opened by JULIET and LASSITER has KIRK by the collar as he shoves him inside.

LASSITER:
You need this guy?

SHAWN:
Thank you, Detective Lassiter.

LASSITER:
Have a seat. (pushes KIRK into an empty desk) You mind telling us what we're doing here?

SHAWN:
Well, as the beautiful, industrious, Detective O'Hara has already gathered...

JULIET:
(bends over) You're not the real Kirk G√∂del, are you?

SHAWN:
Will the real Kirk G√∂del please stand up?

JULIET:
I don't think that's gonna happen. You stole the real Kirk G√∂del's identity so that you could get into this school.

SHAWN:
(gasps) But there's more to this case than stolen identity. (slowly walks up the steps to stand by the desk) I'm sensing a much darker, diabolical past. Yes. You did a stint in juvie for causing someone's death. 15 years ago.

LASSITER:
What, are you, nuts? He's a kid.

SHAWN:
True. So how could this be possible, class?

SHOCKLEY:
Time travel. He cryogenically froze himself in order to travel to the future.

SHAWN:
No.

GODDARD:
He's a clone of the original.

SHAWN:
You know what? Just never mind, guys. Save it for your online role playing.

SHAWN reaches into LASSITER'S inside jacket pocket and pulls out and handkerchief. He holds it up for everyone to see before using it to wipe KIRK'S face. He then puts his arm over his shoulder to show LASSITER. LASSITER takes it from SHAWN and stares at it.

LASSITER:
He's wearing make-up.

SHOCKLEY:
Is he gay?

SHAWN:
No. Well, maybe. Look, I don't... I don't know. But the reason he's wearing make-up is because he is actually 30, trying to pass for a teenager.

JULIET:
30? What kind of moisturizer do you use?

SHAWN:
Class, I would advise you take notes. There will be a test on this.

The students open their notebooks and SHAWN bends over to be face-to-face with KIRK, pointing a finger at him. His reveal is intercut with flashbacks to the action he is detailing.

SHAWN:
You were always the smartest kid in your class, but with juvie on your record, you couldn't get into college. Then one day, you read a story about a 15 year old from your hometown who died in a fiery car crash. And that was the real Kirk Godel. (shaves and puts on makeup) And you had a light bulb moment. All your life, people thought you were younger than you looked, so you decided to take advantage of that and hit a huge reset button on your life. You forged Kirk's documents. Then you went online and deleted his death certificate. A new identity plus your natural intelligence meant you were a cinch to make Meitner. Now you would graduate from one of the best high schools in the country, get a scholarship to the Ivys, and become a young captain of industry. And it was all rolling along beautifully until Hahn discovered your dirty little secret. (argues with HAHN knocking off pin) He blackmailed you for your scholarship stipend. He needed money to make a bank payment by Wednesday, money you weren't willing to pay. You were so distraught, you called your cousin to vent. You decided that the only way out was to kill Hahn, and make it look like an accident. (arranges fire with coffeepot) Finally, you hacked in and deleted all records that you were ever in juvie. Brilliant until the end. Well, until this...until this last part when you got caught, on the wild line. Like a salmon. Pencils down!

The students put down their pencils.

LASSITER:
(pulls KIRK up by the collar) Come on. )pushes him against the wall) Cuff him, O'Hara. (pulls cuffs from inside sling) But here, use mine. You've earned it.

JULIET:
(takes cuffs) Anything else I need to learn?

LASSITER:
There's one last lesson. Forget all the other lessons and know that you're a good cop.

JULIET cuffs "KIRK" and mouths "Thank you" to SHAWN.

LASSITER:
You know I'm gonna need those cuffs back, right? Good. (leaves)

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, BACK YARD, DAY

SHAWN and HENRY are playing chess and drinking lemonade.

HENRY:
Martinsdale.

SHAWN:
Macendale. Jay Macendale. Once we had the name, it was pretty easy to track the rest. When he was 15, he stole a car on a dare, accidentally killed a pedestrian. And that's what got him in juvie.

HENRY:
I can't believe he passed himself off as a teenager for this long.

SHAWN:
I don't know, Dad. Slap a wig on you, you're the spitting image of yourself when I was a kid.

GUS is on the porch talking to his parents on the phone.

GUS:
What is that supposed to mean?

HENRY:
What's his problem?

SHAWN:
He finally got a hold of his parents.

GUS:
Don't tell me it was too expensive. My file said I qualified for financial aid. Quality of life? They have 24-7 slushy machines there. The lockers are made with teak. That's the strongest wood.

HENRY:
(holds up one of the pieces) These pieces look like they're hand-carved, Shawn. What's with the generosity?

SHAWN:
I saw you were still using the ratty board with the plastic pieces so I went ahead and shoplifted this for you. I'm kidding. I bought it. Those kid geniuses turned me on to a great IPO. Now, remember, I win, I get the truck for a week. (makes a move)

HENRY:
All right, how 'bout, I win, you wash the truck for a week?

SHAWN:
Yeah, I really don't understand what that means. I'm out there in a pair of jean shorts...

HENRY:
Shawn, focus.

SHAWN:
...continuously washing the vehicle for a...

HENRY:
(points at board) Focus.

GUS:
(into phone) Too far to drive? You derailed my future because dad hates curvy roads? I could've been the next Wittgenstein. I never got carsick a day in my life.

SHAWN:
Gus doesn't deal very well with surprises.

GUS:
I'll talk to you later, Mom!

HENRY:
(leans over and whispers to SHAWN) You never told him I was the one who ran over his dog, did you?

SHAWN:
(looks over shoulder to GUS before whispering to HENRY) Dad, no! One thing at a time. Thank God that dog was 17.

(makes move) Checkmate. (stands and leaves)

HENRY slowly pushes over the pieces.

Episode 2x10 Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy

1987

EXT. FULLER'S YARD, DAY

A basketball sits on a lawn of overgrown grass, weeds and dead leaves. SHAWN and GUS peer over the fence.

SHAWN:
No one ever gets their ball back from mean Old Man Fuller's yard.

GUS:
This sucks.

EXT. GUSTERS' YARD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS drop back to the ground on their side of the fence and sit.

SHAWN:
I know. We were tied 114 to 114, and I was up.

GUS:
We weren't supposed to be playing with my new ball.

SHAWN:
I'll give you 1,000 outs if you go get it.

GUS:
2,000.

SHAWN:
Done.

They both stand and face the fence.

SHAWN:
(puts hands together to boost GUS) Ready?

GUS:
Okay, you got it. All right, almost got it. There I go...

GUS fall over the top of the fence into Fuller's yard.

SHAWN:
Gus!

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Is the ball all right?

GUS:
I can't get back over.

FULLER:
(off-screen) Get that ball off my grass! Get out of my yard!

SHAWN:
(slowly backs away) Gus, I'm really gonna miss ya. (runs away)

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk through the hall. SHAWN has a large Christmas bag over his shoulder as well as a Santa hat.

SHAWN:
Ho, ho, ho, ho. Buzz McNab. The Christmas spirits told me to give this to you. (pulls out a BB gun and hands it to the officer)

BUZZ:
Oh, my goodness, a Daisy Red Ryder. I had one of these when I was a kid. It was the reason I wanted to become a policeman.

SHAWN:
Well, Merry Christmas from me and Gus.

BUZZ:
Thanks, guys. (walks away)

GUS:
He's gonna shoot his eye out.

SHAWN:
Yes, he is.

GUS:
That was amazing. How did you know that?

SHAWN:
Uh, the room where I take naps shares a vent with the room where they do the psychological evals.

SHAWN passes out some other presents. He sets the bag down with a groan just as LASSITER walks up.

SHAWN:
Lassie! (holds out a "Psych" snow globe that contains GUS and himself)

LASSITER:
I-I hate snow globes.

SHAWN:
Now, that's strange. My psychic senses told me specifically that snow globes didn't give you nightmares about being trapped in a clear ball with snow that burns your skin off.

LASSITER hurries away.

SHAWN:
Well, Merry Christmas from me and Gus.

SHAWN then walks over towards JULIET and pulls out a cat toy.

SHAWN:
Mr. Mittens says it felt just like going to sleep, and he doesn't hold it against you at all. Kitty heaven, it's just like East Beach. (gives toy to JULIET)

JULIET:
That is the best news ever.

GUS:
(pats JULIET on the shoulder) Merry Christmas from both Shawn and...

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is a very special gift. It's clearly just from me. Don't appropriate. Not at Christmas time.

JULIET:
Thank you so much, Shawn.

SHAWN:
'Tis the season, Jules.

JULIET:
Wow! (puts arms out and walks towards SHAWN)

SHAWN puts his arms out, ready to accept a hug but she walks past him to her desk.

JULIET:
This is exactly what I need to get into the holiday spirit before my family arrives. (sits at desk)

SHAWN:
Oh, should I meet them, or is it too soon?

JULIET and GUS:
Too soon for what?

SHAWN:
Nothing. O'Hara family Christmas, huh?

JULIET:
My family's Christmas are the best. We have traditional Scottish games and music and crafts. You guys should totally come by tonight if you'd like.

SHAWN:
I do love a Scottish craft.

GUS elbows SHAWN in the side.

SHAWN:
But, uh, my father and I have been invited over to the Gusters' for an old-fashioned holiday dinner.

GUS:
Maybe next time.

SHAWN:
I can think of someone who could use a little cheer this time of year. Recently divorced.

GUS:
Separated.

SHAWN:
Estranged?

GUS:
Eh...

SHAWN:
Embattled?

GUS:
Yes.

SHAWN:
And all alone for the holidays.

SHAWN, GUS and JULIET look over towards LASSITER as he approaches his desk which is covered in snow globes.

LASSITER:
All right! Who keeps telling people I want snow globes for Christmas?

LASSITER looks around before picking them up gingerly, almost as if they were poisoned.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

GUS and SHAWN head down the hall towards the exit.

SHAWN:
Dude, I am really stoked. In over 20 years of friendship, I can count on one shop teacher's hand, the number of times your folks have had us over. I assume it's because they can't stand my father. Understandably.

GUS:
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say that.

SHAWN:
What would you say necessarily?

GUS:
Let's just say it's not because of your dad.

SHAWN:
What, your house is too small? Didn't have enough extra chairs?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Hiding a Jewish family in your attic?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
(stops) Wait a minute. It's not because of me.

GUS hems and haws, not wanting to answer.

SHAWN:
Gus? I can't believe this. I feel like Pep√© le Pew when he looked up "pew" in the dictionary. (French accent) Le Pew. Moi? No.

GUS:
My parents always thought you were a bad influence on me. Understandably.

SHAWN:
A bad influence?

GUS:
Yes.

SHAWN:
Dude, that's absurd.

GUS:
Because of you, Shawn, I got my first B, broke my first curfew, accidentally killed the state bird...

SHAWN:
How was I supposed to know he couldn't hold his own liquor? Now I know what to get your parents for Christmas.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I'm gonna lead 'em on a walk down memory lane, and give them the gift of seeing what a positive influence I have been on their son. (thrusts the bag at GUS and leaves)

INT. HENRY'S, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN watches as HENRY puts up a Christmas tree in a corner.

SHAWN:
Dad, why do you insist on getting a real tree? You probably chopped down some poor animal's home.

HENRY:
Yeah, that's the vicious little bastard right there. (points)

SHAWN looks and sees an ornamental squirrel on the mantel.

SHAWN:
Can we go, please? (walks away)

HENRY:
(puts hands up) Whoa, Shawn, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(stops and turns) Look, I don't wanna be late to the Gusters. It's important that this dinner go well.

HENRY:
Aren't you forgetting something? Your gift. (hands the cylindrical gift-wrapped package to SHAWN) Go on. Shake it, rattle it, feel it, sniff it. Do whatever the hell you want with it before it goes in that stocking. Then you got one week to figure out what it is.

SHAWN:
Dad, this ridiculous competition means way more to you than it does to me.

HENRY:
That's why you haven't won since you were eight-years-old.

SHAWN:
Christmas '92 was a draw. You know that.

HENRY:
Oh, so you do care. Go on.

SHAWN holds the package out in front of him before bringing it up to his eye like a telescope.

SHAWN:
(lowers gift) That's it.

HENRY:
That's it? You're sure?

SHAWN:
That's all I need. (reaches into back pocket and pulls out small gift) Oh, here's yours. (tosses present to HENRY) Merry Christmas.

HENRY holds the present in front of him at eye level before giving it a little shake.

SHAWN:
(chuckles) You are never...

HENRY:
Shh. (shakes gift) Wait, wait, wait.

SHAWN:
All right, time's up. In the stockings they go. (walks to fireplace and stands in front of stocking)

HENRY:
I'm gonna figure it out, Shawn. I always do. (stands by stocking)

BOTH:
Same time.

They both drop their presents into the stockings.

INT. GUSTERS', DINING ROOM, NIGHT

GUS sits at one side of the table, SHAWN and HENRY on the other. GUS' father BILL sits on one end. His mother WINNIE hands him a large stocking.

WINNIE:
Oh, I think there's a surprise in here for someone. (goes into the kitchen)

GUS:
I'm grown. You don't have to do this every year. (pulls out two $50 bills)

BILL:
We hear you, son, we hear ya. And we're sure you're very happy still being a sales rep. (pats GUS on the shoulder)

GUS:
I am. Pharmaceutical sales is a very desirable field.

BILL:
Of course, and you're doing very well for yourself. That's $100, boy.

GUS rolls his eyes and puts the money away. SHAWN looks at HENRY and points at GUS.

HENRY:
No. Not gonna happen.

WINNIE returns with the turkey on a platter.

WINNIE:
Turkey's ready!

HENRY:
Finally!

BILL:
It smells good, Winnie.

HENRY:
Why smell it when you can taste it?

HENRY reaches across in front of SHAWN and tries to stab a fork into the yams. SHAWN lifts HENRY'S arm at the elbow, pushing it away from the food. GUS takes the turkey from WINNIE and sets it on the table.

SHAWN:
Speaking of smoked turkey, you know why Gus isn't a smoker? 'Cause when we were kids I made him smoke an entire pack of cigarettes, and he discovered he hated the taste. Pretty good influence if I do say so myself.

WINNIE:
Probably what gave him asthma. (sits)

BILL:
Probably what stunted his growth, too.

GUS:
I'm five-ten-and-a-half.

BILL:
We hear you, son. We hear ya.

HENRY:
Gus, you're tall enough. Shawn, you're an idiot, and to be fair, there's a lot of complicated causes for asthma. Now, let's eat.

SHAWN:
You know, it was actually Gus' asthma medication that first interested him in pharmaceuticals. So you're welcome for that.

HENRY:
(holds plate in both hands) You made your point, Shawn. You're a good friend.

WINNIE:
Yes, you're very close. So close, I wonder if he wouldn't be married by now if he wasn't spending so much time (looks accusingly at SHAWN) with you.

HENRY puts his plate down on the table in frustration.

GUS:
Trust me. I get mine. I mean...I'm just waiting for Mrs. Right.

BILL:
We at least thought you'd have a house by now.

GUS:
I have time. The market's still cooling off.

HENRY:
Yeah. So's the food.

WINNIE:
You won't have time if you keep using all your extra energy with this gypsy detective agency nonsense you two have cooked up.

SHAWN:
(chuckles) Mrs. G., it's a psychic detective agency. (puts right hand to head and uses left as if to mime a sign) Psych.

WINNIE:
And how does this differ from that pet baptism business you had as kids?

SHAWN:
First of all, that was an LLC. And I'm the one that let Gus believe that Jesus was black. The whole time we were grow... (tries to recover after everyone stares at him) Growing up, which of course he is. He is that. That... he is that.

(lowers head)

EXT. STREET, NIGHT

SHAWN, GUS, HENRY, BILL and WINNIE are with a group of carolers walking down the street.

BILL:
I say we skip Old Man Fuller's house. Nobody wants to sing to his old, mean behind.

WINNIE:
Can't hear the song over his cussing anyway.

SHAWN runs along to the front of Fuller's house and stands on the front steps leading up from the sidewalk.

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, you guys! We're all adults now. Can't we let bygones be bygones? Even Old Man Fuller can use some Christmas spirit! Come on!

SHAWN leads the way up to the porch as everyone starts singing "We Wish You a Merry Christmas".

SHAWN:
(knocks on front door) Mr. Fuller!

GUS:
He would have been throwing rocks at us by now if he were here.

They start singing again and SHAWN opens the front door. They stop when they see Fuller hanging by a rope from the second floor bannister.

INT. FULLER'S, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

The police have arrived at the scene and are investigating. LASSITER is on the second floor examining the rope.

LASSITER:
Yeah, it's an apparent suicide, but, uh, we're still working the scene.

SHAWN looks around the room. He notices a bleeding mark on Fuller's head as he was being zipped into a body bag. He also notices a stain on the front of Fuller's shirt. He looks over at a chair with a small table set in front of it. There is a broken tea cup on the floor. On the arm of the chair rests a TV guide with upcoming shows circled.

SHAWN:
Dude, what if this wasn't suicide? What if this was murder?

GUS:
Shawn, it's Christmas time. Can you please leave work at the office? They've already moved on.

SHAWN:
Look, there is no way that an 80-year-old man in Fuller's condition could have hoisted himself over that bannister. And check it out. He was clearly looking forward to watching some TV tonight. While he ate his lobster.

GUS:
You may be on to something.

SHAWN:
Plus, I psych it up nice for your parents, they might be impressed, you know? Put on a little dance. Maybe they realize I'm not such a bad influence after all.

GUS:
Which may get them off my case for deciding to go into business with you.

SHAWN:
Now you're feeling me, you convertible LeBaron.

SHAWN and GUS fist-bump. HENRY opens the door and peers in.

HENRY:
Are you guys coming or what?

SHAWN:
Sure thing, Pop.

SHAWN and GUS walk slowly towards the door as the gurney bearing Fuller's body is wheeled over. SHAWN turns around, hands out.

SHAWN:
Stop! I'm sensing something.

HENRY enters the room. GUS stands by the door and ushers his parents inside.

GUS:
What is it, Shawn? Is it like the other 26 and a half crimes we solved for the police department?

SHAWN:
(grabs Santa hat in both hands) I'm sensing a struggle. (he groans as he pretends the hat is Fuller) Oh, please! (smacks the pom-pom at the top knocking it over) Fuller's unconscious.

GUS:
No, he was just an old man with a little soft skull.

SHAWN mimes wrapping a rope around the top of the hat, groaning as he does so.

SHAWN:
Oh, someone's wrapping a rope around his neck! What I'm sensing here, ladies and gentlemen, is murder.

LASSITER:
(comes downstairs) Spencer, old people are always offing themselves during the holidays.

BUZZ:
Well, according to CSU, Shawn might be right.

SHAWN:
Colorado State University?

GUS:
Crime scene unit.

SHAWN:
Them too.

LASSITER:
Let me see that. (takes notepad from BUZZ and reads) Blunt force trauma, signs of struggle.

BILL:
(looks at SHAWN) My Lord. He really is psychic.

WINNIE:
Maybe we were wrong about the boys working together... This time.

GUS makes a face of success behind his parents' backs.

LASSITER:
Right. Get him outta here. It's an open crime scene, people, I need witness statements from each and every one of you carolers. (checks watch) Crap, I'm running late.

SHAWN:
Lassie, come on, man. Handle your business. Gus and I will take 'em down to the station tomorrow.

GUS:
We have passes.

SHAWN:
Which practically makes us co-workers. (leans an arm on LASSITER'S shoulder) Isn't that right, Big L?

LASSITER takes SHAWN'S pinkie and pulls it backwards causing SHAWN to scream out. LASSITER lets go and walks to the door.

SHAWN:
That hurt, man!

LASSITER just glares at him before leaving.

SHAWN:
But when they cut us, we bleed blue.

INT. O'HARA'S, FRONT HALL, NIGHT

JULIET opens the front door to reveal LASSITER.

JULIET:
Carlton! Hi! (pulls him into a hug) I'm so glad you could make it! (closes door) I hope you're in a Hogmanay mood.

LASSITER:
I doubt it. Whatever that is.

INT. O'HARA'S, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

A group of JULIET'S extended family is in the living room celebrating. They look over to the hall to see who arrived.

MAN:
The first footer!

Everyone cheers.

INT. O'HARA'S, FRONT HALL, NIGHT

JULIET:
Oh, the first footer. It's Scottish tradition to celebrate the first visitor of the holidays. You.

LASSITER waves at everyone. They stare at him.

LASSITER:
(whispers to JULIET) Why are they all staring at me?

JULIET:
(whispers) Well, the first footer traditionally brings a gift of food.

LASSITER:
All I've got is a Clif bar in my car. I'd really prefer to save it for my morning run.

INT. O'HARA'S, KITCHEN, NIGHT

JULIET leads LASSITER over to a table set up by a window where three young boys are creating their own manger scenes.

JULIET:
So these are my nephews, Drake, Finn, and Isaac. Boys, this is Detective Lassiter. He works with Auntie Julie.

LASSITER gives the boys a salute but they just stare at him.

LASSITER:
I like it better in here already.

JULIET:
I was helping them with their Christmas crafts. It's always my favorite part.

DRAKE:
(take's JULIET'S hand) Look at this, Auntie Julie!

ISSAC:
Look at mine!

FINN:
Look at mine!

The boys clamor for their aunt's attention.

JULIET:
Oh, my goodness. This looks fantastic, but you know, maybe Detective Lassiter would like to help out. (nods towards the boys)

LASSITER:
Sure. (sits) All right, fellas, what do we got going on here? Well, you know, Drake, technically Jesus was born around April, so we need to get rid of this winter foliage. (pulls the pieces from DRAKE'S nativity) Oh, and, Finn, the word "manger" actually refers to the wooden feeding trough that the animals used, so let's put baby Jesus in this little shot glass. (takes shot glass from the island and drops Jesus into it) Perfect.

JULIET:
Carlton...

LASSITER:
Well, you know, based on how far they had to travel, all the experts agree that the wise men didn't really get there until Jesus was two, so let's get rid of them. (tosses them aside)

JULIET:
Uh, uh, Carlton, remember, this is for the children.

LASSITER:
Right. Let's do one with Santa in it. Hand me Kris Kringle there, guys.

DRAKE hands LASSITER a Santa from the windowsill.

JULIET:
That's a great idea!

LASSITER:
You know, interestingly enough, the Dutch version of Santa used slaves to deliver the toys.

JULIET shakes her head.

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS arrive with WINNIE and BILL. GUS knocks on the door.

SHAWN:
We're here to give our official statements for the Fuller case.

LASSITER:
Yes. About that. Um, our investigation has confirmed Mr. Spencer's hunches.

SHAWN:
Ah, really? (to the Gusters) He was murdered.

GUS:
That's 27 and counting.

LASSITER:
Do you folks mind coming on in for a moment? Just have a seat. Make yourselves comfortable. Chair's right over there. I thought we could, uh, have more privacy this way.

BILL holds a chair out for WINNIE as LASSITER closes the door.

SHAWN:
Why? What, is there a problem?

LASSITER:
Well, this report says that there were traces of weed killer found in Mr. Fuller's system.

SHAWN:
Poison. I sensed that as well.

LASSITER:
There's just one slight problem. We found a box of the same type of weed killer on Mr. Guster's property. Can you explain that?

BILL:
Whoa, whoa, now. Slow your roll. I can explain that. Me and Fuller had a long-time feud about the property line. And every now and then I'd poison his shrubs because he refused to cut them back.

WINNIE:
Bill, that's not like you.

LASSITER:
How about this? Blunt force trauma to the head of the deceased was done caused by a bloody hammer found nearby with prints belonging to a Mr. William Guster.

BILL:
Yeah, but if you'd looked a little closer, you would have found a hacksaw and a pickaxe with my prints on them too. Fuller had been taking my tools for years. That's another reason we'd been feuding.

SHAWN:
Another perfectly reasonable explanation.

LASSITER:
Just one more thing, the rope used to hang Mr. Fuller matches rope from a boat belonging to...

BILL:
Let me guess. Me. (laughs)

SHAWN and GUS join in the forced laughter.

GUS:
That's crazy.

SHAWN:
Mr. G.

BILL:
(notices LASSITER and JULIET'S straight faces) Wait. You mean it really was mine? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (stands) Look, I just said that to be funny. I have no idea how it got there.

LASSITER:
I am sorry, Mr. Guster, the evidence is strong enough. You have the right to remain silent. (walks behind BILL)

BILL:
What?

LASSITER:
You give up that right, anything you say...

WINNIE:
(stands) No, wait!

BILL:
You can't arrest me!

LASSITER:
...and will be used against you in a court of law.

BILL:
I'm a deacon in a church!

LASSITER:
You have a right to an attorney. (leads BILL out the door)

BILL:
What will the Lord say?

INT. HENRY'S, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN, GUS, HENRY and WINNIE walk into the kitchen. GUS pulls out a chair for his mother and she sits.

WINNIE:
It's very nice of you to invite us over.

HENRY:
Oh, Winnie, it's the least I could do. Now when is Bill gonna be released from custody?

WINNIE:
Soon I hope. A thing like this could be devastating though to somebody with delicate health and weak disposition.

GUS:
We're gonna get Dad out before anything can happen to him.

WINNIE:
I was talking about you. Your father's strong as an ox, but you... Lord knows you have enough stress to deal with as it is.

SHAWN:
Mrs. G., you have my word, everything will be fine. We're gonna take this case.

GUS:
(sits next to WINNIE) Yeah.

HENRY:
Shawn, how about we get some food together here?

HENRY and SHAWN walk towards the fridge and have a whispered conversation.

HENRY:
Maybe you oughta pass on this one.

SHAWN:
I can't, Dad. I owe it to them.

HENRY:
(takes leftovers from fridge) Look, the Gusters are nice people, okay? They invite you over for dinner at 6:00. They don't serve till 6:30. So what? The point is, as a rule, you never wanna get involved in a case where personal relationships are involved.

SHAWN grabs a pineapple from the fridge before closing the door. He joins HENRY at the counter by the window.

SHAWN:
Dad, I think I can handle it.

HENRY:
What if Gus's dad is guilty?

SHAWN:
Are you out of your mind? How could you even say that?

HENRY:
(wags finger at SHAWN) That's what I mean. Right there, Shawn. You've already made your decision irrespective of the facts. You have already compromised this case.

SHAWN:
Compromised? Why? Because I'm not afraid of my own emotional attachment? I'll have you know that I view that as a tool in my problem-solving, not a liability.

HENRY:
It is that exact kind of lame-ass thinking... I can see why you were never a detective.

SHAWN:
And I can see why you ended up a divorced detective.

They glare at each other before SHAWN checks his watch.

SHAWN:
My God. We went almost three hours without having an argument.

HENRY:
It's our best holiday in years, huh?

INT. O'HARA'S, FRONT HALL, DAY

There's a knock on the front door and JULIET opens it to see LASSITER standing there with a present.

JULIET:
Oh.

LASSITER:
Uh, I was just arresting someone in the neighborhood. I thought I'd drop by and say hi.

JULIET:
Oh, you know, we just sat down to lunch, so... Sorry.

The boys come running to the door.

LASSITER:
Hey, guys. Look what I've got. (steps inside and gives the boys the box)

The boys open the present.

DRAKE:
A Wii!

ISSAC:
Whoa!

FINN:
Awesome! (takes the console from the box)

JULIET:
Wow, that's actually very thoughtful. Thank you.

LASSITER:
It turned up in a sweep. I mean, they're welcome to use it, but technically it belongs to the D.A.'s office.

ISSAC:
Come on!

BOYS:
Let's play boxing! (they hurry down the hall)

LASSITER:
(to JULIET) You're not busy? (follows boys)

JULIET:
No, no. Go right ahead. (closes door and follows)

INT. O'HARA'S, KITCHEN, DAY

LASSITER is sitting with DRAKE in front of a TV, beating him in boxing.

LASSITER:
Oh, oh, Drake, you're too slow, my friend! You better change your name to Lassiter because I own you! Oh, he's down on the ground!

O'HARA and the boys simply stare at him.

DRAKE:
What a lame-o. (stands and walks away)

JULIET, ISSAC and FINN walk out with DRAKE. LASSITER doesn't even notice.

LASSITER:
Come on. Who's next? Who's next? Come on! Let's go! Somebody come get some! Who's next? Get some! Come on!

EXT. GUSTERS' HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS have driven WINNIE home and GUS helps her from the car.

WINNIE:
You guys sure you don't wanna take a sandwich or anything for the road? You hardly ate any of your food.

SHAWN:
Ooh, I remember once when we were little you made us these chicken cordon bleus.

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
But the ham was so thin...

GUS:
Shawn! We don't have an appetite. All we can think about is clearing Dad's name and getting him out of jail.

SHAWN gets in the car and shuts the door.

GUS:
I'll give you a call as soon as we have any leads.

GUS and WINNIE hug. SHAWN'S phone rings and he answers.

SHAWN:
Dad. No, it is not an engraved set of rubber bullets. Why would I possibly give you another excuse to shoot a gun? Well, you better keep thinking.

SHAWN gets in the car, closes the door and puts on his seatbelt.

GUS:
Shawn, I don't have to tell you how important this case is. So whatever you need, just let me know.

SHAWN puts on his seatbelt as GUS starts the car. He barely drives a few yards when SHAWN tells him to stop.

SHAWN:
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

GUS:
What? What is it?

SHAWN:
Give me a second. (studies Fuller's place)

GUS:
Is it a clue that clears my dad?

SHAWN:
Can you shush for one second? I know you think this is easy for me, but I do go through a mental process. Like A equals B. B equals c. Which means A equals... (shoves GUS away) Would you stop it? That's too close! Now I gotta start all over. (goes back to studying the house)

GUS:
Damn it, Shawn, what's taking so long?

SHAWN:
Okay! All right! We need to figure out if there was a homeowner's association.

They get out of the car.

EXT. MITCHELLS' HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS knock on the front door of a neighbor's house. Mr. MITCHELL answers the door.

SHAWN:
Ah, Mr. Mitchell.

MITCHELL:
Yes.

SHAWN:
My name is Shawn Spencer.

MITCHELL:
I'm not interested in any fake vacation packages. I'm not giving you my social security number so I can claim the grand prize, and I'm not paying for any damn subscriptions for magazines that I know I'll never see. (slams the door closed)

SHAWN:
(loudly) I'm the head psychic for the Santa Barbara police department.

MITCHELL:
(opens door) Oh. Well, come on in then.

SHAWN and GUS enter the house and MITCHELL closes the door behind them.

INT. MITCHELLS' HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stand on one side of the counter and MITCHELL stands on the other.

SHAWN:
We're investigating the death of Mr. Fuller. And I am sensing some unresolved conflict between the two of you. Something... something to do with rules and violations.

MITCHELL:
Yes, it's true. Fuller became a constant thorn in my side ever since I started the homeowner's association. He refused to follow the ordinances. When I'd give him citations, he'd tear them up and throw them in the trash. So I'd give him another citation. It was a constant, vicious cycle. (turns to the counter)

GUS:
It's him. He did it. Bust him, Shawn. See it, see it. See it. (grabs SHAWN'S hand and pushes it to his head, trying to make him have a "vision")

SHAWN:
(pushes GUS' hand away) Stop it. Stop...

MITCHELL turns back and they stop fighting.

SHAWN:
Sounds like you wanted him out of the way.

MITCHELL:
No, no, not at all. He was a pain, but he was our best supporter.

SHAWN:
Our?

MITCHELL:
The Mitchell family. We founded this neighborhood 100 years ago. Now we're lobbying the city to have them declare it a historical district. Fuller refused to sell his house after all these years. We were the only friends he had.

GLADYS MITCHELL enters the kitchen.

GLADYS:
Hello.

MITCHELL:
Oh, hi, honey. This is Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster.

GLADYS:
I remember the two of you from when you were no more than yea high. You had the cutest little lawn-mowing business.

SHAWN and GUS walk around to meet her.

SHAWN:
Oh, wow, that's right. We did.

GLADYS:
In fact I think we paid you $5.00 for a job that never got done.

They all laugh.

SHAWN:
(points at GUS) Oh! This guy.

GLADYS:
You know, the yard tools are out back. I'll go get them. (leaves)

SHAWN:
She's, uh...She's not serious, is she? She is.

EXT. MITCHELLS' HOUSE, BACK YARD, DAY

SHAWN is struggling to push an old-fashioned lawn mower as GUS waters the plants.

GLADYS:
(steps out onto the porch) Oh, and make sure to water the gardenias. I've had them longer than you've been alive.

GUS fakes a laugh as GLADYS goes back inside. GUS continues to water and SHAWN pushes the lawnmower until he gives up in frustration.

SHAWN:
This is ridiculous! She should've just accepted the $5 refund offer.

GUS:
We need to be solving my dad's case.

SHAWN looks over towards Fuller's house and sees someone pull down the shades.

SHAWN:
Dude. (walks to gate and peers through) There's somebody in Old Man Fuller's house.

GUS runs over, pushes SHAWN aside and leaves through the gate.

SHAWN:
I can't believe we're gonna bail on the Mitchells' yard again.

GUS:
Come on!

SHAWN creeps out the gate after GUS.

EXT. FULLER'S HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS jog up the front stairs and GUS cautiously reaches for the front door but it opens before he touches it. A WOMAN dressed in a business suit with a clipboard in hand steps outside and closes the door behind her.

GUS:
Who are you, and what are you doing here?

WOMAN:
I should ask you the same thing.

SHAWN notices hand-drawn landscape plans for the front yard.

SHAWN:
My name's Shawn. This is my partner, Skooney "U-turn" Singleton. We're from Dirty Boy Landscaping. I got a call from your office, said you needed some estimates on some renovations.

WOMAN:
You guys are fast. I just left word at the office saying I needed a landscape architect. You know, I cold-called this geezer for years pushing him to sell, and he always refused. Finally it's available.

GUS:
Really?

SHAWN:
What's so special about this place?

WOMAN:
It's the only lot in the neighborhood with 360-degree unobstructed views. (walks to the edge of the porch and looks out at the street) It'll sell for a fortune.

SHAWN and GUS look at each other.

GUS:
Don't worry, this yard will be immaculate when we're done. Bye-bye.

WOMAN:
Be in touch. (goes back inside)

SHAWN and GUS walk down the steps towards the street.

GUS:
You hear her, Shawn? She's been cold-calling for years. And she stands to make a fortune on this place. That's motive. Right?

SHAWN:
(stops on sidewalk) Yeah, yeah.

GUS:
It's gotta be her. What more do we need? Let's get the cops on it right away.

SHAWN:
I, I guess it wouldn't, uh, hurt to have them do a cursory background check. Maybe, maybe look... Look at the phone records.

GUS:
Right. (slaps SHAWN on the back and hurries to the car)

SHAWN:
Yeah. Okay. (follows slowly)

>>> LATER >>>

SHAWN and GUS are hiding behind some bushes watching the WOMAN as she talks with a possible buyer(?) for the house. LASSITER and JULIET pull up in LASSITER'S car.

WOMAN:
I'll do everything in my power to make this process as painless as possible.

SHAWN:
Jules. Jules, over here!

JULIET walks over to them as LASSITER looks away as he heads to the GUSTERS'.

GUS:
It's about time.

SHAWN:
Did you check the phone records?

JULIET:
Yep, your tip paid off.

SHAWN:
That's great. Thank goodness. There were all these vibes, but I wasn't sure.

GUS:
So it was Rosa.

JULIET:
Who?

GUS:
The real estate agent.

SHAWN and GUS point to the WOMAN and JULIET turns to look at her before turning back to SHAWN and GUS.

JULIET:
No, no. She has a solid alibi. But we discovered quite a few calls from someone else, who also made numerous cash transfers into Fuller's account. Possibly paying off a blackmail.

GUS:
Wait a second, if you're not about to arrest Rosa, what are you doing standing here?

JULIET:
Distracting you.

SHAWN:
Distracting...

SHAWN turns around to see LASSITER walking down the GUSTERS' front path with WINNIE. She is in handcuffs.

JULIET:
Sorry, Gus.

GUS:
Shawn! Shawn! (runs over) Lassiter, get off my mom!

SHAWN looks at JULIET and holds his arms out in disbelief before going after GUS.

LASSITER:
No, no, no, Mr. Guster! Mr. Guster.

WINNIE:
Burton, Burton, please. Don't make a scene, darling. The neighbors. Neighbors are watching us. What is this? (licks her thumb and tries to wipe GUS' face)

LASSITER:
Get in the car, ma'am. Please. Watch your head. (puts a hand to the top of the doorway to protect her head)

WINNIE:
Don't! Don't you touch my hair!

LASSITER puts his hands up defensively. WINNIE gets into the back seat of the car. They soon drive away leaving SHAWN and GUS standing on the sidewalk. SHAWN puts a hand on GUS' back as they watch the car drive away.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

WINNIE is sitting at the table, BILL and GUS standing on either side of her.

SHAWN:
We got here as fast as we could.

BILL:
This is our worst nightmare. It seems like everything is conspiring against us. So we lawyered up. That's how they say it in the bucket, son. Where I did an eight-hour bid.

SHAWN has walked over to stand beside GUS.

WINNIE:
I don't know those words. (sobs) I'm not gonna do well in prison.

BILL:
(wraps an arm around WINNIE) Don't worry, sweetheart. You'll be fine. (mouths to GUS over WINNIE'S head) She's not gonna make it.

GUS:
I told you, nobody's going to prison.

SHAWN:
Mrs. G, why didn't you tell anybody that Old Man Fuller was blackmailing you for all these years?

WINNIE:
I wanted to, believe me, I did, but I couldn't. You see, this all started when Bill's sailboat caught fire. I tried to muster up the courage to tell everybody that it was my fault. But before I could, the insurance company had paid everything off already. Well, somehow, Fuller knew the truth of what had happened. He threatened to turn me in for insurance fraud if I didn't pay him every month. Well, he was so old, I figured paying him off for the rest of his life was the cheapest route.

GUS:
To the police it looks like motive.

WINNIE:
I know. But don't worry, son. We have called Nana. She's to look after you in case anything should happen to the two of us.

GUS:
Mom, I don't need my grandmother, who lives in a nursing home to look after me.

BILL:
We hear you, son. We hear you. Anyway, it's just until we can raise the money to post your mother's bail and pay our legal bills.

GUS:
Whatever the cost is, I'll cover it. Don't worry about it.

BILL:
We appreciate the gesture, Burton. But, son, we're talking real money.

GUS:
You have a savings account in a penny jar. I have a 401-K, a diversified asset-allocated portfolio full of securities and equity to tap into.

WINNIE:
He's always been so good with the big words. (turns to BILL) How much do you think we can get for the Cutlass, dear?

GUS:
Stop it! I can't take anymore! All of my life it's been "Gus can't handle this!" "Protect Gus from that!" Well, guess what? I'm the most responsible, well-prepared, non-criminal-record-having adult in this room. And it's high time you two stopped babying me. I'm 29-years-old. And by the way, I know you've only been married for 28 years. I did the math a long time ago. So stop protecting me from that. Starting now, I'm gonna take care of you. I'm gonna give you money. (puts an arm around SHAWN'S shoulders) And we're gonna solve this case. Shawn may not have always been the best influence on me, but he's always believed in me, even when I didn't believe in myself. And right now, I believe in him.

BILL:
We hear ya, son.

BILL walks over to GUS and holds out his hand. GUS takes his hand from SHAWN'S shoulders and grips his dad's in a firm shake.

SHAWN:
(whispers) All right, dude. You had your moment, man. You nailed it. Now go ahead and make a timely exit. Come on, Before you gotta make another speech.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

GUS closes the door to the interrogation room behind him as he follows SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Your mom being arrested might be Christmas miracle we need for the case. (heads up the stairs)

GUS:
How so?

SHAWN:
(stops) I suspect she wasn't the only one in the neighborhood that Old Man Fuller was blackmailing. We gotta get back in his house.

SHAWN jogs up the stairs and GUS follows.

INT. FULLER'S, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS go up the stairs to the hall overlooking the living room. SHAWN heads to the spot where Fuller was found hanging. He notices rope marks on the bannister at the top of the stairs. There are also notes taped to the wall in obvious spots with simple reminders such as "Lock the door", "Turn off stove" and "Keys".

GUS:
Let's hurry up. This place gives me the creeps.

INT. FULLER'S, STUDY, DAY

They enter a room that has a bow window with a telescope set up in front of them. GUS looks through the closet. SHAWN sits in the rocking chair facing the windows and has a perfect view of the street.

SHAWN:
Bingo! (turns to look at GUS) This must be how Old Man Fuller saw your mom burn your dad's boat.

GUS walks over to stand behind SHAWN and steps on a creaky floorboard. SHAWN looks down and GUS tries it again.

SHAWN:
(stands) Dude, there's something in there.

GUS:
What do you think it is? (steps on board again)

SHAWN shakes his head and GUS bends over. SHAWN makes the sound of a heartbeat. GUS glares at him and SHAWN puts on an innocent face. GUS makes to go down again and SHAWN imitates a heartbeat once more. They repeat their actions a third time.

GUS:
Will you stop it, Shawn? You know how that story gives me the creeps.

SHAWN continues with the heartbeats, a little faster this time. GUS kneels down and moves the rocking chair with his hands.

GUS:
(in high-pitched voice) Norman! Norman!

SHAWN:
(nervously) Stop.

GUS:
Norman!

SHAWN:
Okay, stop it, that's enough! That's enough! Game over.

GUS:
Fine.

SHAWN slowly kneels down and then reaches his hands to his heart, ready to make the sound effects. GUS reaches for the rocking chair.

GUS:
Don't play, Shawn.

Together, they reach down and pry up the floorboard to reveal binoculars, a camera with a telescopic lens as well as a tripod. SHAWN pulls out a beat-up envelope.

SHAWN:
Just as I thought. He was snooping on the entire neighborhood from up here. These are his blackmail pictures. (pulls out photos) Suburban pot farm. Bootleg DVD ring. None of these are really cause for murder. (sees a pictures of lovers through a window - the woman's face is hidden but there is a wedding ring) Covering an illicit affair. Now that's what I call motive. (looks at the distinctive window frame)

GUS:
What?

SHAWN stands and walks to the window. Using the camera, he examines the windows of the surrounding houses.

GUS:
You see anything?

SHAWN keeps looking.

GUS:
Hurry up.

SHAWN:
(finds the matching window) I know where our culprit lives.

EXT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN knocks on the front door and a young MAN answers.

SHAWN:
Hey. Got some questions for you about some illicit pictures. (holds up envelope)

The MAN takes off running back into the house and GUS runs after him.,/i>

SHAWN:
Man.

EXT. STREET, DAY

The MAN runs out of his yard and SHAWN and GUS run into each other while chasing him. The MAN runs down an alley.

SHAWN:
But we already know where you live!

SHAWN and GUS run after him to the strains of "Jingle Bells" by the Brian Setzer Orchestra. GUS takes the lead and SHAWN takes a shortcut through some backyards finally swinging out on a rope, knocking the MAN down. GUS trudges over, having stopped running when he saw SHAWN.

SHAWN:
We call that "Sammy Floyd's tree house ambush."

SHAWN reaches down and gives the MAN a hand up.

MAN:
Okay, okay. Okay. You got me. I'll give you your pictures back.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We have pictures of you, Dude. The ones Old Man Fuller was blackmailing you for. What pictures are you talking about?

MAN:
I work at a one-hour photo. I thought you were asking about the pictures of hot, naked chicks I sometimes keep.

GUS:
Wait a minute. (holds up picture) This isn't you?

MAN:
No. But it kinda looks like my dad from about 30 years ago when we first moved here.

SHAWN:
Man, it was an old picture mixed in with the new ones. We couldn't tell the difference because they're all black and white.

GUS:
So we're looking for his dad?

SHAWN:
Yes.

MAN:
He passed away a few years ago.

SHAWN:
(shakes head) No. Who's this woman in the photo?

MAN:
It's not my mom. That's for sure. She died before we moved here.

SHAWN:
Well, who the hell is she?

MAN:
(puts hands up defensively) You know, don't really feel comfortable talking about my family secrets, all right?

GUS:
What's the name of that one-hour photo where you hide your filthy debauchery?

MAN:
I remember my dad had a female friend who would visit only at night.

SHAWN:
Uh-huh. What was her name?

MAN:
I don't remember.

GUS:
Do you know she lives?

MAN:
No.

SHAWN:
Can you tell us anything? I just swung from a tree.

MAN:
When she left the house would smell like White Linen perfume. I remember it because it was the same perfume my mom used to wear when she was alive.

SHAWN sighs.

GUS:
So our culprit is a woman?

SHAWN:
Apparently. Who looked like that 30 years ago.

MAN:
Yeah. She's hot.

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
You have problems.

SHAWN and GUS walk away.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is sitting at her desk, typing at the computer when LASSITER walks by. He swerves and leans against the column by JULIET'S desk.

LASSITER:
You know, I was thinking, if you guys have an extra seat at that table for Christmas dinner, I might be available.

JULIET:
Carlton, I haven't been completely honest with you. You see, family...

LASSITER:
Say no more. Don't worry. I won't come around anymore. (starts to walks away)

JULIET:
I am so sorry, Carlton.

LASSITER:
(comes back) Don't be. I mean it's. It's totally natural for you to be jealous if your nephews like me more than you.

JULIET:
Come again?

LASSITER:
I get it. You're used to being the cool aunt that everyone wants to hang out with. But when I'm around, you just can't compete with that. Sometimes I just... I forget to dial down my coolness when I'm around kids. They're just so impressionable.

JULIET:
(nods) You are so right. I can't compete with that.

LASSITER:
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. All right, I'm sure your nephews still think you're really fly. (leaves)

JULIET:
Merry Christmas, Carlton.

INT. GUSTERS', KITCHEN, DAY

GUS and SHAWN enter through the back door with a large paper bag. WINNIE comes from the front of the house, mail in hand. BILL is at the counter.

GUS:
Great news. We're following a new lead on the case.

WINNIE:
That's great because I just got my notice to appear in court just in time for Christmas. (sits at table)

BILL:
Look at this. An announcement for Old Man Fuller's estate sale. Making people buy back stuff that was probably already theirs in the first place.

SHAWN takes Styrofoam containers from the bag as GUS takes the notice from his father.

SHAWN:
I don't know what they put in this stuff, but the jerk chicken from Kingston's has always been the best.

BILL walks over to the table.

GUS:
Let me see. (takes container from SHAWN, opens it and sniffs) Well, they got the right ratio of black pepper, scotch bonnet, and thyme.

BILL:
Hey, son. (sniffs after GUS walks over) Whoo. I ain't mad at that. But they should have used a quarter less pimento.

SHAWN watches in amazement.

GUS:
Mom. (holds container for WINNIE)

WINNIE:
(sniffs) Minced nutmeg instead of ground.

GUS walks back to the counter and stands opposite SHAWN.

SHAWN:
My God. Gus, you came by the super smeller honest.

SHAWN looks at the notice on the counter and remembers.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

EXT. STREET, DAY

MAN:
She also smelled like, yeah, White Linen perfume.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. GUSTERS', KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN:
Dude, can the super smeller pick out a scent from memory?

GUS:
Well, the olfactory and memory areas of the cerebral cortex share the same neural pathways.

SHAWN:
What is that? Is that a yes?

GUS:
Yes.

SHAWN:
Sweet! I think I know how to solve the case! Come on! (runs out the door)

GUS:
We'll be back. (follows SHAWN)

EXT. FULLER'S HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN stands on the front lawn by a sign for the estate sale. He's on the phone. GUS stands behind him, watching the people on the porch.

SHAWN:
Jules, I'm getting a major psychic disturbance down at Old Man Fuller's estate sale. You might wanna get down here. Okay. Hurry. (ends call and turns to GUS) Check it out. If our culprit's here, she's gonna wanna get a hold of those photos.

GUS:
Right.

SHAWN:
If she's like most old ladies, she probably thinks you were on The Jeffersons, and she wears the same perfume from her youth. (pulls perfume bottle from his pocket) All you gotta do is identify who's wearing White Linen. I'll take care of the rest.

GUS:
Got it.

SHAWN spritzes the perfume in front of GUS who sniffs.

SHAWN:
You ready?

GUS:
Yep.

They hurry towards the house.

INT. FULLER'S, LIVING ROOM, DAY

There is a podium set up opposite the front door with rows of chairs that were occupied by a mixed crowd. There were also some standing in the back.

AUCTIONEER:
Ladies and Gentlemen, the next item up for bidding is this one-of-a-kind...

GUS "accidentally" drops his keys next to a woman sitting in the back row.

GUS:
Excuse me.

GUS bends over to pick up his keys and sniffs the woman as he straightens. He continues to sniff the women in the crowd as the auction goes on.

AUCTIONEER:
...antique Confederate Civil War battle flag. Who will open the bidding at $100? May I have $100? Thank you. I have $100 to open the bidding. How about $200? Can I hear $200? $200. Thank you. $200. Can I hear $300? $300? Anyone. Thank you, sir, $300. Do I hear $400? Who will say $400? Do I hear $400? Who will go $400? Thank you. I have $400. Do I have $500? $500? $500, who will... Thank you. I have $500.

SHAWN:
Come on. Any luck?

GUS:
No old lady in here is wearing White Linen.

SHAWN:
Sweet. That's our only lead.

AUCTIONEER:
Sold! To the man in the blue argyle sweater for $500, this antique Confederate battle flag. Thank you for bidding, sir. Enjoy your flag.

A young WOMAN walks over and holds the flag out to GUS.

WOMAN:
Here you go.

GUS yanks it from her hands.

SHAWN:
You can totally get a gun rack for your truck now.

GUS smacks him. SHAWN turns to see JULIET and LASSITER arrive.

AUCTIONEER:
Next item up for bidding is this box of heirlooms. Antique photographs.

SHAWN:
Dude, I don't know what to do.

AUCTIONEER:
$100 to open.

GUS:
You better do something.

SHAWN:
Super smeller was supposed to smell it, right?

In the front row, GLADYS raises her hand.

AUCTIONEER:
Thank you. I have $100. Who will go $200?

SHAWN notices dirt under GLADYS' fingernails.

FLASHBACK

EXT. MITCHELLS' HOUSE, BACK YARD, DAY

GLADYS:
Oh, and make sure to water the gardenias. I've had them longer than you've been alive.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. FULLER'S, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN takes out the perfume bottle and spritzes it in front of GUS again.

SHAWN:
Identify the base component of that fragrance.

GUS:
(takes two deep sniffs) Gardenia.

SHAWN:
Are you absolutely certain?

GUS:
Tahitian gardenia.

SHAWN:
Thank you. (mumbles) Now give me a push.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(whispers) Give me a little push.

GUS:
I'm not pushing you...

SHAWN:
Would you just-

GUS pushes SHAWN who runs into LASSITER. The detective catches him and pushes him away.

SHAWN:
(grunts before talking in a deeper, older voice) Get that ball off my grass, Guster! Get out of my yard! If you kids don't keep it quiet out there, I'm gonna call the cops! (stumbles to the front of the room where the AUCTIONEER steadies him)

GUS:
He's channeling Old Man Fuller's grumpy drunken spirit.

SHAWN:
What's that? What's that, you miserable old geezer? The cops have the wrong suspects. Well, then who's the killer? Gladys Mitchell? (points at GLADYS)

Flashbacks show what SHAWN is describing.

SHAWN:
30 years ago you... You used to deliver flowers to the nice little widower who moved in down the street. One thing led to another. The next thing you knew, you were locked in a torrid, illicit affair. Dirty, sweaty, an affair that if it got to the public would not only ruin your marriage, but soil the good name of the neighborhood's founding family.

GLADYS stands, ready to protest but SHAWN doesn't let her.

SHAWN:
Old Man Fuller knew your secret! He could see everything from his snooping perch. In exchange for his silence, you had to cater to all of his needs for the better part of 30 years. But oh, that bastard just wouldn't die, would he? No, it was as if his meanness was keeping him alive. And then your worst nightmare became a reality. He started going senile. You couldn't risk him telling somebody about the affair, so you took matters into your own hands, and you killed the son of a bitch!

GLADYS:
That's absurd. I couldn't possibly hang a grown man from up there.

SHAWN:
I can see it. (staggers back and picks up a teacup) You tried to poison him! But he spit it out. (hands cup to AUCTIONEER) Then you panicked. You grabbed a hammer. (imitates using a hammer) You tried to bash in his skull! But no, he just wouldn't die! His little feet twitching this way and that! In a really desperate move, you grabbed the disoriented Fuller! You pushed him over to the base of the stairs. (pushes GUS onto the chair lift) You found yourself a nice piece of rope. You tied one end around his neck! You draped the other end over the bannister and you tied it to the chair lift. And then you used that chair lift to pull Old Man Fuller all the way up and over the bannister at this ridiculous, agonizing pace. (GUS is on the lift going horribly slow) And that is how you killed that ancient, pruney relic.

GLADYS:
(turns to husband) I'm so sorry, honey. I just couldn't let him ruin everything that we worked so hard to build.

JULIET walks over and cuffs GLADYS' hands behind her back.

LASSITER:
Guster, you can tell your parents we're gonna drop the charges.

GUS:
Whoo! (pumps fist) Good work, Shawn.

SHAWN holds his fist out for a bump but GUS ignores it.

GUS:
You've already had your moment. (rides the lift down)

INT. HENRY'S, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

The Gusters and SHAWN watch as HENRY readies to light the Christmas tree.

HENRY:
All right, let's light this puppy up.

HENRY plugs in the tree and everyone claps.

HENRY:
Well, Shawn, it looks like another draw this year?

SHAWN:
Yes. It appears so.

HENRY and SHAWN exchange presents. SHAWN opens his and sees yellow golf balls with the Psych logo on them.

SHAWN:
Look at that. Little Psych golf balls. (passes them around)

HENRY:
I also signed you up for lessons with the golf pro down at the Santa Barbara municipal course.

SHAWN:
That's sweet, Dad. Thank you. All right, your turn.

HENRY:
All right. I have no idea what this is. (opens box and finds note) What is this? (reads) "Dear Dad, you got me monogrammed Psych golf balls and golf lessons with the pro down at the municipal course."

SHAWN:
Turn it over, turn it over, turn it over.

HENRY:
(turns over note and reads) "I believe his name is Pierre."

SHAWN:
Boo-yah! I got you, old man! (laughs and jumps up and down)

HENRY:
That's it, Shawn, you know, this is the last year we're gonna play this stupid little game.

SHAWN:
Somebody doesn't like to lose. Because you're an old Grinch during Christmastime. The name is Ebenezer Grinch man.

HENRY:
Stop. Stop!

SHAWN:
Grinch of the Cruise Scrooge grinchies.

GUS notices WINNIE and BILL put off by SHAWN'S antics.

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
Here you go. Here's your real gift. (reaches down and gives HENRY a larger box)

HENRY:
What?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

HENRY:
Wait, what's it gonna do?

SHAWN:
Just give her a rip. So what's there? What's in there?

HENRY:
(opens box and takes out snow globe) Look at that. That's me fishing. (laughs)

SHAWN:
In the snow.

HENRY:
(holds globe upside-down) That's good, it's snowing! That's really nice, Shawn. That's great. Thank you. (hugs SHAWN) Thank you. All right.

WINNIE:
Thank you. Thank you for a lovely dinner. I think we should be going now.

BILL:
Yes. Thank you.

HENRY:
It was my pleasure. Merry Christmas.

BILL:
Merry Christmas.

HENRY:
(to SHAWN) I got a perfect place for this.

GUS:
You all should get some rest. You've been through a lot. (puts an arm around WINNIE)

WINNIE:
Finally things can get back to the way they were.

BILL:
Well, almost. I've been thinking, maybe we could use some advice about that diversification stuff. Seems like you're doing pretty good for yourself.

WINNIE:
And making some good business decisions. (looks at SHAWN)

GUS:
Sure! No problem. Let me go get the car. Mr. Spencer. Shawn. (fist bumps with SHAWN on way out)

BILL:
(gives SHAWN a few $20 bills) Now, you look after Burton for us.

SHAWN:
Oh! Are you sure this is enough? I mean, this is Gus we're talking about, right?

BILL gives SHAWN some more money.

SHAWN:
Don't worry, Mr. G, I got it covered.

WINNIE:
Merry Christmas, Shawn. (leaves)

SHAWN:
Merry Christmas to you all. (waves)

BILL:
Merry Christmas. (leaves)

HENRY:
Bye, guys!

BILL:
Goodbye.

HENRY:
All right, all right, all right. How did you do it? Come on.

SHAWN raises a hand to his head and HENRY grabs it. SHAWN smiles.

HENRY:
Don't. Don't. Don't. (points at SHAWN)

Episode 2x11 There's Something About Mira

1987

INT. RESTAURANT, NIGHT

HENRY has taken SHAWN and GUS out to dinner at a fancy restaurant.

HENRY:
Come on, boys. (snaps fingers) Sit up, sit up. Come on, napkins in lap. Now, listen, we don't get to go out very often, so I want you to order something special. Harbor Grill is one of the nicest restaurants in Santa Barbara.

GUS:
I'm gonna have nachos.

SHAWN:
No way. (sees MAN drop something in woman's champagne glass) Dad, I think that guy over there is a spy. And he's trying to poison her!

The couple clink their glasses and sip. The MAN watches over the rim of his glass as the WOMAN looks into her glass. She reaches in with a knife and pulls out a ring as the MAN kneels in front of her. SHAWN leans forward.

MAN:
I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna say it. (slips the ring on her finger) Megan, will you marry me?

MEGAN:
(breathless) Y-yes! Of course, yes! (kisses him)

Everyone in the restaurant applauds.

HENRY:
Come on, guys, you've seen people propose before. It's a very special moment. Especially for a man. You fall in love with a woman. You decide you're gonna spend the rest of your life with her.

SHAWN:
Rest of my life with a girl? No way!

GUS:
I'm never ever gonna get married!

SHAWN watches as one of the waitresses walks past in a short skirt and the MAN eyes her as she bends over.

SHAWN:
By the way, they're not gonna make it.

PRESENT DAY

EXT. PARK, BATTING CAGES, DAY

SHAWN is leaning against the outside of the cage as GUS takes a wild swing at the ball as it comes at him. With a cry, his swing actually spins him around. He misses the ball.

SHAWN:
Do I need to set this on slow pitch?

GUS turns around to glare at him. He sees a MAN leaning against a post reading a newspaper.

GUS:
Hey. I swore I saw that guy earlier.

SHAWN:
Yeah, He's been following us all day. I'd say worst P.I, ever. Check this out.

SHAWN enters the batting cage and shows GUS the photos he took on his cell phone.

GUS:
What the... No. He followed me into the bathroom? That's my sanctuary.

SHAWN:
I know.

GUS:
All right, we gotta find out what he wants. And we have to do it in a way that's cool and clever.

SHAWN:
(puts away phone) I got it. (picks up a ball from the ground and throws it at the MAN) Gyro ball!

The ball hits the post instead of the MAN, bouncing off.

MAN 2:
Hey, watch it!

GUS:
(gives bat to SHAWN) Let me show you how it's done. Watch out. (picks up a ball, does a small preparation "dance" and throws the ball. The ball hits the cage, never leaving the confines)

SHAWN:
That very well may be the most humiliating moment of your life. (gives bat back to GUS and picks up another ball) I pitch better from the stretch. (throws but it hits a garbage can)

The MAN unfolds himself from the post as SHAWN and GUS exit the batting cage.

MAN:
That's enough. (unwraps a fresh pack of cigarettes)

A ball hits the MAN in the chest.

MAN:
Hey! Ow! (puts a hand to his chest)

GUS:
And that was for following me into the bathroom!

MAN:
Okay, so you figured out I was following you. My name is Mace Rhoden. I'm a private investigator.

SHAWN:
If I might give you a little criticism. I don't think you've quite mastered the private part. Of course, if you're going for most obvious detective... (sing-song) Nailed it.

GUS:
What do you want from us?

RHODEN:
I was hired to find you. By your wife.

SHAWN:
(snickers) One more tiny piece of criticism. You haven't mastered the investigative part either. Neither of us are married.

GUS:
Uh, Shawn? Can I talk to you for a minute? (pulls SHAWN away from RHODEN)

SHAWN:
(laughs) This guy! Talkin' about one of us being married. Can you even imagine that? Why aren't you laughing? Why aren't you laughing? Oh, my God! You were married?

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is looking through an old notebook as GUS stands beside him.

SHAWN:
I can't believe you were married! The bachelor party is tainted. (flips page in anger) I didn't get to give my brilliant speech I've been planning since we were seventh graders.

GUS:
You have not.

SHAWN presses the notebook against GUS' chest as he walks over to his desk. GUS looks at the notebook.

GUS:
You have a book of speeches?

SHAWN:
(sits at desk) I wrote those a long time ago.

GUS:
You already wrote my eulogy?

SHAWN:
I don't remember that.

GUS:
(walks over to SHAWN) "Gus is survived by his best friend Shawn Spencer and 12 cats."

SHAWN:
Look, the speeches are not the point, Gus. The point is, why didn't you tell me you were married?

GUS:
I didn't tell anyone. I was embarrassed. Look, I'm sorry. I was wrong for not telling you. But, dude, you know when I get married for real you'll be standing up there on that altar, right next to me, as my best man.

SHAWN:
Thank you for saying that. I needed to hear it.

GUS:
You're welcome.

SHAWN:
So who is this harlot?

GUS:
It was spring break '97. I was in Mazatlan with some college friends.

SHAWN:
'97? Tell me you weren't still rockin' the sweater vest.

GUS:
What? No. Her name was Mira Gaffney.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK MAZATLAN, 1997

INT. TIKI BAR, NIGHT

GUS is wearing khaki shorts, yellow golf shirt and an argyle sweater vest. He's dancing to the music, a beer in his hand.

GUS: (v.o.)
I'll never forget the first time I saw her.

MIRA is dancing behind the bar in a bikini. She drinks a mouthful of alcohol and spits it out as the barman holds a lighter to it, turning it to flame.

GUS: (v.o.)
Mira was like no other girl I ever dated. She could get me to do things no one else could ever do.

>>> LATER >>>

GUS is sitting on one of the bar stools and MIRA is leaning against the one in front of him.

MIRA:
So, seriously, you've never been skydiving?

GUS:
Well, I really don't like planes. Or heights. Or jumpsuits.

They giggle.

MIRA:
No, you like sweater vests.

GUS:
I do.

MIRA:
So you're a sky-diving virgin? Yeah! I'm gonna take you! We'll go! It's amazing! You're gonna love it! (she climbs onto the stool in front of GUS and kisses him deeply)

SHAWN: (v.o.)
Okay. Dude, skydiving's one thing, but how did she get you to marry her?

GUS: (v.o.)
Three words. Three little words.

MIRA:
(ends kiss) Let's try Goldschlager!

GUS: (v.o.)
And four hours later...

INT. CHAPEL, NIGHT

The ceremony is performed by a local man in a serape and sombrero. An older woman is there as a witness. MIRA jumps into GUS' arms. They all turn to face the camera - including a goat.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is holding the wedding photo.

SHAWN:
Oh, my God. And your best man was a goat? I was supposed to be that goat!

GUS:
Shawn, we're on me now.

SHAWN:
You're right. I'm, I'm sorry.

GUS:
(yanks photo out of SHAWN'S hands) Man, I haven't thought about her in so long. People used to call her Hurricane Mira because she was this wild, beautiful, insane girl.

SHAWN:
So who broke it off?

GUS:
Me. And it got weird real quick. (sits at desk) She called me, like, 100 times in one day. And threatened to burn down my apartment.

SHAWN:
Mira really has a thing for fire, huh?

GUS:
But there's something about her. It just stuck with me. I have never felt that way about any other woman.

SHAWN:
All right, that's it. I need to meet this trollop.

GUS:
You wanna come with me?

SHAWN:
(holds arms out to his sides) Yeah!

GUS:
You bet. (stands) But, dude, listen, I don't know if I can control myself around her, so you have to promise that you'll stop me from being sucked into hurricane Mira again.

SHAWN:
Just call me the suck-stopper. Scratch that. Don't, don't ever call me that.

GUS:
I wonder why she wants to see me. (walks away)

SHAWN:
I don't know. Maybe she wants to introduce you to little Gus Jr. (a soft ball is thrown at his head) Or not.

EXT. STREET MARKET, DAY

A man runs through the stalls chased by the police.

LASSITER:
Hold it! SBPD! I said stop!

The man jumps over a table laden with fruit and flips it over.

LASSITER:
Hold it!

JULIET:
Look out! Look out!

LASSITER clambers over the table but trips and falls.

LASSITER:
Son of a...

BUZZ helps him up. JULIET stops, looks around and then takes off in a different direction. The others keep chasing the man who jumps over a chain-link fence.

LASSITER:
I said freeze! SBPD!

JULIET comes around and grabs the man and knocks him to the ground. She then picks him up and shoves him against the fence.

JULIET:
You have the right to remain silent. (cuffs him)

LASSITER, BUZZ and the other officers watch in astonishment.

LASSITER:
O'Hara, how did you just...

JULIET:
Just had a hunch he lived in the area. I figured he'd try to lose us by hopping one of the fences between Hope Street and the 101. Let's go. (pulls the man away from the fence and walks him back)

BUZZ:
I'm impressed.

LASSITER:
Shut up.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER follows JULIET as she hands over custody of her prisoner.

LASSITER:
Come on, O'Hara, level with me. That was really just a hunch?

JULIET:
Yes, for the tenth time.

They walk over to the main desk. Behind them BUZZ leans over to talk with the officer behind the desk.

LASSITER:
Did he, like, drop his wallet or a piece of mail with his address on it? Have you been to his house before?

JULIET:
Why would I have been to his house?

LASSITER:
I don't know. You date.

JULIET:
I just happen to be good at deductive reasoning.

BUZZ:
You know, I've been studying for the detective's exam, and the deductive reasoning part is just killing me. Maybe you could tutor me some time?

JULIET:
Sure. Okay.

LASSITER:
(puts a hand on BUZZ'S shoulder) You know, if anyone's gonna tutor you, it should be me. After all, I do hold the department record for the highest score on the detective's exam. 97.2.

BUZZ and JULIET look away, not wanting to meet his eyes.

LASSITER:
What?

BUZZ:
I have to go wash out the, drunk tank. (leaves)

JULIET:
Yeah! (walks to her desk)

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER follows JULIET.

LASSITER:
What, did someone beat my score?

VICK:
(walks up to them) Hey. I heard about the collar. Nice work. Another case closed.

LASSITER:
Chief.

VICK:
Yeah?

LASSITER:
Did someone score higher than me on the detective's exam?

VICK:
I believe O'Hara did. (enters office)

LASSITER:
O'Hara?

JULIET:
Hmm.

LASSITER:
(plasters on a fake smile) You beat my score!

JULIET:
Only by a little.

LASSITER:
How much?

JULIET:
98.4.

LASSITER:
(whistles) Gosh, you know, I check all those scores every three months. How come I didn't know about this? (sits on the edge of her desk)

JULIET:
Well, because I made detective when I was in Miami so you wouldn't see those results. And I didn't wanna tell you because I know how much you hate to lose.

LASSITER:
I do not hate to lose.

JULIET:
Look, we both did well on the exam. And those scores don't matter to me. What matters to me is that I respect you as a cop and as a friend, and I really, really hope this doesn't become a thing between us.

LASSITER:
This is not gonna become a thing between us. (stands and walks away)

EXT. WINERY, DAY

SHAWN and GUS mingle during an outside wine tasting.

GUS:
That Mace guy said this was the place to meet her.

SHAWN:
Maybe she works here.

GUS:
That wouldn't surprise me. She's had, like, a thousand jobs.

SHAWN:
There's nothing wrong with that. And she doesn't just work here. (picks up a bottle from a display) The wine is named Mira.

GUS:
Maybe they name a wine after all their employees.

SHAWN:
Remind me to grab a bottle of Leonard on the way out. (puts bottle back)

MIRA:
Burton Guster?

SHAWN and GUS turn around and see MIRA sashay down the stairs, hands on hips. GUS is lost.

SHAWN:
Gus? Gus? Gus!

GUS:
(turns to SHAWN) What do I say? How's my breath?

GUS breathes on SHAWN, who puts his hand up to block.

SHAWN:
Relax. Remember the plan.

GUS:
What plan? I forgot the plan.

MIRA squeals when she reaches them and leaps at GUS, spinning him in a hug.

MIRA:
How are you? I haven't seen you in what? Ten years? And now look, boom, here you are.

GUS looks like he wants to talk but all he can do is bob his head.

SHAWN:
(holds his hand out to MIRA) Hi, I'm Shawn.

MIRA:
Hi. (shakes SHAWN'S hand)

SHAWN:
I, I gave him a really tough riddle on the way over, so he's probably now just figuring out that the doctor was a woman.

MIRA:
No, no. He's done this before. He did this when we first met. I think it's kinda cute actually. If we just keep talking, he'll catch up. So I hear that you guys have a detective agency or something.

GUS:
Mira! Mira! Hi.

MIRA:
Hi there. Welcome.

GUS:
Wow! You look amazing.

MIRA:
No, you do.

GUS:
No, you really look amazing.

MIRA:
No, you do.

GUS:
A little bit, but, I mean!

MIRA:
(takes GUS by the arm and walks with him) The only thing that would have been better was if you had worn one of those sweater vests. I love that you used to wear those sweater vests?

MIRA and GUS laugh. SHAWN catches up to them.

SHAWN:
Gus, I remember the plan. This isn't it.

MIRA:
I know. Let's celebrate with a drink. Okay? But not Goldschlager, right? (hurries over a table with wine)

GUS:
I'm in trouble.

SHAWN:
All right, just be cool. And make your armpits stop sweating.

MIRA:
Okay, so this is our Sangiovese from last year. (hands them each a glass of wine)

GUS:
(laughs) Goldschlager!

MIRA:
(laughs) Gus.

SHAWN:
So how long have you been working here?

MIRA:
No, no, no. This is my family's place. We have three wineries. This one, a new one in Napa, and then there's the one in Spain. Which of course I can't go to because I punched a bull in Pamplona.

GUS:
So, Mira, what made you wanna see me after all this time?

MIRA:
Well, I kinda have some big news.

GUS:
Is it Gus Jr.?

SHAWN looks at him.

MIRA:
What?

GUS:
Nothing. (glares at SHAWN)

MIRA:
I'm getting married.

SHAWN:
Oh.

GUS:
Oh.

MIRA:
Yeah, yeah. His name is Jann, and he's from Sweden, although he's lived all over the world. And I met him at this wine convention a few months ago and...

SHAWN:
Mira, that's awesome. Congratulations.

MIRA:
Thanks. So the thing is, Gus, that, our wedding chapel in Mazatlan, they actually sent the marriage license to the U.S the annulment isn't official. So I kinda just need you to fill out some paperwork. Is that cool?

SHAWN:
Yes!

GUS:
Oh, sure. Okay, sure.

MIRA:
Okay, good. Good. I was a little worried.

SHAWN:
So when is the big day?

MIRA:
It's actually tomorrow. On Ledbetter Beach. It's just gonna be a small thing. I kinda wanted it to be here, but he wanted at a beach, it's really the only thing he really wants, so I think I'll let him do it. It's kinda romantic and... Oh! Dad! (runs over to her father DAVID)

DAVID:
Yes?

MIRA:
(pulls him over by the arm) Dad, this is Shawn. It's Shawn, right? Yeah, Shawn. And this is Gus.

GUS holds out his hand but DAVID ignores it.

DAVID:
Oh, yes. Guster, huh? So this is the young man that tricked you into marrying him, huh?

MIRA:
Yeah.

DAVID:
Typical. Mira, I need to speak to you.

MIRA:
Okay.

DAVID:
Gentlemen, only the first glass is free. (walks away)

MIRA:
Oh, why don't you come to the wedding?

SHAWN:
Oh, Mira.

MIRA:
Please? (jumps up and down) Please, please, please! Come, come, come, come, come, come!

SHAWN:
That's very sweet of you, but we're...

GUS:
What time should we be there?

SHAWN:
Gus.

GUS:
Shawn, what is wrong with you? Mira, of course we will come.

MIRA:
Okay, good. So I'm gonna go get the wedding info and the annulment papers. I hope I don't ever say that sentence again. (runs off)

SHAWN:
Dude...

GUS:
She just smelled so nice. Don't judge me, Shawn. I'm weak. (walks away)

EXT. LEADBETTER BEACH, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk through the picnic area at the beach. GUS is wearing a tan suit with a blue shirt and tie. SHAWN is wearing tan pants, Converse sneakers and an un-tucked long-sleeved blue shirt.

GUS:
I can't believe late.

SHAWN:
Look, I'm not the one that spent two hours picking out the perfect shirt-tie-eyes combo.

HENRY:
Finally. What the hell am I doing here? Shawn, you cancelled twice, you're late. I'm hungry.

HENRY is wearing shorts, flips-flops and a Hawaiian shirt.

SHAWN:
Look, we're gonna eat lunch. I promise. There may even be a grilled cheese bar and some dancing involved.

HENRY:
What, at The Crab Shack?

SHAWN:
Change of plans. We're going to a wedding.

HENRY:
(looks down at his clothes) I can't go to a wedding. I'm not dressed for a wedding.

SHAWN:
Dad, you look sharp as a tack. (gets elbowed by GUS) No one will even notice. (walks away)

HENRY:
Shawn. Shawn. Shawn?

The three arrive at the small area set for the wedding. Behind the setting for the ceremony is a tent for the reception. A woman hurries over to them.

WOMAN:
Hey! Hi, hi, hi! (shakes GUS' hand) Hi.

GUS:
Hi.

WOMAN:
(shakes SHAWN'S hand) Hi, I'm Stacy. I'm Mira's friend. (looks at HENRY) Is he with you?

SHAWN:
Yeah he's fine. I just won him in a bet.

STACY:
I know who you are.

GUS:
You do?

STACY:
You're Gus! Gus! (shakes him gently) We've been waiting for you. Mira said we couldn't start until you got here. After all, you are a very special guest.

GUS:
I am?

STACY:
Don't be nervous, you. You'll do great. Your spot's just right up front there. Lucky. Now get up there!

GUS:
Okay.

STACY:
Your little tie... (cuts between them and heads for the tent) He's here!

MIRA peeks around the tent flap and waves. GUS waves back nervously. SHAWN, GUS and HENRY turn around to face the ceremony. Violin music starts and the guests turn around to watch for the bride.

GUS:
Oh, my God. This is my wedding.

SHAWN:
Gus, that's crazy.

GUS:
No, it's not. (grabs SHAWN by the arm and turns him around) It's Mira. It's just like her to try to pull something like this. You gotta get me outta here.

SHAWN:
Okay, relax. I can have you in Mexico in four hours. But we gotta dye your hair, change your name and cut off your fingertips so you can't be identified.

GUS:
I don't need fingertips.

MIRA'S mother PHYLLIS stands up in front of everyone. GUS hides behind SHAWN.

PHYLLIS:
Excuse me, everyone. I'm afraid we have horrible news. It seems Jann is missing.

SHAWN:
(punches the air) Yes!

GUS:
Whoo! Oh, that was close!

SHAWN:
Sweet!

Everyone stares at them.

INT. RECEPTION TENT, DAY

MIRA sits at one of the tables, wailing inconsolably. PHYLLIS tries to comfort her as STACY brings her a glass of water.

PHYLLIS:
Mira, sweetheart, it's...

MIRA:
No, I don't want the water. (puts the glass down on a nearby table)

SHAWN and GUS sit at a table near the buffet. HENRY starts eating a chicken leg.

PHYLLIS:
Baby, it's been two hours. I don't think he's coming.

MIRA:
What do you...

DAVID:
Of course he's not coming. He didn't show up Wednesday for golf, Thursday for the barbecue, yesterday for the rehearsal dinner. Why would he show up to his own wedding?

MIRA:
No, Dad, you know that he got called to work on those other things.

DAVID:
I can't believe you talked me into this.

PHYLLIS:
Baby, can we at least let the people eat something?

MIRA:
No. Nobody gets to eat until I'm married!

MIRA points at HENRY and everyone looks at him.

HENRY:
(with mouth full) That's it, Shawn. I'm outta here. It's rude to invite people to an event and not feed 'em. (leaves)

MIRA:
Somebody fix it!

GUS:
Look at her in that dress. She's so beautiful.

SHAWN:
Dude, I gotta get you outta here. (stands)

GUS:
This must be how she felt after I annulled our wedding. I feel so bad for her.

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. (pats GUS on the shoulder) Come on, let's hit it. (starts to leave)

GUS gets up and walks over to MIRA.

SHAWN:
What? (follows GUS)

GUS:
Mira.

MIRA:
Yeah?

GUS:
I am so sorry to hear about Jann. We'll help you find him.

MIRA:
You will?

SHAWN:
We will?

GUS:
Yes, we don't have any cases right now. We're more than happy to help.

MIRA:
Oh, Guster! (hugs him) Thank you!

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is at her desk when LASSITER stops and puts down a folder in front of her.

LASSITER:
Just finished my case reports for the week, spell-checked, copied, and collated, time to spare.

JULIET:
Good for you.

LASSITER:
Exactly. O'Hara, I do hope you're not falling behind on your paperwork.

VICK:
(walks over from her office) Those reports look great, O'Hara. Listen, can you translate these files into Spanish? (hands her a folder)

JULIET:
No problema.

VICK heads back to her office as JULIET gets up and walks over to the coffee.

LASSITER:
You speak Spanish?

JULIET:
It's a requirement in Miami. (pours a cup)

LASSITER:
(joins her at the coffee) Well, there's not that very large a Latino population here in Santa Barbara. (looks down and pours coffee)

JULIET takes a sip of coffee and has to set the cup down quickly.

JULIET:
That's so hot! Matt! Did you just brew this?

LASSITER guzzles down his coffee and presses his lips together as he obviously hides the pain.

LASSITER:
It's not too hot for me.

JULIET:
Please tell me you didn't just burn your mouth because you're still pissed I scored higher than you on that stupid exam?

LASSITER:
No.

BUZZ:
Hey, Detective O'Hara! Your stolen refrigeration truck from the seafood warehouse, that's a 10851, right?

JULIET:
Yes.

BUZZ writes on his palm.

LASSITER:
No, hold on. That truck is a commercial vehicle, so technically it's a 15250.

JULIET:
Excuse me, detective. He was asking me. Now, if that vehicle ends up in a chop shop, it's a 10803.

BUZZ tries to keep up as he continues to write on his hand.

LASSITER:
Of course if there's reckless driving involved, it's a 23001. Watch out for the illegal transportation of hazardous materials. 25001.

JULIET:
Okay, that's enough.

BUZZ:
I gotta go get some paper anyway. (leaves)

JULIET:
You know what?

LASSITER:
What?

JULIET:
I have worked hard. I have done everything asked of me. I am a good cop, and I'm not going to stand here and apologize for my good score. So you are just gonna have to get over it.

LASSITER:
Yeah. I can't do that.

JULIET:
Well then, now what?

LASSITER:
Your truck. Whoever solves that case is the better detective.

JULIET:
Solve your own cases. It's a refrigeration truck. It's practically a victimless crime.

LASSITER:
I guess you just don't count the people who aren't gonna get their lobster and sand dabs as victims. I'm surprised the Miami P.D. didn't fail you for lack of compassion.

As LASSITER walks away, JULIET rolls her eyes with a groan.

EXT. WINERY, DAY

GUS and MIRA are sitting at a table overlooking the vineyard.

MIRA:
Gus, what's wrong with me? What is it that makes all the guys go crazy on me?

GUS:
Jann was an idiot for giving you up.

MIRA:
You're so sweet. Sweet. Sweet Gus.

GUS and MIRA look into each other's eyes.

SHAWN:
Yeah, he's pretty sweet all right. (is sitting at the other end of the table making a cabin out of corks) His head is like a chocolate-covered honeydew. Now, would anyone like to talk about Jan?

GUS:
It's Jann, with a "J".

MIRA:
Shawn is right. We should do that. So this is all that I have. (dumps contents of purse onto the table) I have some pictures of us together. And a note that he wrote me. And a lipstick from him.

SHAWN looks at a couple of pictures of MIRA and JANN. One of them is the couple on a ski vacation and the other is at a beach. In both of them, JANN has the same nick on his chin.

SHAWN:
Do you have any more pictures?

MIRA:
No.

SHAWN then notices a prescription for Clozapine with an refill date of 1/3/08.

GUS:
Shawn, shouldn't you maybe go talk with Mira's parents? (walks over and pulls SHAWN up) I'll find you when we're finished.

SHAWN:
I haven't finished my...

GUS:
It's fine. I'll finish it. (pushes him away)

SHAWN:
You don't even know how to work with cork!

SHAWN walks down a covered walkway and spots PHYLLIS talking with guests. He then looks beyond them and sees a man scrubbing yellow paint off a wall. The guests end their conversation and PHYLLIS turns back and SHAWN approaches her.

SHAWN:
Mrs. Gaffney, hello. My name is Shawn Spencer.

PHYLLIS:
Oh, I know who you are. You're the psychic detective helping Mira. You know, I've always been fascinated by people with "the gift."

They walk together back the way SHAWN came.

SHAWN:
Uh, you're talking about this? (motions to his face and hair) Well, that takes work. I'd like to ask you a question about Jan.

PHYLLIS:
Jann? I wouldn't know the first thing about him.

SHAWN:
I see. Because you haven't met him?

PHYLLIS:
Very good.

INT. WINERY, CELLAR, DAY

PHYLLIS opens the large wooden door and precedes SHAWN into a room with loaded wine racks, casks and boxes.

PHYLLIS:
This is our private wine and alcohol collection.

SHAWN:
Oh, I see. I have a private room for all of my Hello Kitty shot glasses and wild animal scat. I have many interests.

PHYLLIS:
(takes two glasses over to a table) Well, only a privileged few are allowed down here. The wine in this room is worth over $1 million. (pours some wine into the glasses) We've been collecting it for years from all over the world. Would you like a glass? (hands one to SHAWN)

SHAWN:
(takes glass) Actually, I prefer my wine in a box.

SHAWN watches as PHYLLIS drinks her wine down in one go.

SHAWN:
Wow. I've often heard that's the best way to savor wine. Just skip over the taste buds and go right to the gullet.

PHYLLIS:
(pours another glass) I swear, if I have to deal with another tourist today, my head is going to explode. And David doesn't like me drinking in front of the guests. (sips wine)

SHAWN:
So, uh, how did you manage to never meet Jan?

PHYLLIS:
We tried to. Several times. Take a sip before I finish the bottle.

SHAWN:
(takes a sip and spits it right out)That's... That's disgusting.

PHYLLIS:
That's a $30,000 bottle of Spanish sherry.

SHAWN:
(forces down another sip) It's good.

PHYLLIS:
(walks around to stand beside SHAWN) You know, Shawn, I have very fine taste, and I like my wine like I like my men... White and hairy.

SHAWN:
That doesn't make any sense. None whatsoever. But I can see where Mira gets her spunkiness.

The door opens and DAVID enters. PHYLLIS steps away from SHAWN and puts down her glass.

DAVID:
Phyllis, some of our guests have gone out... What's going on here?

PHYLLIS:
I was just explaining our frustration over never meeting Jann.

DAVID:
Yeah, that guy. (walks in and sets rolled up paper on table) Yeah, every time we made plans, he would change them at the last second with that same lame excuse about having to work overseas. (picks up a bottle)I cannot believe that I shut down my winery for this wedding. I should have known better.

As DAVID talks, SHAWN sees a shipping notice for the new winery in Napa and that the rolled paper are plans for a showroom.

DAVID:
(makes a note on a clipboard) Mira's choices in men have always been suspect. Including that Guster and his supposedly psychic friend. Now if you'll excuse us? (walks over to PHYLLIS)

SHAWN:
Yes, of course. You have to finish packing your wine. You're moving into your winery in Napa on Friday, and your amazing collection will finally be on display for all to see.

DAVID:
Wait a minute. How'd you know that...

SHAWN:
Don't be intimidated, sir. I'm just a man. (sips the sherry and gags) Oh, God. (leaves)

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

They are sitting at GUS' desk.

SHAWN:
Brace yourself, Jan doesn't actually exist.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Fact. There is no record of a Jan Anglund, buyer of fine wines and food, on the internet anywhere. I did find a Jeff Anglund. He's an albino with a website dedicated to Short Circuit.

GUS:
You put us on the email list?

SHAWN:
That's a given.

GUS:
Nice! Oh, so she was lying?

SHAWN:
Or she really is checking into the nutcracker suite. Hear me. Mira made Jan up. (slaps his hands down on GUS' desk and pushes chair back towards his desk)

GUS:
She made him up?

SHAWN:
What is... (looks at notes) Clozapine?

GUS:
It's an anti-anxiety drug. It's also used to treat psychosis.

SHAWN:
Bingo. Mira had a prescription to Clozapine. But the refill date was from way back when, and she had a bunch of pills left.

GUS:
So she was off her meds.

SHAWN:
And off her rocker. Even more so than her mother.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Let's just say I know where Mira gets her freaky side.

GUS:
I can't believe this. (stands and walks to the front of his desk)I was feeling bad for Mira. I even started to... (stops) Oh, my gosh! Shawn, she did all this to get me back. I fell for it again.

SHAWN:
But wait, there's more. The pictures.

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

MIRA is standing on one side of the table with her parents while GUS stands on the other. SHAWN stands between them, waving his hand over the pictures on the table. VICK, LASSITER and JULIET stand in the background, watching the proceedings.

SHAWN:
I sense something is very, very, very wrong about these photos, very wrong indeed. (looks at MIRA) Jan Anglund doesn't exist. Thank you and good night. (heads for the door)

MIRA:
Wait, wait, wait a minute! Jan... Jann is real. Why would I make any of this up?

While still looking at MIRA, SHAWN points to GUS.

GUS:
To trick me into falling for you again. I can't believe you'd go through all of this just to get me back.

VICK:
How sure are you about this theory?

SHAWN:
(looks at VICK) Crystal. That doesn't really work. Very, very sure.

VICK:
Mmm-hmm. Then how do you explain him? (points to the hall)

Standing in the doorway is a tall handsome man looking a little nervous.

MIRA:
Jann! (runs to him)

JANN:
Mira!

LASSITER smiles smugly.

JANN:
Honey, I'm so sorry.

The couple hugs in the hallway as SHAWN, GUS, VICK, LASSITER and JULIET watch from the office.

SHAWN:
(turns around) I'm gonna grab a Clark Bar from the vending machine. Uh, anyone else want anything? Chief? Jules? Gus, you're good?

GUS shakes his head.

SHAWN:
Okay.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

JANN and MIRA kiss as the others watch.

JANN:
Honey, I looked for you at the winery, but they said you were here.

MIRA:
Where were you?

JANN:
You didn't get my message?

MIRA:
What message?

JANN:
At the hotel desk. Uh, look, I got a call to close this deal with these venture capitalists in Portugal. It was for a very important client, and I thought I could get back in time.

SHAWN:
(leans over and whispers to GUS) Venture capitalists? Really?

GUS elbows SHAWN in the stomach.

JANN:
I'm so sorry. I never should have gone. I missed our big day.

MIRA:
I'm just glad you're okay.

GUS watches sadly.

DAVID:
Why don't we talk about this back at the winery and spend some time getting to know you.

MIRA:
Yeah.

JANN:
Sure.

MIRA:
Just give me one second.

JANN:
All right.

JANN walks out with DAVID and PHYLLIS. MIRA walks over to GUS and SHAWN and points a finger at them.

MIRA:
You both, I don't even know what to say to you. How could you be so cruel? (storms away)

LASSITER:
(puts an arm around SHAWN'S shoulders) Doesn't exist, huh? That's great. Hey, should I put out an imaginary APB for him on my invisible radio?

SHAWN mimics LASSITER.

JULIET:
I have a case to work. (walks away)

LASSITER:
So do I. (walks in opposite direction)

GUS:
Damn it, Shawn. You made me look like a fool in front of Mira.

SHAWN:
Dude, you know deep, deep down that there is something weird going on here. With Mira, with Jan suddenly appearing out of nowhere. I'm gonna prove it to you. I'm gonna show you that something's going on.

GUS:
No. No more, Shawn. Stop it. I'm serious about this.

SHAWN:
Fine. For you, I'll stop. (walks away)

GUS:
Thank you.

INT. HOTEL, HALL, DAY

SHAWN knocks on the door of JANN'S room but MIRA answers.

MIRA:
What are you doing here?

SHAWN:
Well, I was hoping to speak with Jan for a minute.

MIRA:
Jann.

SHAWN:
I won't call him that.

MIRA:
Yeah, he's off playing golf with my father. (starts to shut the door)

SHAWN:
Ah, sweet.

MIRA:
Is that it? 'Cause I'm busy.

SHAWN:
Actually, there is one more thing. (looks down the hall) Just between you and me, why'd you fake those pictures of you and Jan? I may have been wrong about a couple of things, but I know for a fact that those pictures are fakes. Jan had a shaving cut in the same place on his neck in each one of these pictures even though they were taken at different times of the year.

MIRA:
It's Gus' fault, really. Ever since what happened between he and I, my parents have been skeptical of every guy I've been with. Andy, Amir, Guru Anupam, Gay Andy, Anthony...

SHAWN:
Does Gay Andy know you call him that?

MIRA:
He gave himself that name. Look, Jann and I had only been together for a few weeks when we decided to get married, and I know that's crazy, but I just believe in all or nothing. You know, doing what feels right. Are you following me, Shawn?

SHAWN:
What, are you kidding me? I spent an entire season with an interpretive dance group in Buffalo.

MIRA:
But, see, my parents were against this thing from the whole beginning. So Jann photoshopped some pictures to make it look like we had been together for longer than we had, and it worked.

SHAWN:
Wait a second. You're saying the pictures were Jan's idea?

MIRA:
No. Jann. And yeah, he's the one with the super-fast printer.

A phone rings.

MIRA:
I gotta get that.

SHAWN:
No, no. That's coming from the room next door.

MIRA closes the door.

SHAWN:
Mira, Mira, Mira!

EXT. GOLF COURSE, DAY

SHAWN - wearing a pink golf shirt and long shorts - drives the cart. GUS - wearing a cap, orange golf shirt and khakis - looks less than happy to be there.

SHAWN:
I said I was sorry about what happened with Mira. I am trying to make it up to you here. Come on, man, we haven't played golf in forever. This is gonna be fun. (gets out of the cart followed by GUS) Plus, I promise to keep my Caddyshack references to a minimum. (takes a club from his bag and walks to the tee) Now, I've heard this club is restricted, so, uh, don't tell 'em you're Jewish.

GUS:
(bends over to put down a ball) Shawn.

SHAWN:
I didn't say I wouldn't make any.

GUS puts his wooden tee into the ground.

SHAWN:
What are you doing? The lady's tee's up there.

GUS does a little dance, alternating stepping his feet to the tee. He bends over, preparing to swing. Behind him, SHAWN sees DAVID and JANN approaching in a cart. GUS makes his backswing.

SHAWN:
Dude! You know what would be more fun? (takes GUS' club) Starting on the back nine. (walks to the cart)

GUS:
Why can't we just start from here?

>>> LATER >>>

SHAWN and GUS have moved to another hole and GUS is measuring the distance with his club.

GUS:
I can par this hole with this putt.

As GUS stands and prepares to make his shot, SHAWN watches JANN through binoculars. He spots JANN on his mobile walking from the club house. He starts walking towards JANN as GUS makes his shot.

GUS:
Yes, yes, yes.

SHAWN scoops up the ball right before it drops into the hole.

SHAWN:
Great shot. Let's go. (keeps walking)

GUS:
Shawn! Shawn, get back here before I add two strokes to your score! (goes after SHAWN)

GUS comes up behind SHAWN as he peers around a tree watching JANN.

GUS:
What's the matter with you?

SHAWN:
Shh.

GUS:
Is this the real reason you brought me golfing? To follow Jann? I told you to drop it. He's back. There's no more case.

SHAWN:
Dude, you're wrong. Jan is the case. He's the key.

GUS:
You're losing it. (starts to walk away)

SHAWN keeps watching and sees RHODEN come out and join JANN, arguing with him.

RHODEN:
What the hell do you think you're doing here?

SHAWN:
Gus! Gus! That's the PI from the batting cages. Even you have to admit this is getting weird.

RHODEN leaves and JANN starts walking in their direction.

SHAWN:
Act natural.

SHAWN leans against a tree and GUS rests his club over his shoulder. JANN sees them.

JANN:
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

SHAWN:
(walks over to JANN) What's up? Just playing a little golf. Keeping an eye out for suspicious meetings between shady people.

GUS:
What were you and Mace Rhoden arguing about?

JANN:
That was nothing. You know, I was the guy who hired him. I was late paying, so he was kind of upset.

SHAWN:
Maybe Mira didn't tell you, but I'm a psychic. And right now the spirits are screaming something in my head over and over and over again. They're saying, "so se prometer usar as penas."(?)(speaks Portugese)

JANN:
I don't understand.

SHAWN:
It's Portuguese for "only if you promise to keep your feathered headdress on". How can you possibly do business in Portugal and not speak a word of the language?

GUS:
Why did you really miss the wedding?

JANN:
Okay. I wasn't in Europe.

SHAWN:
Yes!

JANN:
Look, the truth is, I was in another relationship. I was in a bad situation. I had to end it before I could get married to Mira.

GUS:
You were cheating on Mira?

JANN:
No. All right? No. Not exactly, okay? It started before we even met. And I promise you, it's over now. I know that I haven't always been a good guy. But being with Mira, you know, it's changed me. I realize now that she's the only thing in my life that matters. And you may not believe me, but that is the truest thing I have ever said. Look, I'd better get back before Mira's dad despises me even more. (walks back to the clubhouse)

SHAWN and GUS watch him leave.

GUS:
Shawn, I've been there before when it comes to Mira. He's telling the truth.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but he's definitely lying.

GUS:
How can he be doing both?

SHAWN:
Trust me. As someone who has occasionally dealt with half-truths, Jan Brady is not telling us everything.

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, DAY

A MAN sits in the interrogation room as LASSITER and JULIET argue in the observation room.

LASSITER:
He's my informant. I'll get the information we need.

JULIET:
Carlton, this is my case. And besides, your tough-guy interrogation technique, it's not gonna work.

LASSITER:
Oh, and you think sweet and gentle's gonna get info from a guy like this? Please. All I need is 30 seconds. You could time me.

JULIET:
Fine, I'll play that game. And I will beat you at it.

LASSITER:
Fine.

JULIET:
McNab!

BUZZ enters the room.

LASSITER:
We're commandeering your watch.

BUZZ:
You're commandeering my...

LASSITER:
(holds out hand) Watch.

BUZZ:
Okay.

BUZZ unfastens his watch and gives it to LASSITER. The detective dismisses him with a nod and BUZZ leaves.

LASSITER:
Now watch how I break this guy. It's all in the eyes.

LASSITER tosses the watch to JULIET and leaves the room, closing the door behind him. JULIET starts the timer and watches through the window a few moments before running out.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER peers through the small window of the door. He slowly opens the door and stands there quietly glaring at the man as the door closes behind him. The man shrugs, waiting for LASSITER to talk.

LASSITER:
(leans forward and slams hands on the table) All right. You little son of a...

JULIET:
(runs in) Time!

LASSITER:
What? I just got started.

JULIET:
They're your rules.

LASSITER:
Crap. (takes the watch and leaves the room)

JULIET:
Hey.

MAN:
Hi.

JULIET:
You look hungry. (holds out a Clark Bar)

MAN:
(takes candy) Kind of. Thanks.

JULIET:
(sits at table) So, what can you tell me about a refrigeration truck that was stolen a few days ago?

MAN:
Refrigeration truck? (takes a bite)

JULIET:
Oh, come on. All I need's a name, Rusty. (laughs)

RUSTY:
I know about pretty much every car boosted in Santa Barbara, but nothing as pointless as stealing a refrigerator truck. Honest.

LASSITER watches from the window and bursts in as the timer beeps.

LASSITER:
Time!

JULIET scrunches up her face in disappointment, stands and walks to the door, taking the watch from LASSITER as she passes him. LASSITER grabs the candy bar from RUSTY and throws it away.

LASSITER:
All right. Cut the crap, Rusty. We both know that you are holding out on me.

RUSTY:
I was eating that candy bar.

LASSITER:
Well, the candy police aren't here today. It's just me, and I got at least 12 different charges I could pin on you. So you better start giving me some good information.

RUSTY:
I don't know. Look, there's only two reasons why anybody steals a car. To sell it or to use it. Since nobody's come down to my shop to sell me your precious little truck, they need it for something.

JULIET:
(runs in as timer beeps) Time!

LASSITER:
(to RUSTY) Don't you dare tell her a thing. (grabs the watch from JULIET)

JULIET:
Oh, that's great detective work. Probably why you scored a whole point lower than me on the exam.

BUZZ:
Sorry to interrupt, but the Chief needs you for an important case.

JULIET and LASSITER look at each other and then race from the room. BUZZ looks at RUSTY.

RUSTY:
They took my Clark Bar.

BUZZ:
They took my watch.

INT. HOTEL, HALL, DAY

GUS and SHAWN walk down the hall past police towards JULIET and LASSITER.

GUS:
What's going on?

JULIET:
It's about Mira's fianc√©.

SHAWN:
I knew it. The guy's a crook. (walks past LASSITER and JULIET) All right! Playtime's over, Jan! I've had a bad psychic vibe about you from the beginning.

INT. HOTEL, ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stride into the room.

SHAWN:
Why don't you go ahead and tell us what you've really been up to?

SHAWN stops when he sees JANN'S body lying on its stomach across a coffee table.

SHAWN:
Whenever you're ready, Jan. Jan?

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is standing between the desks and GUS is standing by the window.

SHAWN:
Let's do a loop.

SHAWN walks towards the window and GUS walks towards the desks.

GUS:
I knew Jann was bad news.

GUS and SHAWN trade places again, walking the office in a loop.

SHAWN:
(sarcastic) Wow, Gus, you were so right. Why didn't I listen to you?

GUS:
We need to find out who killed him.

SHAWN:
That's a good idea.

SHAWN remembers seeing plastic wrapping on the floor by JANN'S body. He then remembers RHODEN and his cigarette wrapping.

SHAWN:
(faces GUS) Dude, I have a theory. I don't think Jan and Mace were just arguing about money.

GUS:
What else were they arguing about?

SHAWN:
I don't know yet. But I want to talk to Lassie and Jules. Let's go. (starts for the door)

GUS:
Oh, yeah, um, I'm not gonna be able to make it. I'm going to go by the winery. Mira called. She was wondering if I would come by.

SHAWN:
Gus...

GUS:
I'll be fine, Shawn. I just wanna be there for her as a friend.

SHAWN:
All right.

GUS:
Cool.

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

JULIET, LASSITER and VICK are sitting at the table when SHAWN enters.

SHAWN:
Oh, good. You're all here. I'm having a psychic vision about Jan, and I have a theory about who may have killed him.

VICK:
Let's just take a step back, Mr. Spencer.

SHAWN takes a step backwards.

VICK:
What...

There is a knock on the other door and BUZZ enters the room.

BUZZ:
I just got the fingerprint results from the refrigerator truck case. Do you wanna take turns with this?

LASSITER grabs the file from BUZZ.

SHAWN:
Take turns? What's going on here?

JULIET grabs the file from LASSITER.

LASSITER:
O'Hara and I have a little competition. (takes file back) Excuse me.

VICK:
Competition?

JULIET:
It is not a competition. Lassiter is just being a child about his detective exam score.

SHAWN:
Oh yeah. The DET? I took that when I was 15. I got 100.

LASSITER:
I'm sorry. You said you got a perfect score?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

JULIET:
When you were 15?

SHAWN:
Yeah. Why? What did you guys get?

VICK doesn't say anything as JULIET and LASSITER look at each other. BUZZ is amused.

LASSITER:
You know, it's probably changed a lot since then. You really can't compare it.

JULIET:
Oh, apples and oranges.

EXT. WINERY, NIGHT

GUS and MIRA are walking along the paths.

MIRA:
He cheated on me, and then he lied to me about missing the wedding, and now he's dead.

GUS:
I know exactly how you feel.

MIRA:
Really?

GUS:
Well, no.

MIRA:
I always knew that there was something wrong with Jann. From the very beginning, there was a little voice inside me that said it was all wrong, but I didn't listen 'cause he had Andy's laugh and Gay Andy's sense of style, and your heart. At least that's what I thought.

GUS leans in for a kiss and there's a loud crash from inside.

GUS:
What was that?

MIRA:
I don't know, but my parents are gone and the vineyard's closed.

INT. WINERY, CELLAR, NIGHT

MIRA and GUS walk slowly to the open door of the collection. Outside is a broken crate with smashed bottles. Inside, crates have been opened and searched.

GUS:
Somebody's been in here.

MIRA:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think maybe we should call the police.

GUS:
Good idea.

GUS hits speed dial and raises the phone to his ear. A gun is pointed to his head but he doesn't notice. MIRA turns around and gasps. It's only then that GUS sees the gun.

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, NIGHT

VICK:
Officer McNab, you were saying?

BUZZ:
Uh, yeah, the lab matched one of the prints from the gold lighter that was dropped when the truck was stolen to a known convict named Marcus Ridley, AKA Mike Ray, AKA...

SHAWN flashes on RHODEN with the lighter. He presses a hand to his eye and cries out.

SHAWN:
My eyes! It's burning! It's stinging! Stuff that old women carry in their purses!

JULIET:
Velamints!

SHAWN:
No, it's more of an aerosol.

JULIET:
Binaca!

SHAWN:
It's not a breath freshener!

JULIET:
Mace!

SHAWN:
Yes. (lowers hand)

BUZZ:
Mace Rhoden. That's right.

SHAWN remembers the man at the winery cleaning off the yellow paint.

SHAWN:
Was the truck yellow?

BUZZ:
Well, more like a mustard, but yeah.

SHAWN:
Oh, I'm getting another vision. Two, two, two visions in one. It's Gus and the truck in the same place. Gus is in danger. (hurries from the room) We have to save Gus! Come on!

INT. LASSITER'S CAR, NIGHT

LASSITER speeds along the road, siren blaring. JULIET sits in the passenger seat and SHAWN is in the back.

SHAWN:
All right. I left Mr. and Mrs. Gaffney a message, but Gus isn't picking up at all. Someone give me a gun.

BOTH:
No.

LASSITER:
What exactly is going on?

SHAWN:
Okay, okay, remember when I said that Jan Anglund didn't exist? Well, technically I was right. You know what? Forget that. I was totally right. He's not Jan Anglund. He's a con man working with Mace Rhoden, the guy who stole your mustard refrigerator truck.

JULIET:
Keep talking.

SHAWN:
Well, a few months ago, they started a long con on Mira Gaffney. The plan was for Jan to romance Mira and marry her on the beach in Santa Barbara. But Mira's parents asked too many questions. So Jan doctored the photos to convince them to have the wedding.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. HOTEL, HALL, DAY

MIRA:
See, my parents were against this thing from the beginning, so Jann photoshopped some pictures to make it look like we've been together for longer than we had, and it worked.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. LASSITER'S CAR, NIGHT

SHAWN:
The wedding was merely a cover, so that Mira's father would shut down the winery for a day. Jan intended to leave Mira at the altar, while mace broke into David Gaffney's cellar to steal his priceless wine collection and skip town.

JULIET:
But there was no robbery at the winery. And Jan didn't skip town. He came back.

SHAWN:
He had a change of heart.

JULIET:
Oh, don't tell me...

SHAWN:
There's something about Mira. Jan was telling the truth and lying at the same time.

FLASHBACK

EXT. GOLF COURSE, DAY

JANN:
The truth is, I was in another relationship. I was in a bad situation. I had to end it before I could marry Mira.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. LASSITER'S CAR, NIGHT

SHAWN:
His other relationship was with his partner Mace. He ended it because he actually fell in love with Mira and couldn't go through with the plan. That's why they argued at the golf course. And that's why Mace killed him.

LASSITER:
But why is Guster in trouble?

SHAWN:
Because it's Thursday night, Lassie. The Gaffneys are moving their most expensive bottles of wine to Napa tomorrow. Meaning that Mace is stealing them right now! Somebody give me a gun!

BOTH:
No!

SHAWN:
(falls back against the seat) Then drive faster! That's my best friend in there!

INT. WINERY, NIGHT

SHAWN leads the way as they run across the catwalks and down the stairs to the collection room. DAVID and PHYLLIS meet them at the bottom of the stairs.

SHAWN:
Good! You got my message.

DAVID:
Yeah, we looked. We can't find 'em anywhere.

SHAWN:
The wine cellar. Gus! (runs)

INT. WINERY, CELLAR, NIGHT

SHAWN:
(muffled from outside) Gus!

LASSITER kicks open the door and he and JULIET enter with guns drawn. RHODEN is knocked out on the floor and GUS is lying on top of MIRA. All three are dripping wet. SHAWN, DAVID and PHYLLIS follow behind the police.

GUS:
Don't shoot! Everything's okay.

PHYLLIS:
Mira? (hurries over)

MIRA:
Mom!

DAVID:
What is going on here? What have you gotten her into?

GUS and PHYLLIS help MIRA stand.

GUS:
Well...

SHAWN:
Gus! Don't speak. I can tell you precisely what happened here, sir. Gus and Mira discovered, uh, Mace Rhoden robbing the cellar. He pulled a gun. (kicks RHODEN'S gun to JULIET) He tied them up. And Gus assessed the situation and devised the following brilliant plan. (moves to stand by GUS) He finessed them loose. He told Mira to perform her dragon-headed bar trick that made him fall for her in the first place, triggering the sprinklers. They wrestled over the gun. (wrestles GUS) Mira fainted. (fake faints) And we walked in just as Gus DDT'd the bad guy. (slaps GUS on the back)

DAVID:
Well done, Guster. Well done. (reaches out hand)

GUS:
Thank you, sir. (shakes DAVID'S hand)

LASSITER:
Very impressive.

JULIET:
Yeah, very quick thinking.

GUS:
I was just doing what anyone would have done.

DAVID:
Honey, let's get you out of here.

MIRA:
But...

DAVID:
Darling...

PHYLLIS:
Come on. Come on, sweetie.

DAVID and PHYLLIS help MIRA from the room.

MIRA:
I just don't remember...

DAVID:
Let's go.

PHYLLIS:
Yeah, it's time to go.

JULIET pulls RHODEN up from the floor.

JULIET:
God, he's all wet.

JULIET and LASSITER leave with RHODEN.

GUS:
Dude, that's not how it happened.

SHAWN:
I know. Mace's cigarette triggered the sprinklers, and he slipped and fell?

GUS:
And then I may have knocked Mira over as I ran away.

SHAWN:
Let's keep that last part to ourselves.

GUS:
You bet.

SHAWN and GUS fist-bump and SHAWN slaps GUS on the back before they leave.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and MIRA are in the office.

MIRA:
You guys, it's been such a crazy week. But thanks to you both, I'm gonna get through it. So thank you. Oh, oh, Shawn, Gus and me are gonna go rock-climbing in Rattlesnake Canyon. And then I'm gonna teach him how to hang glide off Cathedral Peak. And it's gonna be so amazing. Do you wanna come?

MIRA turns to face SHAWN and GUS emphatically mouths "No" behind her back and waves his hands.

SHAWN:
Uh... You know what, Mira? We just got a call from a prospective client. Something about a ghost in a ballroom.

GUS:
We should probably go work on that. Is that okay, Mira?

MIRA:
Oh, of course. I totally understand. You guys do amazing work. (SHAWN puts a hand over his heart) But I just wanna see you both before I leave.

GUS:
Mira's moving to Greenland to save polar bears.

SHAWN:
Of course you are.

MIRA:
(gasps) Do you wanna come visit for Christmas? Gus is coming for Christmas.

GUS:
I am?

MIRA:
Yeah, remember? We talked about this, silly. (slaps GUS playfully on the arm) Think about it. Bye. (gives SHAWN a high-five and then low-five behind her back) Thanks again, guys. (laughs as she leaves)

GUS laughs until the door closes behind MIRA.

GUS:
Dude, thank you for that. And thank you for putting up with me throughout this whole thing. I know I was a little...

SHAWN:
Whipped?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Gay?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
Annoying?

GUS:
Well, I was gonna say love-struck but, sure, fine. And once again, I just wanna say for the record, I'm sorry I never told you about being married.

SHAWN:
I understand.

Outside, car tires screech and a horn blares.

SHAWN:
Now I really understand. Besides, I've been feeling a little guilty myself.

GUS:
About what?

SHAWN:
About not telling you that I, too, was married. (gives GUS a folder and walks out)

GUS:
What? You were not married, Shawn. Please. This is a fake, right? I know this is fake.

GUS opens the folder and sees a photo of SHAWN in a tux, a bride and a rabbi skydiving.

GUS:
You photoshopped this. Shawn, get back here! (walks out the door after SHAWN) You trying to tell me you went skydiving with a rabbi? Shawn!

Episode 2x12 The Old and the Restless

EXT. BEACH, DAY

SHAWN and his GRANDFATHER are sitting on a park bench in front of the house facing the beach. SHAWN opens a bag of breadcrumbs to feed the birds.

GRANDFATHER:
Put that down. We're not here to feed the birds. That's just a cover to throw your dad off.

SHAWN:
Well, if we're not here to feed the birds, what are we here to do, Grandpa?

GRANDFATHER:
We're here to girl watch, everything they do is magical, mysterious. Your grandmother was a lifetime of surprises. Now, what can you tell me about her?

GRANDFATHER points to a woman on the beach. SHAWN sees a strap mark on her left ankle.

SHAWN:
She's a surfer. She's goofy-footed.

GRANDFATHER:
Goofy?

SHAWN:
Left-handed, but with her feet.

GRANDFATHER:
No, stop. Stop that right now. I don't want you to profile her, or tell me who she actually is. I want you to tell me who you think she is. What she likes, what she dreams about. Use your imagination.

SHAWN:
Well, then her name is Larsa Von Lykenhoffer.

GRANDFATHER:
(laughs) German broad! Yes! What else? What else?

SHAWN:
And she's a giraffe wrangler and a test pilot. And it's possible she's a Manimal.

GRANDFATHER laughs and neither notices HENRY as he walks up to them.

HENRY:
(leans on bench back) Shawn, I thought I told you to finish the dishes before you feed the birds. Dad, Shawn's got chores that come before goofin' off at the beach.

GRANDFATHER:
Let me relax with my grandson.

HENRY:
What are you two doing exactly?

GRANDFATHER:
Just beach gazing! You wouldn't understand!

HENRY:
I understand. You wanna beach gaze? Scoot over. (taps SHAWN as he moves over and sits on the bench) You wanna beach gaze. We'll all beach gaze. (crosses arms) Close your eyes, Shawn. How many towels with red stripes?

SHAWN closes his eyes.

GRANDFATHER:
Here we go with the towel thing again.

SHAWN:
(remembers the towels) Four.

GRANDFATHER:
Henry, do you have to drain the fun out of everything?

HENRY:
Dad, I want you to leave the raising of my son to me. All right? He's got responsibilities. (to SHAWN) And you, you, better be two steps behind me, 'cause you got a date with some suds and a sponge. (ruffles SHAWN'S hair and leaves)

SHAWN starts to get up to follow HENRY when his GRANDFATHER stops him.

GRANDFATHER:
Do me a favor, Shawn. Sometimes you gotta let what your dad says float through the ears. Make your own choices. Don't take life too seriously. Travel the world. Meet interesting people. Have some adventures. Because some day you're gonna wake up and realize you're too old to do anything really fun.

SHAWN:
Yes, Grandpa.

PRESENT DAY

EXT. WOODS, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS scurry through the wooded area along a tall cement wall to where it meets a chain-link fence.

GUS:
This isn't gonna work, Shawn.

SHAWN:
It's gonna work.

GUS:
We've failed to get in here six times. We haven't gotten to one witness. We haven't seen where the missing man disappeared from. This place is a fortress.

SHAWN:
I think you might be right. Maybe we should crawl.

GUS:
I'm not crawling on this wet grass.

They stop at a gate with high voltage signs posted.

SHAWN:
Dude, I read an article that says 90% of high-voltage signs are bogus. They just hang them up there to scare people off.

GUS:
Good theory. You test it.

SHAWN:
I can't touch that. I conduct way more electricity than you. You know that. Touch it. Just use your fingertip.

GUS:
I'm not touching an electrified fence, Shawn.

A large GUARD puts a hand on each of their shoulders and pins them around to face him.

GUARD:
How about I touch it?

SHAWN:
I don't think I like the way that sounds.

The GUARD shoves them away.

INT. HENRY'S, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

HENRY is sitting on the couch reading a magazine while drinking a beer as SHAWN and GUS try to sneak past him with items for a stakeout; binoculars, a cooler, boots, flashlight and a grappling hook.

HENRY:
What the hell are you two doing with my stuff?

SHAWN:
We need tools.

HENRY:
For what?

SHAWN:
(sighs and sets down cooler) If you must ask, it's for a stakeout, okay. We've got a tough case, and our binoculars only go up to 2x.

HENRY:
Well, what are you doing with my cooler?

GUS:
We have to keep the gelato cold in the car.

HENRY:
You two girls are useless. Shawn, didn't you learn anything I ever taught you about surveillance?

SHAWN:
We happen to be awesome at covert ops.

GUS:
We just ran into a bit of a gauntlet, and took a missing person case based in an extremely difficult place to crack.

HENRY:
Uh-huh. And what impenetrable stronghold did this missing person disappear from?

SHAWN:
(mumbles) Glorious Pines.

HENRY:
Say again?

SHAWN:
Glorious Pines.

HENRY:
The old age home?

SHAWN:
It's a retirement community.

GUS:
It's top-of-the-line in independent senior living, with a full-time security team.

HENRY:
My son, the super sleuth, can't even get himself access into an old folk's home.

SHAWN:
No, no, no, no, Dad. You have no idea what we're up against. Okay? I tried everything. I tried the whole I'm-a-traveling-doula bit, (Australian accent) the-dingo-ate-my-baby routine, (normal voice) hiding-Gus-in-a-sack trick, which never fails. Trust me. You wouldn't have gotten any closer than we did.

HENRY:
Give me a break. I'll be in that joint, crack the case in eight minutes.

SHAWN and GUS look at each other and smile.

SHAWN:
(laughs) Okay, yeah, tomorrow. It's on. Show us how it's done.

HENRY:
No, wait, just hold on a second. I didn't mean to...

SHAWN:
Exactly.

SHAWN and GUS lean over to pick up the cooler.

HENRY:
(leans forward) 6:00 a.m. sharp.

SHAWN:
That's too early.

GUS:
How about 9:00?

HENRY:
9:00's a little late.

SHAWN:
Come on, guys. Let's be reasonable. Just split the difference. Okay? Call it 11:15.

HENRY:
6:00 it is. I'll drive.

INT. TRUCK, DAY

SHAWN and HENRY are sitting in HENRY'S parked truck. GUS is asleep, his head resting on HENRY'S shoulder. HENRY looks through binoculars towards the entrance of Glorious Pines just down the road.

SHAWN:
You sure you wanna park this close, Dad? We're almost a quarter of a mile away.

HENRY:
Shawn, we're exactly where we should be to get a read on the situation.

SHAWN:
I can literally see the curvature of the earth from here.

HENRY:
You know, Shawn, why don't you honk the horn and let them know that we're here while you're at it? Who is this missing guy?

SHAWN:
Oswald Chester, resident, 73 years old. (pulls photo from shirt pocket and gives it to HENRY) He's been missing for three days. And what we've gathered from our client is the community is trying to cover it up.

HENRY:
Your client went to the police already?

SHAWN:
I don't know, Dad. We didn't get that far.

HENRY:
What? You didn't ask the question? What are you doing, Shawn? Didn't you learn anything that I tried to...

SHAWN:
All right, that's enough of this nonsense. (gets out of the truck)

HENRY:
No, not enough. We've just started. (gets out of the truck)

GUS is startled awake when HENRY slams the door.

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN strides down the street and HENRY hurries to catch up.

HENRY:
Slow down, would you? What are you gonna do, march right in there?

GUS catches up to them.

GUS:
That looks to be the plan.

HENRY:
No wonder you guys are failing so badly. Rule number one, never make yourself known to your target. Rule number two...

SHAWN:
Dad, you got your glasses?

HENRY:
Yeah, of course I got my glasses.

SHAWN:
Good. Go ahead and put 'em on.

EXT. GLORIOUS PINES, ENTRANCE, DAY

They walk towards the main entrance of Glorious Pines.

HENRY:
What?

SHAWN:
Here, give me that. (takes HENRY'S coffee)

HENRY:
Oh, a disguise. Look at you go. Right out of the private eye handbook, huh?

SHAWN reaches into the shopping cart of a man passing by and pulls out a worn bucket hat.

SHAWN:
Here, put this on too. (gives hat to HENRY)

HENRY:
This thing's like 100 years old. (puts on hat)

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, LOBBY, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter through the sliding doors followed by HENRY.

HENRY:
But Shawn, I look like Henry Fonda.

SHAWN:
Allow me to apologize in advance for this. (throws coffee onto HENRY)

HENRY:
Ah... hot! What the hell, Shawn? What the hell?

GUS spots a cane leaning against a sofa and tosses it to SHAWN. SHAWN gives it to HENRY.

SHAWN:
Hold this for a sec?

HENRY:
What?

SHAWN and GUS walk over to the reception area where a sever woman stands behind the counter.

WOMAN:
May I help you?

SHAWN:
Yes, Pamela, is it? (peers at nametag)

PAMELA:
That's what it says right in front of you. May I help you?

SHAWN:
We are here to check somebody in.

PAMELA:
Really? And who might that be?

SHAWN:
My grandfather.

SHAWN, GUS and PAMELA look over at HENRY who then makes a face.

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, LOBBY, DAY

HENRY:
I'm not doing this. Shawn... No, Shawn. Shawn...

SHAWN:
Grampy. Grampy! Calm blue ocean.

HENRY:
I'm not doing it! I'm not doing...

SHAWN:
Calm blue ocean. Go to your quiet place.

PAMELA:
I'm sorry, but we don't accept walk-in admissions. There's an application and a very long waiting list.

HENRY:
Uh, fine. We're leaving.

HENRY starts to walk away but SHAWN hooks his arm and pulls him back.

SHAWN:
No, no, no. Absolutely. He just got in off the waiting list.

HENRY:
God, I'm not on any damn waiting list.

GUS:
Please forgive our Grampy here. He gets irate and a little forgetful.

SHAWN, HENRY and PAMELA look at GUS.

PAMELA:
You two are brothers?

SHAWN:
Our father worked at Benetton.

PAMELA:
And what's your grandfather's name?

SHAWN:
Talmadge McGulager.

PAMELA:
Just a moment. (walks away)

HENRY:
Talmadge McGulager? Brilliant. (walks away from counter) All right, look, what the hell are you guys doing here?

GUS:
This is the part where you get blindsided with Plan B. It's kinda fun when it's not happening to me.

SHAWN:
Look, I'm getting us in. Relax, Dad. I mean, Grandpappy.

HENRY:
This is never gonna work.

PAMELA comes out into the lobby.

PAMELA:
Mr. McGulager? Looks like we're all set.

HENRY:
(stunned) What?

PAMELA:
You're who I've been waiting for. My apologies. I'm Pamela, the chief administrator. (walks over and shakes his hand) My goodness, you don't look remotely old enough to live here.

HENRY looks smugly at SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Grandpapa is 72. It's true. The thing is he used to be a male model. That's why he looks so young. You can see he had a lot of plastic surgery done.

PAMELA:
(peers at his face) 72? My, my, they have done marvelous work. I would have guessed 59, 60 tops.

SHAWN smiles at HENRY'S discomfort.

HENRY:
All right, you listen here, lady, I'm not a day over...

SHAWN:
Opa! You be sweet to Pamela. She's here to help us. She is a helper. Sorry, Pamela. He's gone a little... How can I put this eloquently? (spins a finger beside his head and mouths "Loco")

PAMELA:
I understand. A lot of our residents are hesitant at first. Excuse me while I get some forms. (leaves)

SHAWN looks around and heads up the stairs. GUS goes with him  and HENRY reluctantly follows.

HENRY:
All right, how did you know about this Talmadge?

SHAWN:
Dad, use the cane. It really helps sell it.

They stop on the landing and look down into the common room where some couples are dancing while others watch.

HENRY:
Wait, wait, wait. You had this planned all along?

SHAWN:
I snatched this off one of the guards that tossed us. (holds up small notepad) According to the schedule, Talmadge McGulager was supposed to check in last night. So I called Mr. McGulager and informed him that the community is infested with African Gambian Pouch Rats.

GUS:
The largest rats in the world. Nice.

SHAWN:
He'll be back in three days. It's the amount of time it takes to fly in and deploy the pouch rat's natural predator.

GUS:
The Sudanese birch pelican.

HENRY:
You don't actually expect me to spend three days here.

SHAWN:
No, no, no. We're gonna solve it in two. The third day is really more about reflection. Besides, with you in here, we'll be able to get visitor's passes, come and go as we please.

HENRY:
All right, all right, I'll tell you what, Shawn. Normally I'd storm outta here. I'd leave you in the lurch. But this time, kid, just this time, I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'll be your Talmadge MaGooder.

SHAWN:
McGregor.

GUS:
McGulager.

SHAWN:
Exactly.

HENRY:
I'll be all those guys. And I'll have this case solved by lunch.

SHAWN:
(laughs) Considering they eat lunch here at 10:15, I'm gonna say we'll have it done by 9:45.

HENRY:
You're on.

SHAWN:
You're on.

PAMELA returns with a stack of papers in her hands.

PAMELA:
Mr. McGulager, why don't I show you around the facilities and your grandboys fill out your admissions paperwork?

HENRY, SHAWN and GUS head back down the stairs to PAMELA.

HENRY:
That's a brilliant idea, boys. Why don't you get right on that?

SHAWN:
Can we fill that out later? We'd really like to take a look around as well.

GUS:
Yeah, and I have a bit of carpal tunnel going on. (rubs wrist)

SHAWN:
We'll just tag along if that's okay.

PAMELA:
You don't take one step past this point until all of these forms are complete. (hands forms to SHAWN) There are two signatures which must be in blue. (SHAWN hands forms to GUS) I'll let you figure out which ones those are. Lester here will check your work when you're done.

PAMELA walks away and LESTER, a large guard, comes over and stands in front of them.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK has called JULIET and LASSITER into her office.

JULIET:
You wanted to see us, Chief?

VICK:
What's your caseload like?

JULIET:
Light.

LASSITER:
...ish.

VICK:
Good answer. Because I have a special assignment that comes directly from the Mayor.

LASSITER:
The Mayor? Really?

VICK:
Yes! There's your assignment.

VICK points to the bullpen and JULIET and LASSITER turn around. Sitting by one of the desks is a teenage boy. He sticks out a leg and trips an officer as he walks past.

JULIET:
Is he a witness or something?

VICK:
No, he's just a delinquent. He's been pulling off some penny ante vandal stuff. Taking down street signs, crazy gluing parking meter slots, removing hood ornaments. Nothing serious yet, but...

LASSITER:
Ah, but that's how it starts. One minute they're destroying public property and the next thing you know they're shooting cops.

VICK:
So what I need you to do is...

LASSITER:
No, I know exactly where you were going with this thing, chief. It's like our brains are just connected on this thing. I'm just trying to figure out how we try this kid as an adult.

VICK:
I need you to dial it back about 50 notches, or I will ask you to put your gun on my desk. What you are going to do is straighten him out. Spend a little time with him. Take him on a ride-along. Nurture him. Show him what a life of crime leads to.

JULIET:
And he gets this special treatment because?

VICK:
His mother's the Deputy Mayor, and she doesn't want the kid in the system. So just fix him.

LASSITER and JULIET share a look as VICK sits.

LASSITER:
Yes, ma'am.

JULIET and LASSITER leave the office.

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, HALL, DAY

GUS rubs his wrist as they walk down the hall.

GUS:
I think all that writing gave me a ganglion cyst.

SHAWN:
You can't get a cyst from filling out paperwork.

GUS:
If the pen is wrong, you can. There's definitely some carpal bossing in there. We should see if they have some extra thumb splints lying around.

SHAWN:
You know what we should do? We should enroll you in some man classes.

HENRY approaches from down the hall.

HENRY:
Well, well, well. Look who's here. While you two guys were off dottin' your I's and crossing your T's, I was busy cracking your case.

A short GUARD comes up to them from behind HENRY.

GUARD:
It worked. You're finally in. (ushers them down the hall)

HENRY:
Who the hell is he?

SHAWN:
He's our client.

HENRY:
What, you had a guy on the inside, and you needed me to get you in here? Come on!

GUARD:
I didn't get all the clearances I was hoping for, okay?

GUS:
Jervis works here part-time. He doesn't exactly get the respect he deserves.

The same GUARD who kicked SHAWN and GUS out the night before, walks down the hall and knocks into JERVIS.

JERVIS:
Whoa! (regains footing)

GUARD:
(recognizes SHAWN and GUS) Hey! How the hell did you two get in here? You're coming with me.

GUS:
I don't think so.

SHAWN and GUS hold up their passes.

SHAWN:
Bam! Say it with me. Visitor's badge!

GUS:
Aha-ha, Aha-ha. Do something. I dare you!

GUARD:
I'll be watching you.

SHAWN:
We'll be gettin' watched.

With a glare at JERVIS, the GUARD walks away.

JERVIS:
Jeez, we gotta hurry. I'm not supposed to be off lawn duty. I'll show you where you're sleeping.

HENRY:
I'm not sleepin' anywhere.

HENRY follows as JERVIS takes SHAWN and GUS down the hall.

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, CHESTER'S ROOM, DAY

JERVIS opens the door and leads the way into the room,

JERVIS:
I at least got them to give Talmadge the other empty bed in Oswald's room.

HENRY:
Yeah, you practically own the joint. (closes the door behind him)

SHAWN:
Jervis, give him the scoop, so he'll shut up for a minute.

JERVIS:
Oswald disappeared from this room three mornings ago without a trace.

HENRY:
Mmm-hmm. I'm gonna ask the first question that my son should have asked. Have you tried the police?

JERVIS:
The police? The police couldn't catch bird flu at a Hong Kong duck farm. They blew me off just like the staff here did.

HENRY:
Anything else you wanna tell us, Mr. Kent?

JERVIS:
No, not that I can think of.

HENRY:
Are you sure?

SHAWN:
Dad, what are you getting at? Just spit it out.

HENRY:
Shawn, Oswald Chester disappeared from these grounds 12 times before, and in the last three instances they threatened to throw his ass outta here if he ever did it again. Don't you check these nutcases out before you take 'em on?

GUS:
Is that true, Jervis?

JERVIS:
Uh, yes.

HENRY:
Did you also happen to mention to my son that during these jaunts, the community here filled out a missing persons report only to have good old Ozzie pop up the next day?

JERVIS:
Guys, I know what this sounds like. But Ozzie did not run off on his own. Not this time.

GUS:
And you know this how?

JERVIS:
He was my best friend. I could always tell when he was getting antsy, when he wanted to run. But this time there were no warning signs. He just vanished into thin air.

HENRY:
(scratches head) Jervis, life lesson number 20. People lie, and they leave without warning. Life sucks.

SHAWN looks at the bedside table and sees a wallet as well as a braided rope bracelet.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. I'm getting something. It's strong, leathery, could be alligator. He left without his wallet. He doesn't have his wallet.

JERVIS:
That's amazing.

SHAWN:
Can't get very far without cash, can you, Pop?

JERVIS:
Yeah, and all his cash and credit cards are still in his wallet.

GUS:
You went through his wallet?

JERVIS:
Of course I did. I'm investigating this thing too, you know. I have a theory based on formaldehyde and mind control.

HENRY:
Jervis, do you mind if I confer with my two grandsons here for a moment while we work through all this?

JERVIS walks to the door and stops as HENRY opens it.

JERVIS:
But you haven't heard my identical twins theory... (steps outside)

HENRY:
First thing tomorrow morning. (closes the door) All right, Shawn. Come on, let's go. There is no case here. This guy is just AWOL.

SHAWN and GUS begin to look around the room and SHAWN picks up the bracelet for closer inspection.

GUS:
Hey, look at this. Oswald was on Prazosin for high blood pressure.

SHAWN:
(walks over) Why would he possibly leave without his Parlection?

HENRY:
You can fill that prescription anywhere, Shawn.

SHAWN clicks his tongue. He looks around the room and sees a photo of a younger Oswald in track gear, a tattoo on his inner right forearm. He also looks at the calendar hanging on the wall and notices increasing numbers written in on certain days: 5, 6, 20, 26.2.

SHAWN:
He went running.

HENRY:
What?

They all walk over and look at the calendar.

SHAWN:
He was training for a marathon. (claps hands) Those numbers are the distances he was trying to reach, and the date that's circled is the Santa Barbara Marathon.

HENRY:
And how do you know that?

SHAWN:
Easy. It's the same as Val Kilmer's birthday. We gotta figure out where he went jogging.

HENRY:
All right, Shawn, I'm gonna humor ya. Let's get outta here. (leaves)

SHAWN:
Humor me? That was spot on. It's like almond butter with honey.

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS join up with HENRY and walk down the hall.

HENRY:
You only know that because you have an unhealthy fascination with the guy from Real Genius.

SHAWN:
Okay, that's it. You're not coming with us. I am going down to that Nazi lady at the front desk, and I am having your in-out privileges revoked.

PAMELA approaches them with a woman pushing a room service cart.

PAMELA:
Oh, Mr. McGulager. This is Meredith Cloverfield.

MEREDITH:
Hi, I'm in charge of room service here.

PAMELA:
She's gonna check on your special dietary needs. (continues past them)

MEREDITH:
Now, do you have any digestive issues?

HENRY:
No, no, not...

SHAWN:
Don't let him lie to you, Miss Cloverfield. He has a very weak heart. All he can have is egg whites and powdered dirt. (walks past MEREDITH)

GUS:
(pats HENRY on the back) And he shouldn't have any solid foods after noon.

GUS joins SHAWN and they walk backwards shooting "air baskets" as they go.

MEREDITH:
Is that true?

HENRY:
No, no. My son is a liar.

MEREDITH:
Your son?

HENRY:
No, no. I, uh, my grandson, too, both liars. Big filthy liars.

EXT. GLORIOUS PINES, ENTRANCE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS take off their passes as they walk out the door and slip them into their pants pockets.

GUS:
So how are we gonna blindly trace a man's jogging path?

SHAWN:
We're gonna use my Indian blood.

GUS:
You can't get Indian blood by working in a casino.

SHAWN:
(scoffs) Maybe you can't.

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk out to the street and intersection.

SHAWN:
Dude, this place goes nowhere. If I was gonna run, I'd go that way. (goes right)

>>> LATER >>>

They come to a halt where there is a barrier across the road and can see hikers and joggers.

GUS:
Now where do we go?

SHAWN sees a sign for the hiking and jogging trail.

SHAWN:
I sense he'd go this way. (walks towards trail entrance)

GUS:
Wow, that's amazing, Shawn. (follows SHAWN)

EXT. PARK, DAY

SHAWN and GUS cross a bridge.

GUS:
Man, this guy was in good shape.

SHAWN:
Would you stop it? He was, like, 100. Maybe if you weren't wearing plowman's boots.

GUS:
I'm not wearing plowman's boots, Shawn!

They come to a fork in the trail. The right side is uphill and shaded. The left is lower and sunnier.

SHAWN:
All right, looks like we got two options.

GUS:
I say we go this way. (starts for the left fork)

SHAWN:
No, hold up. Let's think this through for a minute.

SHAWN turns around and looks at the sun, had held up to shade his eyes. He turns back, kneels on the ground and pinches some dirt between his fingers, sniffing it. He then licks it.

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
(stands) I'd go uphill first, save the downhill part for the home stretch. Plus this side gets better shade in the afternoon. I'm also sensing some water buffalo nearby.

GUS:
What is that, your Indian blood? (walks to the right trail)

SHAWN:
(walks up the path with GUS) They were here first, Gus. Don't ever forget that. Always hatin' on the Indians.

GUS:
It's not the Indians, Shawn. I'm hatin' on you. (shoves SHAWN)

GUS and SHAWN come to an uphill climb with wide terraced dirt steps edged with wood. On a large stone alongside the path, SHAWN notices blood.

SHAWN:
Dude, that rock is sprayed with arterial red. (jogs up the steps)

GUS:
(follows SHAWN) Maybe it's road kill. Taste it.

SHAWN:
(stops and faces GUS) What is that about?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
My whole life you've been trying to get me taste blood. Every time I cut myself or scrape myself, it was, (as GUS) "Shawn, taste it, lick it. It'll make you feel better."

GUS:
It does. Lick it.

SHAWN:
It's not my blood. It's on a rock. (picks up something from the ground by the rock) Dude, a pedometer. It's exactly what a marathon runner would be carrying around with him. How far would you say we are from the community? (looks at readout)

GUS:
I would say about six miles.

SHAWN holds out the pedometer for GUS to read: 6.03 miles.

GUS:
I guess we found the place where he fell.

SHAWN:
Yeah, we did. Now we got a bigger problem. If he's not at the community, and he's not here, where the hell is his body?

They look around them at the wooded area.

INT. HOSPITAL, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter through the double doors.

GUS:
This is the closest hospital to the drop zone. If someone came across Oswald's body, this is where he would be.

They walk up to the nurses' station.

SHAWN:
Hi there. We're looking for my father, Oswald Chester.

The WOMAN checks the computer.

WOMAN:
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone here by that name.

SHAWN:
Hmm. You know what? He left his I.D. at home. Can you check for a John Doe, please? Actually, can you check all the Does? Tae-kwon, cookie, Play, do-si...

WOMAN:
I'm sorry. Visiting hours just ended.

SHAWN taps the countertop before he and GUS walk away.

SHAWN:
Looks like we're gonna have to go...

GUS:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
Incognito.

SHAWN steps into a supply room as GUS walks into a locker room right next door. A few moments later they each exit. SHAWN is wearing a doctor's lab coat over blue scrubs with a stethoscope around his neck. GUS is wearing a pink-striped smock over his clothes, a small paper cap on his head.

SHAWN:
Candy striper? Really? I didn't even know they made those uniforms for men.

GUS:
They just started. There was a lawsuit.

SHAWN:
I'm just saying, aim higher.

SHAWN walks away. GUS angrily takes off the cap and puts in back in the locker room before following SHAWN.

EXT. STREET, DAY

LASSITER drives along the road.

INT. CAR, DAY

JULIET is in the passenger seat and the BOY is in the back behind the grate.

LASSITER:
I hope you understand what a huge break you're getting here.

BOY:
This back seat smells like foot. I mean, seriously, did something die back here?

LASSITER:
That's the smell of your future unless you straighten up and fly right.

BOY:
(puts fingers through the grate and looks at JULIET) What's your story, baby?

JULIET:
Excuse me?

LASSITER:
It's Detective O'Hara, punk. And that's strike one.

BOY:
Is he always like this?

JULIET:
Call me baby again, you're gonna get on my bad side too.

BOY:
Whoa, what bad side? All good from where I'm sitting.

LASSITER:
Hey, unless you wanna pee in front of seven other guys for the rest of your life, you will respect the badge.

JULIET:
Why don't you tell me why you're acting out?

LASSITER:
I'm not acting out! He started it!

JULIET:
I was talking to the kid.

BOY:
Did anyone tell you that your hair smells like strawberries?

LASSITER:
Peaches.

JULIET and the BOY look at him.

LASSITER:
(recovers) I have to buy peaches on the way home. I just remembered.

JULIET smiles.

BOY:
So, uh, Juliet...

LASSITER:
It's Detective O'Hara! Strike two.

BOY:
You gotta lighten up, man. You get to hang out with this amazingly hot woman all day long.

LASSITER:
Detective O'Hara's an officer of the law. She is a competent investigator, efficient with her paperwork, and maintains her work space in a clean and orderly fashion. But she is above all things, not hot! (realizes what he's said and looks straight ahead)

INT. HOSPITAL, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk around a ward and look through the windows at the patients inside.

NURSE:
(over loudspeaker) Wheelchair to admitting. Wheelchair to admitting.

SHAWN sees a tattoo on the forearm of one of the male patients and remembers seeing it on an older photo of Oswald Chester.

GUS:
That's Oswald!

SHAWN:
Let's find out what happened. Medical students?

GUS:
Residents.

SHAWN:
It's all the same to me.

INT. HOSPITAL, WARD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stride into the ward. The four residents look at them.

SHAWN:
Hello. I am Dr. Howser. I am filling in today. This is my personal candy striper Knick Knack.

GUS:
(raises a hand) Hello.

SHAWN:
He's from Guam. We will be instructing you. Let's begin. You, impress me.

RESIDENT 1:
This patient is three days post-op. He has an open wound, which is healing nicely.

The RESIDENT lifts the bandage over the wound and GUS gags. SHAWN and GUS turn away.

SHAWN:
Knick Knack, get a hold of yourself! Or I'll put you on the first raft back to Talofo. (turns back and sees wound) Oh! God! That looks like road kill... (stutters) Yeah, is what his family probably thought when they came here to visit, because they love him. You know what? I was... I was thinking of something more in an older guy. Athletic build. Perhaps in a coma or a coma-like state.

RESIDENT 2:
The patient behind you is in a coma.

SHAWN:
No... (turns to look at Oswald and then back) Perfect. Let's begin there.

They walk over to Oswald and peer down at him.

RESIDENT 1:
John Doe, admitted two days ago with severe hypotension causing low brain perfusion. Also suffered Inter-Cranial bleed from syncope and falling down.

They straighten up. SHAWN looks at GUS questioningly. GUS shrugs.

SHAWN:
What the hell's wrong with you? Where do you get off using all those long, complicated words in front of the patient? You know, when I went to school where one goes to become a doctor...

GUS:
Med school.

SHAWN:
Yes. There was something called bedside manner. Do they not teach that anymore?

RESIDENT 1:
Uh, sir, this patient's unconscious. He can't hear me.

SHAWN:
You're wrong. You're dead wrong. He can hear you. Sure, his body is sleeping, but inside he is dancing, he is feeling it.

GUS:
He's doing his thing.

SHAWN:
And he hears you say all those scary words, and he retreats right back into his mind. Now, do you wanna help this patient or not?

RESIDENT 1:
Of course, sir.

SHAWN:
Then speak to me like I'm ten years old.

RESIDENT 1:
He had a sudden drop in blood pressure, which deprived his brain of blood. He also suffered a contusion and small cerebral hemorrhage.

SHAWN:
(nods) Talk to me like I'm five.

RESIDENT 1:
His blood pressure went boom, and his brain got an owie.

SHAWN:
I see. And why do we suspect foul play?

RESIDENT 2:
We don't suspect foul play.

SHAWN:
Oh, really? You don't find anything at all strange about his condition?

RESIDENT 2:
Well, his BP didn't come up immediately when we administered fluids.

SHAWN:
Uh-huh. And what does that tell us?

RESIDENT 2:
He probably took too much of his blood pressure medication by accident. Sometimes the elderly have to take a lot of pills at different dosages, or they take it, forget, and take it again.

RESIDENT 1:
But there's nothing criminal about that.

SHAWN:
No. No, there's not. Well done. Both of you. I don't know about you, but I'm drained. What do you say we take a fiver, grab a Coke, maybe play some Frogger.

SHAWN and GUS back away towards the door.

RESIDENT 2:
Doctor, we still have a lot of patients to see.

SHAWN:
Five minutes isn't gonna kill them, is it? Is it?

EXT. GLORIOUS PINES, GROUNDS, DAY

GUS and SHAWN walk along a patio with shaded picnic tables. Some residents are playing croquet as other paint.

SHAWN:
We did it, Gus.

GUS:
Yup.

SHAWN:
We beat my dad. Proved our point. Now let's rub it in a little. Maybe make fun of his toes. Give Jervis the good news. Get the hell out of here!

They walk down the steps to the walk.

GUS:
I hear that. I'm starved.

EXT. GLORIOUS PINES, POOL, DAY

HENRY is swimming freestyle as he races other residents. Some of the female residents watch and cheer from the bleachers. HENRY touches the end first. Two men approach HENRY.

MAN 1:
Yeah!

HENRY:
Whoo!

MAN 1:
That's four in a row, Talmadge. (slaps HENRY'S hand) You're on fire!

MAN 2:
You just broke the Pines record.

SHAWN and GUS arrive.

SHAWN:
For what? Number of times jumping in without breaking a hip?

MAN 2:
Yeah, that's funny, kid. Hey, Talmy, who is this?

HENRY:
Oh, this is my s... uh, grandson Shawn and his... Gus. Hey, guys, meet Buddy Markowitz. He used to be a stand-up in the Catskills. And Rodrigo Lopez, one-time number five, clearly no longer, lightweight champion of the world.

BUDDY:
(points to man walking past them) Ah, and that's my Asian friend Hoo Flung Poo.

HENRY, BUDDY and RODRIGO laugh.

SHAWN:
I don't get it.

GUS:
That guy wasn't even Asian.

BUDDY:
Well, that's what makes it funny.

The guys laugh again.

SHAWN:
You mind if we steal G-pop here for a second?

RODRIGO:
Just as long as he's back in time for the cannonball competition!

HENRY:
(pulls himself out of the pool) Oh, yeah! (GUS hands him a towel) Oh, thank you.

We see HENRY is wearing an old-fashioned bathing suit. They leave the pool area.

SHAWN:
What are you wearing?

HENRY:
Well, you didn't pack me any trunks, Shawn. This is the only thing I could borrow.

EXT. GLORIOUS PINES, GROUNDS, DAY

SHAWN:
Yeah, well, while you've been here playing at Camp Cocoon, we've been busy solving the case.

GUS:
We found Oswald. He was in the hospital.

SHAWN:
Time to get you outta here.

HENRY:
No, no, no, no. We can't leave yet.

SHAWN:
Why not?

HENRY:
This case isn't over. Look, this place is a hot bed of suspicious activity.

MEREDITH arrives with lunch for HENRY.

MEREDITH:
Hey there! Here's your sandwich, Talmadge.

HENRY:
Well, thank you, Meredith. Thank you... (picks up sandwich) Where's that barbecue sauce?

MEREDITH:
You know Pamela really doesn't like complainers here. You know, you're lucky. You should see the food give my mother over at that horrible Sunshine Meadows place. It is one step above cat food.

HENRY:
Gee, Mer, I'd feel a whole lot luckier if the sweetest woman in the world would score me just a little teensy, eensy, weensy bit of steak sauce. Come on.

MEREDITH:
(to SHAWN and GUS) Your grandfather is a flirt. (to HENRY) You are, ah! (giggles and walks away)

SHAWN:
That is disgusting. You like it here. You... You do. That's... That's why you wanna keep investigating. Because you like the sandwiches and the adulation.

HENRY:
Shawn, I'm telling you. Something else is going on here.

SHAWN:
Dad, we found Oswald. There's nothing left to solve. Admit it. We beat you because we have the sweetness.

GUARD:
All right, clear a path, folks. Coming through. It's all right.

They look over to the patio where they see a guard clearing a path for EMTs with a man on a gurney.

HENRY:
You have the sweetness? What about that guy, Shawn?

SHAWN sees a bracelet on the sick man's arm similar to the one Oswald had. A woman screams and they turn to the pool where a man who was sitting on the edge had fallen in. Another man dives in to save him.

HENRY:
What about that one?

SHAWN sees another bracelet on the man who fell in.

GUS:
They're dropping like flies.

PAMELA watches from inside.

HENRY:
You saw the bracelets, didn't you?

SHAWN:
Yes, I saw them.

HENRY:
All right, so we got three guys all living at the same place. They all get sick, and for some reason they're all wearing the same bracelets. What were you saying again, Shawn, about solving this case?

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN is acting out a "vision", pretending to be old; walking bent over and talking in a weak, older voice. The BOY is sitting in a chair, watching. VICK is sitting on the edge of a desk as is LASSITER. JULIET stands in front of them.

SHAWN:
Someone is trying to off old-timers at Glorious Pines.

GUS:
Three people have gotten suddenly sick there. It could be an Angel of Death type thing.

LASSITER:
You know, that is a brilliant theory. But what you've failed to take into account is that it's five degrees hotter today than the same day last year. (slaps away SHAWN'S hands)

SHAWN:
(gasps and straightens up) Frogs can't swallow with their eyes open. It's true. I'm sorry, I thought we were offering up useless pieces of information.

JULIET:
What Lassiter here means is that it's not out of the ordinary for older people to fall ill during heat waves or cold snaps.

JERVIS:
Look, we found Oswald when you were convinced he was just wandering around in his bathrobe.

GUS:
This is our client, Jervis Kent.

JERVIS:
I mean, shouldn't you call forensics in? Look at wills, interview beneficiaries? I learned that at the police academy.

VICK:
You went to the academy?

JULIET:
I thought I recognized that name. Aren't you the guy who set his black and white on fire during the academy road test?

LASSITER:
(stands) Yeah, you shot someone's toe off at the police firing range.

JERVIS:
It didn't come all the way off.

LASSITER:
I saw him yesterday. He still has a limp.

SHAWN:
Spool! Threads! Thread! I'm seeing thread. Spinning, and, and, bobbing and weaving. Arting. Yet crafting. (spins his left hand around his right wrist) Bracelets. Homemade bracelets. All three of them had the same bracelet.

LASSITER:
Well, in that case, O'Hara, call CNN because we've got their new lead story.

VICK:
Do the doctors who've been treating any of these patients suspect foul play?

JULIET:
No, Chief.

VICK:
Well, double-check. Mr. Spencer, as always it's been an experience. You know where the exit is. (leaves)

SHAWN and GUS leave with JULIET.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Come on, you gotta finesse that kind...

LASSITER:
Do you see what happens when you act like a jackass all the time? No one takes you seriously. If you do not wanna end up like that buffoon, you better learn to walk the straight and narrow.

The BOY stands and watches as SHAWN talks with JULIET.

BOY:
I don't like that guy.

LASSITER:
There's hope for you yet, kid.

LASSITER slaps the BOY on the back and he flinches. LASSITER walks away.

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, LOBBY, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and JERVIS walk the steps to the second floor.

JERVIS:
And what was all that bracelet talk?

SHAWN:
I sensed a common thread. Pun intended.

JERVIS:
You mean the friendship bracelets? Those came from Chelsea. She makes them herself in craft class. And she doesn't just give 'em to anybody.

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, DANCE FLOOR, DAY

SHAWN and GUS peer around a piano and see HENRY dancing an intense tango with CHELSEA.

SHAWN:
Dude, she's totally dancing with my dad.

GUS:
Where did he learn the tango?

SHAWN:
Grab a partner. Meet me on the dance floor.

GUS and SHAWN split up.

HENRY:
So you knew my friend Oswald, right?

CHELSEA:
He courted me a little.

SHAWN:
(clears throat) Can I, uh, get cutsies?

HENRY:
Find your own partner, Shawn.

CHELSEA:
I don't mind, Talmadge. I haven't had this many men ask me to dance since Nixon went to China.

HENRY spins CHELSEA into SHAWN'S arms.

SHAWN:
Hello. My name is Shawn. I'm Talmadge's grandson. I'm trying to meet all of his new friends. Did he happen to mention that I'm a psychic?

CHELSEA:
Oh, psychic, really?

HENRY shadows them as he watches SHAWN dance.

SHAWN:
I sensed a dark cloud. And then, did you hear about what happened to Harley? The paramedics and all of that stuff?

CHELSEA:
Of course I heard. He's an ex-boyfriend of mine.

GUS is on the other side of the dance-floor with an older WOMAN standing with him as if dancing but they are standing still.

WOMAN:
You dance divinely, Burton.

GUS:
Thank you.

HENRY:
My turn, Shawn.

SHAWN twirls CHELSEA into HENRY'S arms.

HENRY:
So you're quite the queen bee around here? You have many boyfriends here at Glorious Pines?

CHELSEA:
I've had my share of romantic trysts. Men fall in love easily when I start taking care of them.

HENRY:
What do you mean?

WOMAN:
(to GUS) Now spin me. (they don't move) Marvelous.

CHELSEA:
They call it the Florence Nightingale effect.

SHAWN intercepts the couple as they cross the floor and takes HENRY'S place.

SHAWN:
So you're a nurse. You must have done a lot of work here with different medications.

CHELSEA:
Well, not anymore. All I do now is lead the Heart Smart high blood pressure seminar once a month. That's where I met Harley and Oswald.

SHAWN meets HENRY'S eyes over CHELSEA. He then dips her. HENRY jerks his head before leaving.

SHAWN:
Save me a seat at bingo.

SHAWN pulls CHELSEA upright before hurrying after HENRY. GUS' partner is asleep on her feet, snoring.

GUS:
Shawn! Shawn, come back here!

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, HALL, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and HENRY walk down the hall.

HENRY:
We learned that all the victims had high blood pressure, so they might have been on the same medications.

GUS:
I learned that old people are heavy.

SHAWN:
Look, my prized students believe that Ozzie got sick because he overdosed on his medication.

GUS:
Maybe they all did. Which means either three different people all accidentally took too many pills...

SHAWN:
Or someone else slipped it to them.

HENRY:
Wait, wait, wait a minute. I overheard a couple of the guards talking about a break-in at the on-site pharmacy here last week.

SHAWN:
Really? You wait until just now to tell us that?

HENRY:
The thief got away with Codeine and OxyContin, but I think they also got away with blood pressure medication.

SHAWN:
So that stuff was just a cover to make it look like drug-seeker. The BP Meds were the real target. All right, at least that gives us the how. Now we just gotta figure out the why. Which reminds me, Gus, will you please get us those tickets for The Who?

GUS:
Where?

SHAWN and GUS point at each other.

SHAWN:
Look, we need to get a list of all the people on blood pressure medication. They're all targets.

HENRY:
That's something Pamela would have.

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, LOBBY, DAY

HENRY peers through the bannister rails and sees PAMELA in her office. He slowly creeps down the stairs and SHAWN and GUS follow.

HENRY:
We gotta get her outta there. The real Talmadge's stuff showed up this morning. He's gonna be here today.

SHAWN:
I bet she'll come out if a resident hurt themselves. (looks at HENRY) Take a spill down the stairs.

HENRY:
What?

SHAWN:
Just take a quick header down the stairs.

HENRY:
I'm not gonna deliberately hurt myself, break my neck to create a distraction.

SHAWN:
Fine, we'll push you. It'll be an accident. Does that make it easier?

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
(to GUS) What? (to HENRY) You have to do something.

With a sigh of resignation, HENRY kicks his foot against the railings.

HENRY:
Oh, my toe! Ow! Hey, I hurt my toe here!

GUS:
You stubbed your toe?

SHAWN:
Dude, you have to do better than that.

HENRY:
I'm your father. You do not call me "dude".

SHAWN:
Pull your weight! Come on.

HENRY puts his right hand on his right side and staggers down past the landing.

HENRY:
My liver! My liver! Oh, my liver! It could be failing. Aah!

SHAWN and GUS run down to him. HENRY is now holding his left side.

SHAWN:
You go from one to ten like that? How about a heart attack or a stroke?

SHAWN and GUS go down the stairs and hide out of the way so they can sneak into PAMELA'S office when she comes out.

HENRY:
My liver. My liver! Oh, God, it hurts.

HENRY continues to groan. PAMELA hurries from her office. SHAWN and GUS hide behind the center table with its vase of flowers. They spin it along with them to keep out of sight. HENRY sits on the steps.

PAMELA:
Your liver is fine. You're not even jaundiced. (looks to the table but no one is there) Abdominal pain can be caused by a lot of things. You're not even holding your liver. That's your spleen.

HENRY:
My spleen? It's my spleen! It's about to rupture!

PAMELA:
Now, now, now, now, Mr. McGulager, settle down.

GUS and SHAWN run to the office and GUS closes the door behind them.

HENRY:
Oh, it's so painful!

PAMELA:
Just a moment, you're going to be...

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN goes to the computer on a side table and GUS heads for PAMELA'S desk and uses the computer there.

SHAWN:
We need to find a list of people's medications.

GUS:
Cool.

SHAWN looks through a file on the table.

SHAWN:
I think this is it! No, this is the waiting list. Dude, Oswald's getting kicked out tomorrow. It says FTC Next to his name. The other two victims as well. FTC! Ferocious tiger what? (walks over to GUS and slams the paper on the desk)

GUS:
FTC means full-time care. (looks at list) Looks like all the victims need additional nursing assistance now.

SHAWN:
What? They get kicked out for that?

GUS:
This place won't accept anybody that needs continuous medical care. It was all in the informational handbook.

SHAWN:
That's what's happening here. Someone on the waiting list got tired of waiting! Recognize any of those names? (smirks)

GUS:
(taps sheet) We just found our bad guy! (stands) Whoo!

SHAWN and GUS do their own happy dance.

GUS:
What? What? What? What?

There is a knocking at the door and they stop. The knob rattles.

PAMELA:
(muffled) Is someone in there?

SHAWN:
Take the window!

SHAWN and GUS duck out the open window and run away.

PAMELA:
(muffled) Who's in there? Lester! Lester, I need the key.

INT. SBPD, INTERVIEW ROOM, DAY

LASSITER leans against the table. The BOY is sitting in a chair facing a large black man in prison orange.

LASSITER:
This is Darryl Jablonsky. He's currently doing a nickel at the State Pen. Darryl, meet JJ.

DARRYL:
(low gravelly voice) Call me Hell on earth.

LASSITER:
We all thought JJ would benefit in meeting you, Hell. See, you two have a lot in common. JJ here is also a tough guy who's not afraid of the law.

DARRYL:
So what you in for?

JJ:
Vandalism. Repeated.

DARRYL:
Vandalism. So why don't you take his rap sheet back to Chuck E. Cheese, man, because the only thing you're gonna get in here is curb full of Chicago smile and... (moves forward in his seat, pointing at JJ and pauses) I'm sorry. I just can't do this, man.

LASSITER:
Okay, I think he's got the message. Prison is hell. (claps hands) Let's go. (moves to leave)

JJ:
(raises hand to stop LASSITER) Can't do what?

DARRYL:
I can't lie, JJ. It's part of my rehabilitation according to Dr. Shenkman. I'm not supposed to be lying, or anything, you know?

With a sigh, LASSITER leans back against the table and crosses his arms.

JJ:
So, tell me for real, what's it like in prison?

DARRYL:
For real? (chuckles) It ain't bad. I hang out with my best friend, White Slavery, most of the day. We go work out, chill in the library, or we got The Corrections on CD. It's read by Robert Forster. It's pretty good. It's tight, man. I enjoyed it. Then we go back again, we work out, we eat, we sleep, we chit-chat. Play ball, you know what I mean? We do what we do, man. It's, like, good living out here, man.

LASSITER:
Okay, but the guards are merciless.

DARRYL:
Nah, man, they're pretty cool, man. Actually, we're having a birthday party for one of them later on today. (looks over to guard by the door) Hey, is Tyrone baking the cake, man? All right. See? I even have a job in prison, man. Telemarketer, man. Best seller of this month. Believe that. Bang! It's all right in here, man. Don't worry about a thing. You're gonna have a blast, man.

LASSITER:
Okay, this is absolutely pointless. Let's go. Come on! (grabs JJ by the arm and yanks him towards the door) Thanks for nothing, Darryl. (stops at the door) By the way, you can kiss that recommendation at your next parole board hearing sayonara.

DARRYL:
That's cool. I hear we're getting a Frappuccino machine next month.

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, COMMON ROOM, DAY

Some residents are sitting at the tables around the outside having lunch while others sit on chairs and couches. BUDDY is doing a stand-up routine in the middle of the room.

BUDDY:
So, what goes 10, 9, 8, 7, 6? Bo Derek getting old! (no one laughs so he taps another man's hearing aid) Hey! Is this thing on?

SHAWN, GUS, HENRY and JERVIS enter the room from the side.

SHAWN:
There is a malicious force at work in Glorious Pines! The recent rash of illnesses here, not an accident!

PAMELA observes from the second floor.

BUDDY:
(looks around) What the hell's going on here?

CHELSEA:
He's a psychic. Maybe he's having an episode.

SHAWN:
Yes, and I can feel that the culprit is right here in this room, and it's you! (points)

MEREDITH stops behind BUDDY.

BUDDY:
(points to himself) Me? Well, I can't lie. I've killed onstage.

MEREDITH walks over and sets a plate on the table in front of CHELSEA.

SHAWN:
No, no, no, not you. Her!

CHELSEA:
Who me?

SHAWN:
No, not... Not you. Her. Her! Meredith Cloverfield!

Everyone murmurs.

MEREDITH:
What? You...

SHAWN:
A name is coming to my brain. Help me. Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, Rhonda! Rhonda Cloverfield. Your dear old mother at Sunshine Meadows. Seventh on the waiting list to get into The Pines, but you couldn't stand watching her rot away at that hell hole. 'Cause there's no sunshine, and there's no meadows! You love her, so you tried to bump her up that wait list.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, PHARMACY, DAY

MEREDITH breaks the glass of the cabinets and grabs bottles.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
The first thing you did, break into the pharmacy, snatch yourself some blood pressure medication.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, COMMON ROOM, DAY

SHAWN:
And then you targeted the people that were already taking those pills, whose food you served. Chelsea's bracelets practically marked 'em for you. First up, Oswald Chester.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, OSWALD'S ROOM, DAY

MEREDITH is in the kitchenette preparing a meal while Oswald is watching TV. She crushes pills and sprinkles it into the food. Oswald eats without realizing.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
You knew he carbed up before a run. It was the perfect opportunity to make him overdose.

EXT. PARK, DAY

Oswald jogs up the steps, stops and grips his chest before falling and hitting his head on the rock.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, COMMON ROOM, DAY

MEREDITH:
This is outrageous. I couldn't hurt a fly.

SHAWN:
But you could. But she did!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, COMMON ROOM, DAY

MEREDITH serves dinner to two men sitting at a table.

MEREDITH:
There you go.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
Almost killed two other members of this community.

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, HALL, DAY

One of the men is alone in the hall as he clutches his chest and falls to the floor.

EXT. GLORIOUS PINES, POOL, DAY

The other man falls unconscious into the pool.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, COMMON ROOM, DAY

SHAWN:
A couple more people, and you and your mother would have been reunited, and it would have felt so good.

HENRY notices one of the guards walk in with an older man.

HENRY:
(leans over to GUS and whispers) Talmadge McGulager. Our cover's blown.

GUS:
(walks over to SHAWN) Wrap it up, Shawn. Quick!

SHAWN looks over and sees the real Talmadge with the monogram on his shirt pocket. He looks back at MEREDITH and sees powder along her cuticles.

SHAWN:
Check her pockets for pills! I think she's got some on her right now!

SHAWN, GUS and HENRY back away as JERVIS goes to MEREDITH and checks the pockets of her sweater.

MEREDITH:
No! Ow! Ow! How dare you?

JERVIS pulls a baggie from one of her pockets.

JERVIS:
Do you have a prescription for these?

GUS:
Everyone here in the room with high blood pressure, your food may be poisoned!

SHAWN:
That's right! Spit it out!

Many of the residents spit their food into napkins.

SHAWN:
Get some baggies, 'cause this stuff is evidence. Jervis, baby, slap the cuffs on her!

SHAWN climbs on the sofa at the wall of the stairs and pulls himself over the rain onto the landing.

JERVIS:
All I've got is a rubber band and some twisty ties.

GUS:
It's fine, it's great! Just call the police!

GUS and HENRY hurry around either side of the stairs. SHAWN turns around and faces everyone.

SHAWN:
Gotta go! Peace!

INT. GLORIOUS PINES, LOBBY, DAY

SHAWN hurries down the steps and fist bumps GUS as he joins him. HENRY holds out his fist but SHAWN just waves him off. As they run for the door, we see a photo of the residents on the wall, HENRY is front and center.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are waiting as VICK walks over.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, good work on that retirement community case. Here's your check to show our gratitude.

SHAWN:
Thank you.

VICK:
Uh-huh. And in case you were wondering, Miss Cloverfield made a full confession.

VICK walks into the hall followed by GUS and SHAWN

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER comes up behind them, pulling JJ by the arm. JULIET follows.

LASSITER:
I'm sorry, Chief. This demon spawn is beyond my help. (pushes JJ into a chair) I've tried threatening him. I've tried scaring him. I even tried bribery.

JULIET:
I told you kids want X-boxes, not hot chocolate.

LASSITER:
Does anyone know how to get Swiss Miss out of silk? (fingers his tie)

GUS:
Lemon wedges.

LASSITER:
All this kid cares about is what O'Hara's wearing and where she works out. (walks away)

SHAWN:
I'm a little curious myself.

JULIET glares at SHAWN before turning to VICK.

JULIET:
Chief.

VICK:
Yeah.

JULIET:
Since he has some sort of strange attachment to me, maybe I should try talking to him alone.

VICK:
Use my office.

JULIET:
Hey, you. Let's go.

JJ follows JULIET with a smile into VICK'S office. JULIET closes the door behind her. SHAWN and GUS walk closer to peer through the blinds. JULIET leans on VICK'S desk and smiles sweetly at JJ. She then leans forward, pointing a finger into his face, and talks vehemently, waving her hand to encompass everyone outside the office. JJ nods vigorously. She puts both hands on the arms of the chair and whispers in his ear.

SHAWN:
What is going on in there?

JULIET continues her "talk" with JJ who continues to nod, almost in fear. He stands and walks for the door. SHAWN and GUS pretend to be doing something else. VICK stands there with her arms crossed, a smile on her face. JJ steps out of the office, less cocky than when he went in. JULIET watches smugly as JJ walks over to LASSITER who is cleaning his tie.

JJ:
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused earlier, and I promise it won't happen again.

LASSITER:
Well, I'm glad I finally got through to you.

JJ turns around and looks back at JULIET. She points at LASSITER. JJ turns back around.

JJ:
And I thank you for your time, and for keeping the streets of Santa Barbara safe.

JJ looks over to JULIET for approval. She snaps her fingers and points again. JJ sits in the chair by the coffee, hands on his lap. LASSITER looks at JJ and then back to JULIET. He walks over to stand in the middle of the hall. SHAWN, GUS and VICK stand next to him as they watch JULIET walk away from them. VICK smiles as she walks back to her office. SHAWN goes back into the bullpen and SHAWN turns down another hallway. LASSITER is left standing alone in the middle of the hall wiping his tie.

Episode 2x13 Lights, Camera....Homicidio

1987

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

HENRY is sitting on the couch watching a soap opera.

ACTOR:
You look luminous right now.

ACTRESS:
If you're quiet, you can hear the horses sleeping.

ACTOR:
I cannot. It sounds like nothing to me.

SHAWN walks up.

SHAWN:
Dad? What are you watching?

HENRY:
Nothing, Shawn. It's your mom's stupid soap opera. She left it on. I wasn't watching at all. I was taking a nap, actually.

SHAWN:
(sits on the couch) Do you sleep with your eyes wide open?

HENRY:
Okay, Shawn, yes, maybe I was half-watching. Not because I like it, but because it's educational. Pay close attention, you might learn a little something too.

ACTOR:
I had a vasectomy two years ago.

SHAWN:
That Logan is probably cheating on Skye?

HENRY:
No, Shawn, I'm talking about sharpening your skills. Look, watch her closely. Tell me what you see.

SHAWN looks at the TV and sees the ACTRESS looking up, light reflected in her eyes.

SHAWN:
She's looking into the light.

HENRY:
(snaps fingers) Bingo. Looking directly into the lights makes her eyes tear up, she cries. Seen perps do it all the time in the interrogation room.

SHAWN:
So acting's really just a lie?

HENRY:
Of course, Shawn. What, you think those goofballs on CHiPs are really cops?

SHAWN:
Wow, anything else you wanna ruin for me? (walks away)

PRESENT DAY

EXT. TV STUDIO LOT, DAY

SHAWN is behind the wheel of a golf cart, driving GUS around the lot.

GUS:
I don't think we're allowed to be on one of these things, Shawn.

SHAWN:
If they didn't want us to drive it, why did they leave the key sunder the seat?

GUS:
This is not how I wanna be spending my Saturday morning.

SHAWN:
Dude, Lassie called, man. He called us. Us, the team! Besides, this is a real, live television studio, Gus. What could be better?

GUS:
Eating my breakfast. I was having a poached egg with Hollandaise sauce on an English muffin.

SHAWN:
Look, we'll solve it up quick. You'll be back home in no time. (puts phone to his ear) Hello? (closes phone) Dame Judi Dench called. She wants her breakfast back.

GUS:
Did you just do the "Somebody Called and Wants Their Something Back" bit?

SHAWN:
Look around, Gus. These are my people.

GUS:
Who are your people?

SHAWN:
These people. Artists, thinkers, dreamers, guys dressed as toast. Now, if I were a crime scene, where would I be? Here I am.

SHAWN pulls up to a set with an ambulance and police car outside.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk onto a set that is gaudily decorated in purple and gold, made to look like a wealthy home. There is a dead body on the floor and JULIET and LASSITER are interviewing witnesses.

GUS:
Hey, I know this place. This is Corrine's living room.

SHAWN:
Who the hell is Corrine?

GUS:
It's the living room from Explosion Gigantesca de Romance.

SHAWN:
What are you saying?

GUS:
It's a Spanish soap opera, Shawn.

SHAWN:
How do you know that? Who are you? What happened to my best friend?

GUS:
Oh, my gosh! Lassiter's talking to Jorge Gama-Lobo. He plays Vicente on the show. He's my favorite. He slept with Mariana at his own mother's funeral, Shawn.

SHAWN:
What the...

GUS:
It's on in every doctor's office I visit. I had no choice but to get sucked in.

SHAWN:
You had a choice. You still have a choice. Who's the dead guy?

GUS:
That's Rinaldo Nu√±ez. He played Ernesto on the show. He used to be married to Corrine.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, dude. I can't believe you actually watch this show.  It's in Spanish.

GUS:
Everyone in Santa Barbara is watching it, Shawn. The telenovela is a craze.

SHAWN sees very distinctive underwear on the dead man, visible above the trousers. GUS takes SHAWN by the arm and pulls him forward towards the detectives.

GUS:
Okay, whatever this case is, I want in on it. And I don't care how you do it.

LASSITER:
(sarcastic) Spencer, thank God you're here. (normal) Now go home. We don't need you. O'Hara jumped the gun. This thing's pretty much open and shut. (walks away)

SHAWN:
Jules, if you want to spend more time with me, you don't have to trump up some case. You just pick up the phone, give me a call, say "Shawn, I'm here, I've got pudding pops."

JULIET:
(walks over) I'll keep that in mind. Fact is, we have tape of Mr. Gama-Lobo here actually stabbing the victim on camera.

JULIET motions to a monitor behind them and GUS and SHAWN turn around to watch. The scene shows JORGE stabbing Nu√±ez in character.

JORGE:
Will someone listen to me, please? For the last time, I had no idea the collapsible prop knife had been replaced with the real one.

JULIET looks at SHAWN and GUS as if to say "Can you believe this guy?" and walks away.

GUS:
I believe him.

SHAWN:
He's your favorite actor? Really? That felt a little forced to me.

Forensics hands an evidence bag to LASSITER with the weapon. SHAWN sees what appears to be a hair inside.

LASSITER:
Spencer, why are you still here? I told you to run along. Ta-ta. (waves him off)

GUS:
(nudges SHAWN) Hurry up. Ask a question that proves there's more here than meets the eye. Go. (nudges him again)

SHAWN:
I have a question!

The WOMAN with craft services walks past with a trolley of sandwiches.

SHAWN:
Are those delicious looking sandwiches for everybody?

WOMAN:
Yes, for everyone working on the stage here.

SHAWN:
Thank you.

GUS:
That's it? That's your question?

SHAWN:
Follow up question! Do you have salami?

WOMAN:
Not by itself, no, but as part of another sandwich with other Italian meats.

SHAWN:
Hmm. That's interesting. I like that very much.

LASSITER:
All right, everybody, let's bag and wrap this up. Sir, you're gonna need to come with us for some more questions.

JULIET takes JORGE'S arm and helps him stand.

JORGE:
Help me, please, whoever you are.

JULIET and LASSITER escort JORGE from the set.

GUS:
Unbelievable, Shawn. I ask for one case. One case and you couldn't get us in on it.

SHAWN:
Dude, I'm sorry. There's no case here. Lassie's actually right. Your boy stabbed some dude on camera in front of everybody. (replays the stabbing on the monitor) Look... (sees the look on JORGE'S face) Uh-oh.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
There's no tells.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Look at the moment when the knife goes into Nu√±ez.

GUS:
It looks like it hurts.

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But look there. Gama-Lobo's face. He doesn't look angry, he looks frightened. More importantly, he looks surprised. That is not the face of a premeditated killer.

GUS:
So what does that mean?

SHAWN:
I think it means we have a case.

GUS:
Yes!

SHAWN:
A big fat double-stuffed chalupa of a case with guacamole.

GUS:
Yes! (punches SHAWN in the chest before hurrying away)

SHAWN:
(holds a hand to his chest as he straightens) That's too hard!

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN is re-enacting the crime, using GUS as the victim.

SHAWN:
(fake Spanish accent) I hate you, Ernesto! Die!

SHAWN "stabs" GUS in the chest but GUS only looks down at his hand.

SHAWN:
Come on, dude! I'm stabbing you in the heart! Give me something to work with here!

VICK:
Okay, look, that's a very interesting theory, Mr. Spencer, but the tape is pretty damning evidence.

SHAWN:
Chief, all due respect, he'd have to be the worst criminal of all time.

LASSITER:
Or the smartest. Of course he's gonna claim he didn't know the knife was switched.

JULIET:
Aren't we getting ahead of ourselves? Mr. Gama-Lobo isn't under arrest.

LASSITER:
Yet.

JULIET:
The producers have just temporarily suspended him from the show.

GUS:
They pulled him off the show?

VICK:
Temporarily, until more progress is made in the investigation.

GUS:
But you can't do that. He's right in the middle of an important love triangle with Corrine. And we haven't even found out whether Serena's baby is his or not.

The others look at GUS after his impassioned speech.

GUS:
What I meant to say was, the man is an actor on a television program. It is his job, his livelihood. You can't just take away a man's means to sustain himself, to put food on the table. (whispers to SHAWN) I need to know if that baby's his.

SHAWN:
I have just one question.

GUS:
If this is about food, I'm telling you right now, I will not be a happy man.

SHAWN:
How do you explain the hair on the knife?

VICK:
The what?

SHAWN:
I am sensing there was a long hair in the evidence bag. A woman's hair, perhaps belonging to a Ted Nugent impersonator. But one thing is certain, it didn't come from the head of Mr. Gama-Lobo.

VICK:
Um, was there a hair in the bag?

JULIET:
Actually, there was. We haven't run it through the lab yet.

VICK:
Why not?

LASSITER:
Because, Chief, we feel the most damning piece of evidence that tape. The hair could have come from anywhere. The evidence guy who bagged it.

VICK:
Officer Henze is bald, Detective.

They look out the window into the bullpen and see the officer in question.

SHAWN:
I am sensing that the owner of that hair is our killer. Chief, you give us one day. One day! And you have our word, we'll make sure this blatant departmental screw-up doesn't bring down the entire Santa Barbara police world, universe, galaxy.

VICK:
One day.

SHAWN claps his hands.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stride onto the set with purpose.

SHAWN:
But the best news is, now that we're officially on the case, we have craft service privileges, (picks up a paper cup) which means all the gummy bears (reaches into a tub of candy) and Poppycock we can jam in our bellies.

GUS:
(pulls SHAWN away from the food) But we only have one day to eat them. Let's get to work, Shawn. That's Lance Rothstein. Let's start with him. He's the head writer on the show. I saw his picture once in Soap Diary magazine.

SHAWN:
Head writer? He's not even Spanish.

GUS:
No, he was a Hollywood guy, used to write on Blossom. Decided Spanish soap operas were a better reflection of the human condition.

SHAWN:
Obviously he didn't write the Blossom where she adopted a chimp and hit the road in an 18-wheeler.

They walk over to LANCE who is sitting on a chair talking with a PA.

GUS:
That was BJ and the Bear, Shawn.

LANCE:
No! You tell them that line is cut. Don't listen to them, they're actors.

The PA leaves.

SHAWN:
Floyd Rothstein.

GUS:
(whispers) Lance.

SHAWN:
Lance Rothstein. You have a moment? We're big fans.

LANCE:
No, I don't have a moment. I don't mean to be rude. (stands) You have a head shot, just drop it off in the casting department right off the lobby. (picks up a cup of gummy bears) All right? (starts to walk away)

GUS:
No, sir, we're not actors.

SHAWN and GUS follow LANCE.

LANCE:
You're not?

SHAWN:
Furthest thing from it. I'm a psychic.

LANCE:
Well, I'm really, not interested in getting my fortune told, Mr..?

SHAWN:
Spencer. Shawn Spencer. This is my partner, Lavender Gooms. We're here with the police investigating the Nu√±ez case.

They stop walking.

GUS:
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Burton Guster. We were here yesterday at the crime scene, and we know that Jorge Gama-Lobo was not responsible for the death of Rinaldo Nu√±ez.

LANCE:
He wasn't?

GUS:
No.

LANCE:
Shocking! I know that. And I don't work with crystal balls. (puts down cup, clears throat and walks away)

SHAWN:
Make a note, I just let that go. It would have been way too easy.

SHAWN and GUS follow LANCE.

INT. TV STUDIO, HALL, DAY

LANCE:
Yeah, look, while we're talking here, a murderer is wandering around loose on my set, which is not comforting for someone with my weak constitution. I already have hereditary angina and shin splints. (stops and looks at SHAWN) Listen, are you sure that you are not an actor? Because you really do have a certain look.

GUS:
What? A shallow look?

LANCE:
(looks at watch and turns to leave) No, I have to go.

SHAWN:
Whoa, I still have some more questions.

LANCE:
Look, if I do not shoot this scene right now, then later in the week, we're gonna be doing this show live. Why don't you find me later on the set, all right? (turns to go)

SHAWN:
Okay, but what would really be helpful right now is if you just gave us Mr. Gama-Lobo's home address so that we could go there and interview him.

LANCE:
That is not necessary. The man has been doing this show eight years. His wife left him. This is his home address. (points to dressing room and leaves)

SHAWN walks over to the door and knocks on the frosted glass.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER strides through the station, JULIET at his side.

LASSITER:
"I'm sensing a hair in the evidence baggie." Man, it just irks me!

JULIET:
I still think we should bring in some of other cast members for questioning.

LASSITER:
Here's the thing, O'Hara. It's not that complicated. Motivation, opportunity, execution. With Nu√±ez out of the picture, Jorge's role on the show gets larger. Motivation. (snaps fingers) Knowing in advance that it's scripted that he would stab Nu√±ez presents opportunity.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER:
The fact that he was unmistakably caught on film actually stabbing the victim? Hello? Execution. Soon as we get those lab results back, we'll be done... (stops at front desk and takes file from officer) Thank you.

JULIET looks across to the opposite counter and sees a young female officer signing some paperwork.

JULIET:
Who's that?

LASSITER:
Pascaretti, Penny. A newbie. Just transferred in from the 302 out of Oakland.

JULIET:
It's about time. We could use some new blood.

LASSITER:
I hate new blood.

JULIET:
Of course you do. I welcome it, especially new female blood. It gets lonely here in this sea of testosterone.

LASSITER:
Well, you go right ahead, knock yourself out, make a new friend. Maybe you could have a little tea party, braid each other's hair for all I care.

JULIET shakes her head and walks around the desk to talk with PENNY.

JULIET:
Hello, I'm Detective O'Hara, but you can call me Juliet. (holds out hand but PENNY doesn't) Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself, and welcome you here, and let you know if you need any help with anything, don't hesitate to ask.

PENNY:
Does it look like I don't know how to write my own name and badge number?

LASSITER looks away and JULIET walks back around to him. They walk back down the hall.

LASSITER:
BFFs? Best friends forever?

JULIET:
Shut up, Lassiter.

INT. TV STUDIO, JORGE'S DRESSING ROOM, DAY

JORGE is packing things in boxes.

SHAWN:
Mr. Gama-Lobo, we just have a few questions for you.

JORGE:
(sits) Call me Jorge, please.

SHAWN:
Jorge? (laughs) Come on, that's a little silly. (GUS jabs him and he clears his throat) That's your name. That's cool. We know you didn't do it.

JORGE:
You do?

SHAWN:
We think you were framed.

JORGE:
Oh! (stands) This is music to my earlobes. Do you have questions for me?

GUS:
Yes, we do. Do you know if Serena's baby is yours?

JORGE:
What?

GUS:
Serena's baby...

SHAWN:
Gus! I'm sorry. Are those meatballs from craft service?

There is a Styrofoam container in the trash with two meatballs.

JORGE:
Yes. Yes. Kelly knows they are my favorite. Usually I hunger for her meatballs the way a jackal salivates for an injured possum, but, sadly I have no appetite for them now.

SHAWN:
(whispers to GUS) Grab the one doesn't have a fork in it.

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
They're still steaming a little...

GUS jabs SHAWN with his elbow and SHAWN spins around and notices a family photo on the wall.

SHAWN:
Whoa! Who's this over here?

JORGE:
That is my family. Yes, they are all back in Mexico. I left them to do the show.

SHAWN:
Your brother?

JORGE:
It's my sister.

GUS:
No, he means this person right here. (points to woman in photo with slight mustache)

JORGE:
Yes, yes. It's my sister.

GUS:
No, he means this one. Right here. (points with both index fingers) Where my finger is.

JORGE:
Yes, yes. It's my sister.

SHAWN:
She is quite lovely, in a young Keith Hernandez sort of... You must miss them very much.

JORGE:
Yes.

SHAWN sees the frame of the photo was cracked and hastily repaired. He also sees a crack running across the wall towards a spot that was patched with spackle.

SHAWN:
Oh! (staggers with a "vision") I sense violence. An altercation, here, in this room. (smacks the plastic head off a mannequin) Someone had something against you. Here!

JORGE:
Yes. Yes! Quintessa.

GUS:
Quintessa Gabrielle. She plays Corrine on the show. She is gorgeous.

JORGE:
You don't know her wrath. She hates me. She's like the Latina Susan Lucci. She beat me up.

GUS:
(scoffs) I hardly think there's woman capable of that.

SHAWN:
Bea Arthur.

GUS:
I stand corrected.

They hear shouts from outside and shattering glass.

SHAWN:
Excuse us.

SHAWN and GUS go into the hall.

INT. TV STUDIO, HALL, DAY

LANCE is standing outside of QUINTESSA'S dressing room.

LANCE:
Would you please just, just come out and talk to me?

QUINTESSA:
(muffled) Go away!

LANCE:
I promise you, I swear to you, I will change the line.

The dressing room door opens and we see QUINTESSA is a statuesque and buxom woman. SHAWN and GUS arrive.

LANCE:
I was misinformed. There's gotta be another Spanish word for nipple. Just tell me what it is.

QUINTESSA groans and throws a glass vase at him. LANCE ducks and it shatters against the wall. She calls him something in Spanish before striding away down the hall. LANCE straightens up and sees SHAWN and GUS watching.

LANCE:
Hi, how you doing? I'm just going to the writers' room where it's emotionally damaging, but it's physically safe. (walks past them)

SHAWN looks into QUINTESSA'S dressing room and sees underwear on the floor that matches those Nu√±ez had been wearing.

SHAWN:
Let's go after her. (starts to go after QUINTESSA)

GUS:
Whoa, whoa. (grabs SHAWN'S arms) Maybe now isn't the best time to approach her.

SHAWN:
You're right. We only have a day to solve the case. We should wait and hang out. (goes after QUINTESSA) I'll do the heavy lifting and charm her. You grab a piece of her hair.

GUS:
Grab a piece of her hair? Why?

SHAWN:
So we can compare it to the one on the murder weapon.

GUS:
How am I gonna grab a piece of her hair, Shawn?

EXT. TV STUDIO LOT, DAY

SHAWN and GUS hurry to catch up with QUINTESSA as she strides down the street.

QUINTESSA:
I don't know what else I can tell you. I told the policeman everything I know.

SHAWN:
Policeman?

Standing behind her, GUS reaches for her hair but she moves too quickly.

QUINTESSA:
Yes, the tall scurvy-like one with no rhythm.

GUS:
Detective Lassiter?

QUINTESSA:
Yes, that was his name. (brushes a hand against her hair)

SHAWN:
Were you and Rinaldo Nu√±ez close?

QUINTESSA:
Well, we were working together, but... but no, I didn't know him very well at all. I'm a professional.

GUS reaches for her hair again. He doesn't get anything and makes a face.

SHAWN:
I see. Was he ever in your dressing room?

QUINTESSA:
I should say not! (stops)

SHAWN:
That's strange. (grabs her hands and holds them to his forehead before lowering them to his chest) I'm seeing him in your dressing room.

QUINTESSA:
(pulls her hands away) Are you a psychic or some kind of witch? Okay. So, maybe sometimes he came to my dressing room to rehearse lines or something...

SHAWN:
No, he's not running lines. He's holding a feather duster, dipping himself in pancake batter. And he's quite naked.

QUINTESSA:
T√∫ eres un brujo! (walks away)

SHAWN:
Okay, so she's definitely boinking Nu√±ez. Does that make her a suspect?

GUS:
Well, she did lie about it. Why?

SHAWN:
Well, he does wear bikini briefs.

GUS:
Oh. (holds up a strand)

SHAWN:
Sweet. (takes it and looks at it) Dude, this isn't a hair.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
It's just part of her scrunchy. Look! It's all elastic-y. It's got a piece of bedazzle in it. It's made out of yarn. Good work, buddy. Forget it, I'll figure out how to pluck one myself. I think we should split up. You hit the props department, see what you can find out about our weapon. I'm gonna pop into the stage and grill Lance about the Quintessa-Jorge relationship. (chuckles) Jorge.

They go in opposite directions.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

The actress playing Serena comes down the stairs saying her lines. LANCE is sitting next to the DIRECTOR as they watch the monitors. SHAWN walks over and stands next to them.

DIRECTOR:
Camera two, push in. Hold it there. Go.

The doorbell rings as Serena walks to the door.

SHAWN:
So this is where all the magic happens?

DIRECTOR:
Yes. Smell the dream.

SHAWN:
(sniffs) Hey, can I ask you a question? I think...

LANCE:
Shh, shh.

SHAWN:
(whispers) I'm sorry. I'm just gonna watch.

On the set, a deliveryman named Chad has a package for Serena. As he delivers his lines, he keeps raising his eyebrows in an exaggerated fashion.

LANCE:
What the hell is he doing? What has he got? A twitch or something?

DIRECTOR:
I'm afraid that's called his acting.

LANCE:
He's only got a couple of lines. It's always the bit players.

SHAWN:
Is he flirting with her?

LANCE:
That was the idea.

SHAWN:
He should be more subtle than that, man. Like... You don't seduce a woman with your forehead and your Adam's apple. It's right here. (points to eyes) It's always been here. It doesn't start there, you know? I mean, (looks away from hand) you're over here and then... (turns back to look at fingers)

LANCE:
How would you do the line?

SHAWN:
Do... do what?

LANCE:
Just, you know. (tugs open SHAWN'S shirt)

SHAWN:
No, I can't, whoa, I just...

INT. PROP TRAILER, DAY

GUS is inside the cramped trailer with the PROP MASTER. He shows GUS the blades.

PROP:
Well, that's the thing. Jorge would never have known that the knife was real. The blades are virtually identical, actually. We build the prop as close to the specs of your average six-inch blade as we can.

GUS:
Mmm-mmm.

PROP:
I mean, we do that, obviously, for the look of the knife, but also it gives, like, a realistic feel for the actor, you know the size, the weight, the texture, so on.

GUS:
Ah.

PROP:
Here, you wanna hold it? (holds out knife) Go on, hold it.

GUS:
(takes knife) Huh. Feels real.

PROP:
But it's not. That's the fake one. See? The blade retracts, collapses right into the handle. (pushes on the blade)

GUS:
Ah.

PROP:
Hey, you wanna try it?

GUS:
No, I couldn't.

PROP:
Come on, stab me.

GUS:
No, really, I shouldn't.

PROP:
Come on! Go ahead. Hey, it's fun, trust me.

GUS:
All right. (stabs him in the stomach)

PROP:
Ah!

They both laugh.

PROP:
Just messing with you.

GUS:
Do you mind if I borrow this to show my partner? It's for the investigation.

GUS leaves the trailer with the prop knife.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

SHAWN stands by the set doorway testing it. He is holding a brown jacket over his arm. GUS hurries over with the prop knife.

GUS:
Okay, Shawn, this is what I found out so far. Turns out the knife may have changed hands up to six times before Nu√±ez was stabbed with it. The day is almost up and we've gotten nowhere. It could be anyone on this set. We need more access and more time.

SHAWN:
I think I've figured out a pretty good angle for that, buddy. I just need you to step aside for one second. Maybe hit the craft service table, grab us a couple of those potato latkes. I can't figure out how Kelly makes them so crispy.

GUS:
I'm not stepping anywhere, Shawn. Am I the only one doing any work here on this case?

SHAWN:
I'd love to go to work. I'm ready, I feel it. I just... I can't.

GUS:
Really? And why is that?

SHAWN:
(whispers) You're standing right in my eye line, buddy.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN nods and GUS turns around to see the actress playing Serena standing there. SHAWN puts on the brown jacket, having taken over the role of Chad.

DIRECTOR:
Quiet on the set!

GUS runs off the set.

DIRECTOR:
Four, three, two... and action.

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET enter the room. The actress who plays Serena is already sitting at the table.

LASSITER:
Thanks for coming into speak with us, Ms. Desmondo.

DESMONDO:
You're welcome.

LASSITER and JULIET sit down.

LASSITER:
I'm gonna get right to it. Can you recall any instances in which you witnessed Jorge Gama-Lobo engaging in violent behavior?

DESMONDO:
Yes.

JULIET:
Yes?

DESMONDO:
Yes.

LASSITER takes a pen from his pocket, anxious to write down her testimony.

LASSITER:
Please tell us.

DESMONDO:
It was seven years ago, when he pushed Diego Cabrera off a bridge in broad daylight.

LASSITER:
Wait, that happened in this state? When was he charged?

DESMONDO:
He wasn't. He beat the rap, but there was an eye witness, his thought-to-be-missing step brother, Juan Sandoval.

LASSITER:
Sandoval, that sounds familiar. McNab, get in here!

McNAB enters the room.

LASSITER:
I need you to run all information on a Juan Sandoval.

McNAB:
Juan Sandoval? (looks as DESMONDO in realization) Wasn't he your common law husband?

LASSITER:
Wait, he was your husband?

McNAB:
Common law. But you murdered him by freezing his body and then shipping it to Hawaii, and defrosting it by a volcano.

DESMONDO:
Exactly. That was fifth season, episode eleven.

McNAB:
I'm a fan.

LASSITER:
Are you two talking about the show? I'm talking about a real murder.

JULIET:
I actually saw that episode. But he came back in season six, right? As the chief surgeon, so that he could change Thelma's face to look like your face so that you could take the rap for Beatrice's murder! (giggles) It's the only episode I saw.

LASSITER:
Who writes this crap?

DESMONDO:
The writers are all so colorful and brilliant. They're wonderful with the brutal crimes. They are some kind of geniuses, I swear.

LASSITER:
Some kind of murder geniuses maybe.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

Over the monitor we see SHAWN enter through the doorway and deliver his lines as CHAD to CORRINE in Spanish. He is now dressed in the full delivery uniform with the brown jacket, khaki shirt and shorts.

CHAD:
I have a package for you...special delivery. It says...'handle with care'.

CORRINE exhales and reaches out her hand for the package. CHAD tosses the package and clipboard aside and moves in to kiss CORRINE passionately. His hands are everywhere. LANCE and the DIRECTOR are watching.

LANCE:
He's really got something, am I right?

DIRECTOR:
Yes, he's my muse.

SHAWN gets carried away and dips QUINTESSA. She exclaims as he nearly drops her.

DIRECTOR:
Cut!

SHAWN pulls QUINTESSA up to stand.

QUINTESSA:
See! That's what happens when you hire people off the street. (walks off set)

SHAWN:
(walks over to GUS) She's sweet, sweet like Mariah Carey on a bender. How'd that look?

GUS:
Okay. Don't take this the wrong way, but I think it lacked some passion.

SHAWN:
Passion?

GUS:
Yes.

SHAWN:
Do you have any idea how many pages we shot today? 83. And I'm getting by with the Spanish I learned from Charo on Love Boat. Plus I gotta make it look passionate and look for clues? Don't get me wrong, I'm pulling it off quite nicely. I got a hair off Quintessa's head because our dressing rooms, side by side.

GUS:
Nice.

LASSITER walks onto the set.

LASSITER:
How many times do you two need to be told you are not needed on this case? You are wasting the department's resources.

SHAWN watches as a PA holding a cup of coffee flips through an old script and tosses it into a bin.

LASSITER:
Hey, pal, please escort these two off the premises.

PA:
Well, uh...

LASSITER:
"Uh" is not an action word. Now drop the joe and take them out of here.

PA:
Well, actually, this coffee's for Mr. Spencer. (hands SHAWN the cup)

SHAWN:
Thank you, Roger. (takes cup and drinks from it)

LASSITER:
Mr. Spencer?

ROGER:
Well, uh, Chad, I guess. (walks away)

LASSITER:
Hunh?

KELLY walks up with a Styrofoam food container.

KELLY:
Here, these pineapple Peking dumplings are special for you, Chad.

SHAWN:
Thank you, Kelly, you sweet little thing.

SHAWN passes the container to GUS as KELLY walks away. At that moment, LASSITER turns and sees a cast chair with SHAWN'S name on it.

LASSITER:
No. No, no, no, no.

ROGER comes back and stands beside LASSITER.

ROGER:
I'm going to have to ask you to leave the stage area. We're about to roll. (puts a hand on LASSITER'S arm)

LASSITER:
You don't wanna touch me.

SHAWN:
Roger, it's okay.

ROGER leaves.

SHAWN:
Before you go... (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a plastic bag) You might want to send this down to your boys at the lab. It's a hair off Quintessa Gabrielle's head. The same color and length as the one found on the murder weapon. I think you'll find it's a sweet, sweet match.

LASSITER:
(opens bag) Oh, yes. I'll get right on that. (blows away hair) Oops.

SHAWN:
Why would you do that?

LASSITER:
The hair from the knife was synthetic. It came from a wig. Quintessa Gabrielle's hair is real so there's no match. But, nice work, Chad. (gives SHAWN the bag and walks away)

INT. TV STUDIO, WRITERS' ROOM, DAY

LANCE is sitting at the head of the table surrounded by other writers. He has his feet up on the table. The table is covered with take-out containers and soda cans.

LANCE:
What kind of show do you think we're doing? Gotta keep it grounded, you gotta keep it real. Wanna go back to being an intern?

LASSITER enters the room.

LASSITER:
Lance Rothstein.

LANCE:
Excuse me, I am doing something here. Not nothing. (to writers) She's already making love to her nephew. She can't also be a nun. (to LASSITER) Yes, can I help you? Very quickly.

LASSITER:
(pulls document from jacket pocket) I have a warrant to search these premises, confiscate all scripts and written material.

LANCE:
On what grounds?

LASSITER:
On the grounds you've all been very busy thinking up ingenious ways to kill people.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

HENRY grabs the TV remote and settles back on the couch.

HENRY:
Ah. (switches on the TV and kicks off his shoes)

MAN ON TV:
All that, plus the latest in local sports with Dan the man, coming up at 11:00 P.M.

On the TV, the doorbell rings and SERENA answers the door. We only see the back of CHAD.

CHAD:
The package is for you, Mrs... Lourdes.

The angle changes and HENRY sees SHAWN.

SERENA:
It's Ms, please.

HENRY:
(leans forward) What the hell?

CHAD:
Well, in that case...sign here.

As SERENA signs, CHAD watches seductively. HENRY stares at the TV, completely stunned.

INT. HOSPITAL, HALL, DAY

JULIET and LASSITER hurry down the hall.

JULIET:
Jorge Gama-Lobo tried to kill himself?

LASSITER:
Tried and failed. Must have been so wracked with guilt over stabbing Nu√±ez, he decided to off himself.

JULIET:
Did he leave a note?

LASSITER:
Oh, yeah, admitting to the murder. It's already with the boys down at the lab. I just wanted to get in there, get a verbal confession.

JULIET points and they enter the room.

INT. HOSPITAL, ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are sitting at JORGE'S bedside.

LASSITER:
You've got to be kidding me. (strides over to the bed) Step away from the bed now!

SHAWN and GUS shush LASSITER.

LASSITER:
Don't you shush me!

SHAWN:
I was about to say there's still time for you to go downstairs to the gift shop and buy something.

GUS:
Maybe a teddy bear.

SHAWN:
Oh, that's nice. Teddy bears are cute. They have one with a jar of honey that says, "bee well".

LASSITER:
I mean it, this time I will arrest you for interfering in police business.

A NURSE enters the room.

NURSE:
I'm gonna have to ask you two to leave. This man is very sick, and I need quiet in here.

LASSITER:
Us?

JULIET:
Excuse me, I'm Detective O'Hara and this is Detective Lassiter and we're investigating this man.

LASSITER:
And I demand you remove these men from this room.

NURSE:
Honey, the only people actually authorized to be in here are Mr. Spencer and Mr. Guster. They're on Mr. Gama-Lobo's friends and family list. Everyone else out.

LASSITER:
You just met him a week ago.

SHAWN:
His whole family is back in Mexico. His older brother misses him very much.

GUS:
His sister.

SHAWN:
Right.

JULIET:
How does he make friends so fast?

JULIET and LASSITER leave.

GUS:
I get that Jorge was depressed about being off the show, but murder/suicide/coma? This whole thing is starting to feel like a real soap opera to me. I can't believe he would take his own life.

SHAWN sees lighter strands in JORGE'S hair and leans forward.

SHAWN:
Unless he was wearing a wig, he didn't. Someone else did.

There is dramatic music like right before a commercial break.

GUS:
What? I don't get it.

SHAWN:
Really? I thought I wrapped it up so nicely for you just now. It felt really good, it was organic. (clears throat, stands and pulls away the strands) Synthetic hair. Just like the one found on the knife.

More dramatic music.

GUS:
So?

SHAWN:
Dude, it means the same person was there when Jorge tried to kill himself. He wasn't alone.

More music.

GUS:
So, wait, you're saying he didn't try to kill himself?

SHAWN:
I can't do this. (walks away)

GUS:
You're not being clear, Shawn. (follows)

SHAWN:
Come on, dude. I gave it to you three different ways.

GUS:
Did he or did he not try to kill himself?

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

LASSITER is sitting at the table searching through the scripts. There is a plate with some lunch remains. JULIET enters the room.

LASSITER:
Is that the Gama-Lobo suicide note?

JULIET:
(sits at the table) Yes, but I'm still waiting on the handwriting samples from the lab.

LASSITER:
Nah, forget that. Just read it to me. (closes eyes and rests hand over his face)

JULIET:
Okay. (reads) "Dear world, I ask for forgiveness for the sins I have committed against humanity. It was my hands that carried out a heinous murder."

LASSITER:
(opens eyes) Wait a minute, hold on a second. I know that.

JULIET:
You know that?

LASSITER:
I have been literally poring over these things for days. (stands and sorts through scripts) Hold on a second. (finds what he wants, sits back down and finds the page) Okay, continue.

JULIET:
"How can I go back and reverse time?"

BOTH:
"I have no choice but to say good-bye to a world I turned my back on and the woman I betrayed."

JULIET:
Wow, it's from a script?

LASSITER:
Word for word. Written by Lance Rothstein. (shows the title page to JULIET)

JULIET:
So Lance set him up.

LASSITER:
Mmm-hmm.

JULIET:
What, did he just get lazy? Did he think no one would remember?

LASSITER:
He's gonna have plenty of time to figure out new plot lines behind bars.

LASSITER grabs his jacket and the two leave the room.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

SHAWN and LANCE are on either side of a wire window. They are each holding a telephone handset. It's a prison visitation set.

LANCE:
So this is what it feels like to be in jail. I always wondered if I'd survive.

SHAWN:
I was in jail once.

LANCE:
Really? This is what it was like for you too?

SHAWN:
(looks around) Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. You know, I mean, these phones aren't real.

LANCE:
No, course not. I mean, you know, it would be too expensive. But I mean for Ernesto's prison scene tomorrow, it's great, right?

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

JULIET and LASSITER arrive.

LASSITER:
Lance Rothstein, you're under arrest.

LANCE:
For what?

JULIET:
The murder of Rinaldo Nu√±ez.

SHAWN:
(still talking into fake phone) Don't worry, I can get you off on that one.

LASSITER:
And the attempted murder of Jorge Gama-Lobo.

SHAWN:
Ooh, I don't know about that one.

LANCE hangs up the phone and looks over to JULIET and LASSITER before turning back to SHAWN. SHAWN places one hand up against the window and LANCE puts his hand up against it.

INT. SBPD, LOWER HALL, DAY

PENNY is sitting at a desk at the base of the stairs. JULIET comes down to talk to her. She is holding a cupcake.

JULIET:
Don't get up. I'm not staying. We just had a huge break in that murder case I was working on, so now the paperwork. I just wanted to stop by and give you this. (sets the cupcake on the desk)

PENNY:
What is that?

JULIET:
A cupcake.

PENNY:
I can see that but why are you giving it to me?

JULIET:
I noticed that you were eating one with your lunch the other day, so I stopped and bought you one. Same kind. Red velvet.

PENNY:
You, um, you noticed what I was eating.

JULIET:
Well, yeah, I'm a detective. I notice details.

PENNY:
Really? What else did you notice about me?

JULIET:
Well, I noticed that you eat by yourself every day. I noticed that you hesitate to make eye contact with people, and, well, you can be a little abrasive. But, you know, that's probably just because it's hard to adapt, you know, lots of politics. It's hard to understand where everyone's coming from.

PENNY:
Don't worry. I think I'm getting a pretty good idea.

JULIET:
Good. I'm glad. (smiles and walks away)

EXT. TV STUDIO, LOT, DAY

Out by the trailers, fans are lined up behind a barrier, calling to the stars. Ms DESMONDO gives some autographs. SHAWN comes out in costume, a cloth around his face to protect the clothes from makeup. He's eating a sandwich. HENRY is waiting for him.

SHAWN:
Dad! You're here!

HENRY:
I am.

SHAWN:
You have to try this sandwich. Kelly from craft service makes them for me.

HENRY:
I already ate lunch, Shawn. Why am I here?

SHAWN:
This isn't lunch. This is turkey with stuffing and cranberry. It's like Thanksgiving between two slices of bread. This whole place is like Leaving Las Vegas with food.

They start to walk between the trailers.

HENRY:
Shawn, why'd you ask me here?

SHAWN:
I thought you'd enjoy it. You said you never had the opportunity to visit me when I was working a real job, and now I have a real job!

HENRY:
Shawn, this is not a real job.

SHAWN:
Sure it is. Oh no, I think I got make-up on this t-shirt. Has anyone seen Ivan?

HENRY:
Acting is not a real job, Shawn. I mean, how much attention do you need?

SHAWN:
I'm not doing this for the attention. (stops and poses with a family in their photo and continues on) I happen to be solving a case. A murder. This is serious business.

SHAWN and HENRY stop where the fans can see them.

SHAWN:
I've got a guy sitting in jail. Lassiter's got some evidence against him, but I know he didn't do it. It doesn't make any sense. He's a writer. He's got no motive.

HENRY:
Well, motive is everything. No motive, no conviction.

WOMAN:
Chad! Chad, over here!

HENRY:
How do you have fans? This is asinine. You started on the show five days ago.

SHAWN:
(waves to fans) Look, I have something.

HENRY:
Did you ever think that maybe this is embarrassing for me?

SHAWN:
Embarrassing for you?

HENRY:
First off, your accent is terrible. It's disgraceful, really. You sound like that El Pollo Loco guy. And then, there you go, turning your back on Rinaldo even after he defended you when you were accused of Maria's kidnapping. Come on.

SHAWN:
First of all, I am trying to sound like the El Pollo Loco guy. And secondly, Rinaldo turned his back on me when he slept with Maria in the first place.

HENRY:
Oh, come on, he would have given you half the reward money! Where's your integrity? It makes you look like such a bad person.

SHAWN:
I'm Shawn. Those are things that my character Chad did. I play him on TV. It's Shawn. Shawny.

HENRY sighs.

SHAWN:
Look into your boy's eyes. (puts a hand on HENRY'S shoulder) It's me, Papa.

HENRY:
(shoves SHAWN'S hand away) Don't be an idiot! I'm not one of your fans. I barely even like you.

SHAWN:
That's it. If my own father can blur the lines between the show and reality, why couldn't someone else? We've been looking in the wrong place. It's fans.

HENRY:
Okay, so you've narrowed it down to 150 suspects. Good work, Shawn.

MAN:
I want your baby! I want your baby!

SHAWN:
I don't have any female fans?

INT. PRISON, DAY

In an eerie sense of d√©j√† vu, LANCE is sitting on one side of a window talking into a phone to SHAWN. This time GUS is with him. They are holding the phone between them.

SHAWN:
Listen, Lance, Lassiter doesn't have enough to make this arrest stick. He's just hoping that a couple nights in jail will get you to confess.

LANCE:
A couple nights? No, no, no, no. Here's the thing. I actually like it in here. This is fuel for the show. It's fuel for me. I always felt there was something holding me back as a writer. I grew up in Beverly Hills. And I always felt that I lacked any real-life experience. Shawn, this is so good for me. It's like Hemmingway, like Ellroy, Steinbeck, Danielle Steele.

SHAWN:
Ethan Hawke.

GUS:
Judy Blume.

LANCE:
Exactly. I can wallow in the harsh underbelly of prison life and shake it up a little bit with the riff-raff.

GUS:
Uh, the riff-raff? This is the Santa Barbara jail, not San Quentin.

SHAWN:
It was written up in Fodor's last year as a nice spa alternative.

GUS:
We need to get you out of here so you can write the show. Everyone needs you.

LANCE:
No, no, no, I can write in here. I can scratch it out with a broken piece of lead in the dark. And then I can bury myself in the one non-down pillow they issued me and I can cry myself to sleep.

SHAWN:
Look, we need to talk about (heavy accent) Corrine.

LANCE:
Colleen?

SHAWN:
(accent) Corrine!

LANCE:
Oh, Corrine.

SHAWN:
Yes, it came to me in a vision. The murderer is doing this to protect her. Think about it. First, Ernesto cheated on her and was stabbed and killed. Then you wrote that Vincente betrayed her and went missing. Someone took it into their own hands and tried to kill him.

GUS:
Well, not Vincente, but Jorge.

SHAWN:
That's my point. They can't tell the difference. It's a fan.

LANCE:
That's interesting. I'm not disagreeing, but what's act two? I mean, let's say it is just one fan. How you gonna find one fan among thousands?

SHAWN:
Easy. That's where you come in. You just write me a storyline where I put Corrine's life in jeopardy. Then we won't have to go looking for the murderer. The murderer will come looking for me.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK is sitting at her desk having lunch while watching the soap as CORRINE slaps CHAD.

CHAD:
Ow! Again? Why?

CORRINE slaps him again. JULIET knocks on the open door.

JULIET:
You wanted to see me, Chief?

VICK:
Oh. Mmm. (switches off the TV)

JULIET:
Is there a problem? Did the Rothstein arrest not stick?

VICK:
This isn't about the Nu√±ez case. (motions for JULIET to sit) This is about the new transfer, Penny Pascaretti. Wanted to hear your side.

JULIET:
My side? My side of what?

VICK:
Well, I don't know a delicate way to put this. Ms. Pascaretti has filed an interdepartmental harassment charge against you.

JULIET:
What? That's outrageous!

VICK:
Is there any truth to this claim?

JULIET:
I was just being nice, reaching out. I bought her a cupcake. Sue me.

VICK:
She is. What do you mean you bought her a cupcake? With this piece of information, you're lucky the charge didn't include a stalking claim.

JULIET:
I was just trying to make a friend.

VICK:
I'm going to give you a piece of advice, and take it. As a woman in this department, you have to be very careful how you go about forming friendships. Women in the line of police work are more cautious by nature and necessity, and slow to trust.

JULIET:
Well, if that's the case, I guess no woman has a friend in the department.

VICK:
That's right.

JULIET:
Oh... 'Cause I kind of thought we were friends.

VICK:
Well, you were wrong. I'll talk to Ms. Pascaretti and see what I can do to mitigate these charges. But in the meantime, stop buying pastries. You're excused.

JULIET stands and slowly walks to the door.

VICK:
Nice blouse.

JULIET:
Thanks. I got it at Nordstrom, (starts walking back) it was on the sale rack. I probably shouldn't have...

VICK:
I don't care.

JULIET:
But you asked.

VICK:
Enough, O'Hara. Goodbye.

JULIET smiles as she leaves the office. VICK turns the TV back on and continues her lunch. CHAD and CORRINE kiss passionately.

INT. PRISON, DAY

SHAWN:
We have a problem.

GUS:
The show's fallen behind. And the network says the only way we can stay on schedule is if we do the show on Friday, live.

SHAWN:
Which means we need a script tonight! Is that possible?

LANCE:
Are you kidding me? I've never been more inspired in my life.

SHAWN:
Sweet! Here's the catch. Now that you've had me cheat on Corrine, I need you to put out new pages, with a new murder weapon and a scene where Corrine comes after me.

LANCE:
That's a terrible pitch. Why would I do that?

SHAWN:
Because, Lance, the murderer's going to try and finish the job. Whoever it is has access to the scripts and will be paying very close attention to the murder weapon and will likely tamper with it tomorrow. But I'll be there to catch them.

LANCE takes a shortened pencil from behind his ear and nods.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET walk over to SHAWN and GUS.

LASSITER:
All right, Spencer, I trust you're confident this elaborate charade is going to be fruitful for the case?

SHAWN:
(sitting in his chair) Confidence is not my problem. Dry lips, however... (turns to makeup girl) Pearl, make it nice for the kissers.

Pearl touches up his lips with a little gloss. ROGER walks over.

ROGER:
Mr. Spencer, we're ready for you on set. We're moments away from going live.

LASSITER and JULIET walk over to the sidelines. SHAWN walks to his mark and GUS walks with him.

GUS:
Okay, so what's our plan?

SHAWN:
Well, Lance wrote this long monologue for Corrine after my exit. That gives me plenty of time to make my costume change, so I'll meet you backstage then. Keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious.

GUS:
Got it.

ROGER:
We're seconds away from live! Places, everybody, places! In four, three, two...

DIRECTOR:
And go!

On the set, CHAD leans against the bannister at the base of the stairs, a drink in his hands. CORRINE walks down the stairs in a shimmering orange evening gown.

CHAD:
Wow! Darling, you looking lovely but we should get going if we are going to make it to Serena's charity ball.

CHAD starts up the stairs.

INT. PRISON, WEIGHT ROOM, DAY

LANCE is watching the show on a small mounted TV. There are three other inmates with him.

CORRINE:
Tell me, Chad, do I look fat in this ball gown?

CHAD:
You look like a sweet nectarine wrapped in taffeta. (strikes heroic pose)

LANCE:
I didn't write that.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

QUINTESSA:
(whispers) Improvisation. I like it.

SHAWN:
(with accent) Yes.

CORRINE:
Well, I need you to be a dear and after you get your suit on will you grab my nail gun?

CHAD:
What? You're taking a nail gun to Serena's charity ball?

CORRINE:
No, silly. The shelf has been loose for a while now and I need to fix it.

CHAD:
But now my little rabbit? (checks watch)

CORRINE:
Yes. Be a love, and look for it in the garage.

CHAD:
Okay. (goes upstairs)

CORRINE raises an eyebrow.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

HENRY is stretched out on the couch watching the show.

HENRY:
Oh, this can't be good.

INT. STUDIO, BACKSTAGE, DAY

SHAWN hurries down the steps, taking off his jacket. He ducks behind a changing screen. GUS is standing there eating and watching a monitor.

SHAWN:
Dude, did anyone come near the prop table?

GUS:
What prop table? I've been glued to the TV, watching for anything suspicious to happen, like you said.

SHAWN:
Dude, you're just standing there eating a meatball, watching the show. You're supposed to be watching the prop table!

GUS:
(walks over to SHAWN) You never said anything about a prop table, Shawn. If you'd said "Watch the prop table", I would have been watching the prop table.

SHAWN:
(changes into a dress shirt and tie) Whoever tampered with that nail gun is our killer, Gus. We're talking about my life here!

GUS:
I know, Shawn. This woman is crazy. She's gonna kill you.

On the TV, CORRINE is on the phone.

SHAWN:
Look, forget it, okay? Just forget it. (puts on jacket) I'll check the nail gun myself. Do me a favor, and save me one of those meatballs, yeah?

ROGER comes over with the nail gun.

ROGER:
Let's go. You gotta get out there.

SHAWN:
This is no time for pranks, Roger. There's still half a scene before I make my entrance.

ROGER:
Not anymore. She's all over the place. She just skipped ahead three pages. (hands SHAWN the nail gun) You're on!

SHAWN:
Gus?

GUS:
Be strong, Shawn. (turns to the monitor)

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

CHAD enters from the top of the stairs as thunder rumbles. CORRINE is on the phone.

CORRINE:
... he will be dead. (ends call)

CHAD comes down the stairs and CORRINE sees him.

CORRINE:
Oh! There you are, my dear. Here, hand me the nail gun.

SHAWN breaks away from being CHAD and speaks in heavily accented English.

SHAWN:
Okay. Here you go. But do not point this at me, because es mucho dangerioso.

SHAWN refuses to let go of the nail gun and QUINTESSA - still in character - tries to pull it away from him.

CORRINE:
I know that, my darling.

SHAWN:
You say that you know, but seriously. Be very carefulio. You could muerte me with this thing because it is realio as it gets!

QUINTESSA gets the nail gun.

QUINTESSA:
(whispers) I love the improv. The passion.

SHAWN:
(whispers) It's not an improv! (makes a slashing motion across his throat)

CORRINE:
(aims the nail gun at CHAD) Of course it's real as real as you cheating on me with my sister Serena and getting her pregnant.

GUS:
Shawn is the father of Serena's baby!

SHAWN:
(whispers in real voice) Please put that down, woman, it's loaded with real nails!

CORRINE:
And it's you that killed Vincente.

GUS:
Shawn, watch out! Watch out!

QUINTESSA fires the gun and SHAWN ducks behind the sofa as nails land in the wall behind him. SHAWN looks over the back of the sofa and sees that KELLY is the only one not paying attention. He also sees a mark along her hairline.

SHAWN:
(stands and speaks in heavily accented English) No! You are wrong! I am not a murderer-o! But I know who is-o. Yes. Your twin sister.

CORRINE:
I don't have a twin sister.

SHAWN:
Yes, what I mean is, it's someone who wants to be your twin sister. Someone who wants to be you!

INT. PRISON, WEIGHT ROOM, DAY

LANCE:
I definitely did not write this.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

QUINTESSA:
Okay, I don't get it.

SHAWN:
No, it's like, eh... Beautiful girls...drinking... beer on the beach...

DIRECTOR:
My God, he's improvising.

SHAWN:
... with... homicide... I can't do this! Uh, you make a translation for me, yeah? (whispers in QUINTESSA'S ear)

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

HENRY'S eating a sandwich.

HENRY:
Ah, high school Spanish comes back to haunt him.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

SHAWN pulls away from QUINTESSA.

QUINTESSA:
She did it! (points)

DIRECTOR:
Pan over. Pan over!

Camera 2 pans over to KELLY.

SHAWN:
(normal voice) After all that, you just point at the murderer? Don't you have any sense of dramatic tension or build? Come on, what are we, on Blossom? No! You start by saying she was your biggest fan. You know, that she practically worships you. She read all the scripts. I got this, I got this... (accent) You! Yes, you! You hated it whenever Corinne was put into jeopardy. So you took it up on yourself to avenge her.

KELLY:
I had to. She cares too much. Her heart is too big for her chest.

SHAWN looks at QUINTESSA'S chest and shakes his head in disagreement.

KELLY:
(slowly walks forward) When Ernesto cheated on her, she was too weak to stand up for herself. I needed to help her. She was like my best friend.

QUINTESSA:
(to SHAWN) I barely spoke to her.

SHAWN:
(accent) Really? So it was you who replaced the retractable prop knife with the real one!

KELLY:
And he deserved it.

SHAWN:
(accent) And it was also you who poisoned poor Vincente after it was written that he betrayed Corinne.

QUINTESSA:
But how?

SHAWN:
(accent) With a meatball.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

KELLY poisons the meatballs.

JORGE: (v.o.)
Usually I hunger for her meat balls the way a jackal salivates for an injured possum.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

QUINTESSA:
But he wrote a suicide note.

SHAWN:
(accent) No, he didn't. You should have a degree in being wrong all the time. And she almost got away with it, if it was not for the hairs.

KELLY reaches for her hair.

QUINTESSA:
The hairs?

SHAWN:
(accent) Yes, the hairs. From the cheap imitation wig that you put on to emulate Corinne when you committed these murders!

KELLY:
Yes, I did it!

Everyone watching gasps.

KELLY:
And now it's your turn to die.

SHAWN:
Say what?

KELLY:
For sleeping with Serena when all Corinne did was love you.

GUS:
She's right about that.

KELLY runs at QUINTESSA and grabs the gun. QUINTESSA hides behind SHAWN as KELLY fires the nail gun. LASSITER and

JULIET rush her and try to take away the gun as it fires.

LASSITER:
Easy, you psycho! Put it down. Let go!

JULIET gets the nail gun and LASSITER restrains KELLY. QUINTESSA slides down SHAWN'S leg striking a romance novel pose. LASSITER and JULIET realize they are on camera.

LASSITER:
(in stilted Spanish) Hello. My name is...Inspector Carlton Lassiter. I like cheese.

JULIET smiles woodenly until the cameras go off.

JULIET:
Really? That's what you choose to say? (heads off set)

LASSITER:
(follows with KELLY) I only took it for two years in junior high. Watch out.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

GUS, SHAWN and HENRY are sitting on HENRY'S couch watching TV. SHAWN is holding a pillow in front of him, arms crossed over it. On the show CORRINE, SERENA and VINCENTE walk up to a well. VINCENTE is carrying a rolled carpet, duct taped closed. He drops it in the well. HENRY looks at SHAWN and then back to the TV.

VINCENTE:
It had to be done.

CORRINE:
I will miss him.

SERENA:
But you tried to kill him.

INT. TV STUDIO, SET, DAY

CORRINE:
Yes. But... I'll love him the rest of my life.

They look down into the water as it bubbles. VINCENTE walks away. CORRINE waves her handkerchief before holding it to her face as she walks away crying. She and SERENA wrap an arm around each other as they leave. We then see hands reaching out and CHAD breaks the surface gasping and panting. He looks up and smiles crookedly.

Episode 2x14 Dis-Lodged

Wow, only a month! There will be a delay before starting the next due to Doctor Who and Thanksgiving.



1987

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

HENRY enters the house through the kitchen. He is still in uniform and stops on the stairs when he hears SHAWN and GUS chanting from the other room. He goes into the living room.

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS have made a makeshift tent and HENRY can see their shadows cast on the sheet. HENRY tosses his bag to the floor and walks over to the tent and throws the sheet up to reveal the boys. They each have a towel tied around their necks like a cape. They have a camp stove between them, its flames flickering.

HENRY:
Hey. What the hell is going on here?

SHAWN:
Uh, nothing.

GUS:
Yeah.

HENRY:
Oh. My mistake. Sorry, guys.

SHAWN:
That's okay. See you later, Dad.

HENRY walks away before turning back and sitting cross-legged on the floor by the boys.

HENRY:
Okay, Shawn...out with it. (turns off the camp stove)

GUS:
We're starting a secret club.

HENRY:
The Burn Down the House Club?

GUS:
The Gus and Shawn club.

SHAWN:
It's actually the Shawn and Gus club.

HENRY:
You know, a club needs regulations, by-laws. You guys got any rules?

GUS:
Yes, no girls.

SHAWN:
And everybody has to be under 12. No old guys.

GUS:
And they have to have a love of correct grammar.

SHAWN:
That's not a rule!

GUS:
You said we could have one special rule. That's mine.

SHAWN:
And that's the best rule you could think of?

GUS:
I think you mean that's the best rule of which you could think.

SHAWN:
I'm not being in a club with this. (gets up and leaves)

GUS:
Fine, I don't need you and your misplaced prepositions. (looks at HENRY) Wanna be in a club?

PRESENT DAY

EXT. RESTAURANT, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are sitting at a table outside facing the street and the water beyond that.

SHAWN:
Dude, I feel like the weight of the world is off my shoulders. One phone call, and my mountain man trip with my dad is off.

GUS:
Why'd he back out?

SHAWN:
He was sick. He sounded horrible. He was lurching, he was coughing. He even sounded pale.

GUS:
How do you sound pale?

SHAWN:
I don't know. Maybe he didn't sound pale, but he definitely sounded feverish.

They hear a radio blaring "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown" and HENRY stops his truck in front of the restaurant. HENRY doesn't realize SHAWN and GUS are there as he taps his fingers to the music and rocks in his seat. GUS laughs and SHAWN looks at him. HENRY drives away. SHAWN stands and watches him go.

GUS:
Maybe he's driving himself to the hospital.

The waitress brings their food and leaves.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
You know what this means?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
We gotta go.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
There's no time to discuss. (starts to walk away) Oh, Gus. Uh, pay. (runs off)

GUS:
Shawn! (sighs in frustration and reaches for wallet)

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS watch from the Echo as HENRY pulls up in front of a large mock-Tudor building. GUS has managed to bring along his sandwich and dipping sauce.

GUS:
I still don't see why you're so uptight. 30 seconds ago you were thrilled your dad bailed on you.

SHAWN:
That's when I thought he was dying. (turns off car, releases seatbelt and turns to watch HENRY)

HENRY gets out and talks with the security guard.

GUS:
Dude. Do you realize where we are right now? That's the Monarch Lodge.

HENRY does the secret handshake with the guard before entering.

GUS:
Your dad's a member? Are you kidding me?

SHAWN:
We're going in. (gets out of the car)

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN walks around past GUS' window.

GUS:
You can't just walk into the Monarch Lodge. They're a clandestine society.

SHAWN says nothing, just points at GUS before walking away.

GUS:
They have a secret handshake.

EXT. LODGE, DAY

SHAWN does the secret handshake with the guard, naming the moves as he does them.

SHAWN:
Fold it, fold it, skim it, crouching tiger, zookeeper's boy, hairdresser on fire, girlfriend in a coma and then slap it on a biscuit.

GUS throws away the remains of his sandwich and wrapper. He goes to follow SHAWN and the guard reaches out his hand as GUS passes.

SHAWN:
You might not want to do that. Dr. Guster just inseminated an Appaloosa. All the way up to the elbow.

GUS:
No time to wash up. Thank you. (hands guard the dip dish)

SHAWN:
You're a good man.

SHAWN and GUS enter the lodge.

INT. MONARCH LODGE, HALL, DAY

The dark wood-paneled walls are lined with portraits of past members of the Lodge. SHAWN is looking at President Harry Truman.

GUS:
I've always wanted to see the inside of this place. (looks at an older portrait of a man with a handlebar mustache) Oscar Landon Clark. He started the Santa Barbara Mirror.

SHAWN:
(looks at the portrait of a balding man) Dude, Moby's a Monarch!

GUS:
That's not Moby, Shawn. (sees a portrait of an older man with round eyeglass frames) Martin A Turner, the city's first Postmaster. Can you believe this?

SHAWN:
I'm pretty sure that's Chuck from The Wonder Years.

SHAWN and GUS continue to look at the portraits until one stuns them.

GUS:
Dude!

SHAWN:
Oh, my God. That is really disturbing.

The portrait is of a younger HENRY looking rather creepy.

HENRY:
(muffled from another room) Jeez, what are you doing? Come on, Ted. Dragging me all the way over here for this?

They follow the sound of HENRY'S voice.

INT. MONARCH LODGE, MAIN ROOM, DAY

SHAWN:
(strides in) Dad, you owe me an explanation...

SHAWN notices room filled with men in hooded robes. They walk towards HENRY who stands out in one of his loud shirts. He then looks down on the floor at a dead body. SHAWN sees a powdery residue around the man's mouth and nose.

SHAWN:
(looks at HENRY) What the hell are you into?

INT. MONARCH LODGE, MAIN ROOM, DAY

HENRY walks over to one of the members, the one who called him in, TED.

HENRY:
You need to call the police.

TED:
We did. A policeman and a brother.

HENRY:
Ted, I'm retired. From both. S.B.P.D. (takes out phone) Here, I'll dial for you. Let's go. (takes him out of the room)

SHAWN:
This is unbelievable.

GUS:
Practically every doctor in the city is a member here. Do you realize what this means?

SHAWN:
Yes, it means my dad, Mr. Integrity, is nothing more than a lying liar from Liarsburg.

GUS:
(taps SHAWN on the arm and points to one of the men) That's Dr. Downs. He has a huge practice on the mesa, and he just dumped his rep. I've been trying to get in there for years. I'll be right back. (makes to head over)

SHAWN:
(stops GUS) Don't step on the corpse head.

GUS skirts around the body. HENRY re-enters the room and hits SHAWN on the arm.

HENRY:
How'd you get in here?

SHAWN:
I think I should ask you the same thing, sick faker! Let me feel your forehead. (reaches out a hand)

HENRY:
(ducks out of the way) What are you doing, following me around? I don't have time for this, Shawn. Take a look, there's a dead body in the room.

SHAWN:
Yes, Mr Arthur Holmstrom. He was murdered.

EXT. STREET, DAY

LASSITER is parked and JULIET enters the car with coffee for the two of them.

INT. LASSITER'S CAR, DAY

JULIET hands LASSITER his coffee.

JULIET:
Three creams, four sugars.

LASSITER:
Thank you.

JULIET:
And here's this. (hands LASSITER his money)

LASSITER:
What's this?

JULIET:
Yours didn't cost anything.

LASSITER:
Dropped my name?

JULIET:
No, Koffee Klub. (holds up card) Buy 15 coffees, you get one free. You should get one. (hands card to LASSITER)

LASSITER:
(looks at card dubiously) Gee, I don't know. I mean, what am I gonna do with all that extra cash? Let me give you a little lesson, O'Hara...

DISPATCHER:
We have 1144. Deceased male, 1385 Granada Place.

LASSITER:
(into radio) Detectives Lassiter and O'Hara en route. (throws coffee cup out window)

JULIET:
You know that's littering.

LASSITER speeds away.

INT. MONARCH LODGE, MAIN ROOM, DAY

HENRY:
Back up, what do you mean "murdered"?

SHAWN:
Maybe poisoned. I'm not sure yet.

HENRY:
Shawn, this is not the place for one of your reckless assumptions.

SHAWN:
Dad, take a look around. These guys hardly seem broken up by this.

They look around at the members, some of whom are talking business with GUS.

HENRY:
I've known Arthur Holmstrom since the day he joined this Lodge. He was not the most likable guy.

SHAWN:
Fine. Whatever. I have more important issues to deal with. I want the truth. What really happened to my cat, Chairman Meow?

HENRY:
You want answers?

SHAWN:
I want the truth.

HENRY:
You can't handle the truth!

SHAWN and HENRY look at each other because of the line and delivery.

HENRY:
You drive me a little crazy, Shawn. The idea of spending an entire weekend with you...

SHAWN:
I drive you crazy?

HENRY:
Yeah. And your cat got a little too familiar with the armrest of my sofa. There.

TED comes over.

TED:
Henry, I am really sorry for pulling you in on such short notice. It's just we were all really nervous about this. I mean, what if we did something wrong? He had that hood on for 20 minutes. What if he suffocated?

HENRY:
Ted, calm down. It's a cloth hood. You've performed this ceremony, what, a dozen times?

TED:
I know, I know. It's just that we want to make sure it's handled right.

HENRY:
You talked to the police, right?

TED:
Yes, yes. Thank you, thank you. (gives HENRY his phone) Say, is this your son? You know how we love a legacy around here.

HENRY:
No, no, no. No, yes, he is my son, technically, but I...

SHAWN:
(raises a hand to his head) Ted, I'm getting...

HENRY grabs SHAWN by the arm and pulls him away from TED.

HENRY:
No, no, you don't. Not here, Shawn. This is not the time for your shenanigans.

SHAWN:
It was a single shenanigan. Technically more of a hijink, pet killer!

HENRY:
I'm not a pet killer, Shawn. Chairman Meow is living very happily in a retirement home in Ojai. And I don't want to burst your bubble, but Chairman Meow is Chairwoman Meow. (walks away)

The coroner's team arrives and begins to take photos of the body. LASSITER and JULIET arrive with uniforms to help question the members. LASSITER looks around the room in awe, a smile of appreciation on his face. He sees SHAWN.

LASSITER:
Spencer. (does double-take and walks over) No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What the hell are you doing here?

SHAWN:
Lassie, as it happens, my father is a member here. (motions to HENRY talking with a uniform)

LASSITER:
That's impossible. Benevolent Lodge Rule AB-4567 bars any law enforcement member from being a member.

SHAWN shrugs and shakes his head. An older member of the Lodge walks over.

MAN:
Yeah, and that rule is bogus. We made that up to keep out undesirables.

JULIET:
"Undesirables"?

MAN:
People who aren't Lodge material. (looks at LASSITER) Or anyone who's been married to my daughter.

SHAWN makes an "oh" face.

JULIET:
And you are?

LASSITER:
This is Irving Parker. He's my father-in-law.

SHAWN:
Excuse me. (leaves)

PARKER:
Soon-to-be-former-father-in-law.

LASSITER:
Not so fast. Victoria and I have had several civil conversations lately.

PARKER:
Give it up, Carlton! It was a lost cause two years ago, and it's a lost cause now. Get over it. She has. Move on! I think we'll all be better off for it.

PARKER smiles at JULIET and she forces one in return.

JULIET:
Can I talk to you for a second? (pulls LASSITER aside) Are you sure you want to be on this case? You have a personal involvement here.

LASSITER:
That's right, O'Hara, this is personal. And if it does turn out to be something, that's exactly why I need to be on it.

JULIET:
But these people have something against you.

LASSITER:
They won't anymore after I solve it.

JULIET:
Carlton.

LASSITER:
Look. You don't understand, O'Hara. I need to be the hero. I need to solve this case quickly and look brilliant in the process. And you need to help me do that. Please.

GUS:
It's been a pleasure talking with you, Dr. Downs.

DOWNS:
Well, you make quite an impression, Mr. Guster. And under the circumstances, that's saying something.

GUS:
Well, thank you very much. And once again, I want to express my sincere condolences.

DOWNS:
Perhaps you could give my office a call, and we could set aside some time.

GUS:
How about Monday?

DOWNS:
Terrific.

GUS and DOWNS shake hands.

GUS:
Great.

SHAWN walks towards GUS and DOWNS and smiles when he sees GUS closing the deal. He then notices the portraits of the high-ranking members and sees Holmstrom was not the next in line for promotion, IRVING was. HENRY joins him.

HENRY:
We're done here. Gus?

GUS:
Thanks. (waves goodbye to the doctors)

INT. MONARCH LODGE, HALL, DAY

SHAWN:
And another thing, Dad. Just when, exactly, were you a member here?

HENRY:
It was a long time ago, Shawn. I'm not a part of this place anymore. And whether or not this was murder, you are hereby ordered to steer clear.

GUS looks behind HENRY and jabs SHAWN. SHAWN looks and nods. HENRY continues, not realizing he has stopped in front of his own portrait.

HENRY:
These guys are not to be messed with. I cannot possibly be more serious about this.

HENRY sees his portrait and rubs his now-bald head in frustration. SHAWN fails to hide a smile as his father walks away.

INT. PSYCH, NIGHT

GUS is sitting at his desk talking with DOWNS on the phone. SHAWN is sitting at his desk using his laptop.

GUS:
(chuckles) Tuesday at 11:00 is perfect. I'll be there with bells on. Okay. (ends call)

SHAWN:
Dude, who says that?

GUS:
Closers. Closers say that.

SHAWN:
Well, if by closers you mean middle-aged women, then, yes, I do believe I've heard the phrase. Are you forgetting that we many have stumbled up on a murder today? A murder that you're taking entirely too unseriously? The man's name was Arthur Holmstrom, and he died during the Sacred Star Ceremony. Get over here, look at this.

GUS comes over and looks at the video on the screen.

SHAWN:
It's weird.

GUS:
Weird? Those guys look downright evil. White men in hoods?

SHAWN:
Dude, they're violet.

GUS:
That's how it starts, Shawn.

SHAWN looks up and sees a shadow move across the window blinds.

SHAWN:
Do you see that?

GUS sees the shadow.

GUS:
Holy crap, Shawn. Your dad was right. It's one of those scary Lodge guys.

The shadow moves to the next window. SHAWN and GUS move away from the desk and hide behind the sofa.

GUS:
They're here for us. They know you think they killed that guy.

They move to the front office and SHAWN grabs a lamp as GUS picks up a statuette. SHAWN opens the door to reveal LASSITER.

SHAWN:
Lassie. What are you doing here?

LASSITER:
(enters the office) I think you know why I'm here.

GUS closes the door behind LASSITER.

SHAWN:
Hopefully you're here to help. Gus and I were about to do some scrapbooking. We'll need someone who can work the scalloped scissors.

They walk into the main office and LASSITER follows.

LASSITER:
Spencer, I get why you have to act like an ass at my station, but do you have to act like this in your own office?

SHAWN:
It enhances my perception. How else would I know that you came here because you think Arthur Holmstrom was murdered?

LASSITER:
Yeah. No one's talking down at the Lodge. I was just driving by the office and saw the lights on.

SHAWN:
You want to hire us.

LASSITER sighs and tries to come up with an excuse.

SHAWN:
Oh, come on, Lassie, it's not that tough. Let it go.

GUS:
Yes, come on.

SHAWN:
Look around. You're in a safe place. Surrounded by men who love you.

GUS:
Mmm-hmm.

SHAWN:
Gus?

GUS:
Lassiter, I love you.

SHAWN and GUS each pat LASSITER on the arm before they head back to their desks.

LASSITER:
Look. You have a connection in there. So I need you to feel around and see what you can find out.

GUS:
The department's hiring us?

LASSITER:
Not the department, me. And I can't pay you.

GUS:
Well, that sounds worthwhile.

LASSITER:
I guess this would technically be called a... favor. Maybe I could pay your expenses.

SHAWN:
(slaps desk) Done! 15 grand a day, and when we're finished, we all go for a picnic.

LASSITER:
This is a discreet investigation.

SHAWN:
I'd like to show you something. (holds out hand, palm down) See this? It's the Lodge radar. And look at this. (moves his other hand below) It's me flying underneath it. (squawks) Now look down here. It's Gus. He can't fly. (uses first hand on desk)

LASSITER:
It is imperative that you keep a low profile.

INT. MONARCH LODGE, MAIN ROOM, DAY

The members are gathered around a man in the center of the room.

MAN:
Place the robe on our new brother.

The new brother turns around and it's SHAWN. One of the brothers fastens the clasp and the others applaud. SHAWN shakes hands with a few as others pat him on the back.

SHAWN:
That's it, huh?

MAN:
Yes.

SHAWN:
I'm official? No brimstone? I don't have to crab walk or get tickled with a feather? Come on. Somebody, tickle me with a feather. You.

MAN:
Gentlemen, to the bar.

MAN 2:
Yes.

SHAWN:
Save me a shot.

The members leave the room. GUS peers in through another door and SHAWN nods for him to come in.

GUS:
Don't you think it's odd that it's just business as usual when someone died here the other day?

SHAWN:
Definitely. It appears as though he's been all but forgotten. Look. Holmstrom's already been moved. Those paintings are in order of rank. Once the Highmost Patriarch moves on, he's replaced by the next guy in line.

GUS:
That's Irving Parker.

SHAWN:
Right. Holmstrom was fifth in line. Somehow he leap-frogged three other guys, including Parker and two of your doctor buddies.

They look around the room and notice plaques on the shelves.

SHAWN:
25 Gs for "Komputers for Kids"? 30 Gs for "Toys for Kids." 15 grand for "Clothing for Kids"?

GUS:
These guys are ultra-philanthropists. They're the most charitable organization in the city. Why would they commit murder?

SHAWN:
Well, maybe it was for the kids.

They move over to a display case holding an ornate hood.

SHAWN:
Oh! "The shroud of Charlemagne". Dude, Holmstrom was wearing this hood the day he died. Check it out, it's 100 years old. Like a lot of the guys around this place. (holds up fist for a bump but an old man is standing there) Sorry.

MAN:
What?

SHAWN:
Nothing.

SHAWN looks around for GUS and sees him with the other members chatting in the bar. He joins them.

INT. MONARCH LODGE, BAR, DAY

GUS:
Oh, Shawn. You know my newest clients, Dr. Masood Nigam, and Dr. Roger Downs.

SHAWN:
Yes, yes, I do. Congratulations on your clientship. (gives shortened version of handshake) Oh, just... You're in good hands with Gus. Nimble, agile hands. Surgeon's hands, really. He once removed a boil from his own thigh using a paper clip and a warm can of Sprite.

The doctors stare at them and GUS can't believe SHAWN said that.

EXT. LODGE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk out the front door.

SHAWN:
Dude, when did you have time to make all these sales? We were in there for an hour.

GUS:
An hour is all you need, Shawn, when you've got sales reptitude.

GUS looks around and sees another member leaving the Lodge. He taps SHAWN on the arm and walks over to the man.

GUS:
Dr. McOrmley, can I talk to you for a second?

McORMLEY:
What can I do for you?

SHAWN'S cell phone rings. He looks at the ID before answering.

SHAWN:
You're calling me a day after our first date? You really are out of practice.

INT. LASSITER'S CAR, DAY

LASSITER is sitting at the wheel, phone to his ear.

LASSITER:
So what'd you find out?

SHAWN:
Well, it appears our victim made top dog with very little effort. One day he was fifth in line for the job, the next day he was Highmost Patriarch. Oh, and the next day he was dead.

LASSITER:
Does anyone suspect you?

SHAWN:
(chuckles) No. Members are beyond suspicion.

LASSITER:
Member? Oh, Sweet Justice! They made you a member?

SHAWN:
Now, don't get all mad, Lassie. There was a 15-minute waiting period. I finally learned the lyrics to Informer while they convened and agreed on me.

A motorcycle drives by SHAWN and only moments later he hears it over the phone. SHAWN follows the sound.

GUS:
Let me give you my card, Dr. McOrmley, 'cause you do not want to miss out on this baby. (hands the doctor his card)

SHAWN stops at a berm overlooking the road.

SHAWN:
Are you staking me out?

LASSITER:
No. (looks through binoculars)

SHAWN:
Yes, you are.

LASSITER:
No, I'm not.

SHAWN runs down to the road and behind LASSITER'S car.

SHAWN:
I can sense you're right around the corner.

LASSITER puts down the binoculars, ends the call and reaches for the keys in the ignition.

SHAWN:
(leans through passenger window) Whoa, you're breaking up. Can you call me back, Lassie? (closes phone)

LASSITER'S phone rings as SHAWN gets into the car.

LASSITER:
I don't have time for this. I've got another call. (answers phone) O'Hara, finally.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is at her desk.

JULIET:
Where are you?

LASSITER:
I'm at lunch.

JULIET:
Ooh! Get me a turkey and avocado. (sits)

SHAWN:
Let me talk to her.

LASSITER:
Hands off! (slaps SHAWN'S hands away)

JULIET:
Is someone there with you?

SHAWN:
Hi, Jules.

LASSITER:
Spencer.

JULIET:
You're having lunch with Shawn?

LASSITER:
Maybe.

JULIET:
Is something going on?

LASSITER:
Look, do you have the toxicology reports on Holmstrom or not?

JULIET:
Yeah, but they're inconclusive. Well, actually, they're just strange.

LASSITER:
Strange how?

SHAWN:
Oh, come on!

SHAWN grabs LASSITER hand and put the phone on speaker. LASSITER sets it on the dashboard.

JULIET:
Well, it doesn't look like natural causes, and his blood had trace elements of... I don't even want to say.

LASSITER:
Come on, O'Hara.

JULIET:
Well, it had what looks like the toxin similar to the venom of a Brazilian vine snake.

LASSITER:
You've gotta be kidding me.

SHAWN:
He got bit by a snake?

LASSITER:
Shhh!

JULIET:
Am I on speaker phone?

SHAWN:
No.

JULIET:
Well, then, how did he hear...

SHAWN:
Jules, how about you just tell us, hunh?

JULIET:
He didn't have a mark on him. There weren't any puncture wounds. The only thing he had was a little skin irritation on his face.

LASSITER:
Obviously these results are inconclusive, so run the tests again because we need results that aren't ridiculous.

SHAWN:
I don't know, Lassie, I kind a like this snake idea.

JULIET:
Why are you sharing information with Shawn on a case we haven't hired him for?

LASSITER:
(picks up phone and taps it) You know what, O'Hara? You're breaking up. I'll call you back. (imitates static before ending call)

SHAWN:
Nice.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are at their desks eating Chinese when HENRY storms in.

HENRY:
You joined the Lodge?

SHAWN:
What can I do, Dad? I'm a legacy. It's in our blood.

HENRY:
Damn it, Shawn, I'm not kidding. You've got to reconsider this. You get a lot of powerful people into one room, and dangerous things happen. Would you please let the police just do their job?

SHAWN:
I am working for the police.

GUS:
Sort of.

SHAWN:
It's a discreet investigation.

HENRY:
Yeah. Discreet. That's one of your talents.

SHAWN:
I'm working on a theory. Arthur Holmstrom was poisoned with snake venom.

HENRY:
Snake venom?

GUS:
The Brazilian Vine Snake. Specific to remote river basins in Northern Brazil. About two to three feet in length.

HENRY:
So someone snuck a three-foot snake in to the Lodge and killed him during the ceremony? The perfect crime.

SHAWN:
Right. Except there were no marks left on the body.

HENRY:
Oh! So we're looking for an invisible snake. You know, Shawn, that's it. Right--right there. That is your problem. Maybe you'd be better off looking for something that you can see. (looks at a chart of the Lodge hierarchy) There is a pecking order, right in front of your eyes. (uses soda to make a straw crawl to the Highmost Patriarch)

SHAWN:
Oh, Dad! You're gonna ruin my diagram!

HENRY:
Yep, who's at the top? Who's the next guy in line?

SHAWN:
I know where the top is, you could have just pointed. Now there's Coke all over everything.

HENRY:
Forget it. Just grow up. (walks out)

SHAWN:
Me grow up? A grown man makes a crawly snake.

EXT. PARKER EXPORTS, DAY

SHAWN and GUS sit in the Echo across the street from the business.

SHAWN:
This is Parker's place.

GUS:
I can see the sign, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Well, I bet they're very busy inside. Might I suggest coming back this evening and breaking in?

GUS:
Good idea. Let me see what I'm doing for the next three to five years, with time off for good behavior. We're here now. I can get us in. (unfastens seatbelt and gets out of the car)

SHAWN:
Whoa! (gets out of the car) All of a sudden you can just "get us in"?

GUS:
Shawn, I'm totally in a sales zone this week. You leave this secret handshake to me. (rubs his thumb against the side of his nose)

INT. PARKER EXPORTS, RECEPTION, DAY

The RECEPTIONIST checks the appointments. SHAWN is looking at the items on her desk.

RECEPTIONIST:
I'm not showing an appointment, Mr...

GUS:
Guster. Burton Guster. And this is my associate William Zane. I'm an old friend, and I'm just paying Mr. Parker a birthday visit.

RECEPTIONIST:
It's not his birthday.

GUS:
I know, it's mine. We're here on Lodge business.

SHAWN:
That's a three right there.

As the RECEPTIONIST looks down to fill in the Soduku puzzle, GUS jabs SHAWN in the arm.

SHAWN:
What?

RECEPTIONIST:
Nothing better to do on your birthday?

GUS:
Well, it's my 29th, not one of the important ones. You'll understand when you get to be my age.

RECEPTIONIST:
Mmmm! (giggles)

GUS:
I'll only be a minute. (heads for the door)

RECEPTIONIST:
I'll just let him know that you're here. (reaches for phone)

GUS:
No, no need, Doris. (walks back to desk) It's my birthday. Surprise! (taps SHAWN on the back as he heads for the door)

SHAWN:
You still need a seven right there.

GUS:
Billy?

SHAWN goes with GUS.

INT. PARKER EXPORTS, WAREHOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the large warehouse.

SHAWN:
It's your birthday? That's your sales reptitude?

GUS:
It comes in all flavors, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Is "suck" a flavor? (gasps when he sees a lidded urn) Dude! The world's very first crock-pot.

PARKER rides up on a forklift and SHAWN smiles and waves.

PARKER:
What the hell are you guys doing here?

SHAWN:
Mr. Parker! It's me, Shawn Spencer. I'm the newest Monarch, remember?

PARKER stops the forklift and gets off the vehicle.

PARKER:
Yeah, I remember. So what the hell are you guys doing wandering around my warehouse?

SHAWN:
This is my very good friend Gus. He's looking to join the Monarch Lodge too. I thought maybe you could make that happen. You know, haze him a little bit. Soak his hand in warm water while he's sleeping, that sort of thing. Do you have any sheep here? (looks around)

PARKER:
This is not the Lodge. This is my place of business. And the fact that you slid into membership on the coat tails of your turncoat dad, that doesn't guarantee any favors from me. Now I'm through talking to you nicely. I want you to turn around and get the hell out of here. Right now!

As PARKER talks, SHAWN looks around and notices the airport codes on the box shipping labels. SHAWN and GUS turn around and head for the exit.

SHAWN:
I'm surprised he didn't say "Good day".

PARKER:
What's that?

SHAWN:
I said good day!

GUS grabs SHAWN by the arm and pulls him from the room as PARKER watches them leave.

EXT. PARKER EXPORTS, ENTRANCE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk out of the building.

SHAWN:
Dude, did you see those shipping crates? CCI, AIF, XAP. Those are airport codes, all Brazilian.

GUS:
Brazilian airport codes? How do you know that?

SHAWN:
I lived in an airport for a month, Gus.

GUS:
That was Tom Hanks in The Terminal.

SHAWN:
Same difference. We need to talk to Lassiter.

GUS:
No, you need to talk to Lassiter. I'll drop you off.

SHAWN:
Where are you going?

GUS:
I have appointments with four new clients. And product doesn't sell itself.

SHAWN:
Man!

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN walks into the station and sees LASSITER in the hall.

SHAWN:
Lassie?

LASSITER:
Anything?

SHAWN:
(walks over to LASSITER) Well, I've got good news, and I've got bad news. The good news is we found a pretty solid suspect on the Holmstrom murder.

LASSITER:
Finally. Well, who is it? Let's go get him.

SHAWN:
That's the bad news.

JULIET brings PARKER into the station.

PARKER:
That is ridiculous! Who's in charge here, huh? I'll tell you this, I better be home for dinner! Heads are gonna roll, that's all I got to say! Heads are gonna roll!

LASSITER watches, mouth agape.

LASSITER:
Oh, no. (puts hand on column) Do not go down that road.

SHAWN:
Look, I'm not happy about this either, Lassie. Now that I've joined the Lodge, that makes your father-in-law my brother. Which makes me your uncle, in-law. It's gonna get especially awkward around the holidays.

LASSITER:
Spencer, you can't seriously suspect Parker.

SHAWN:
Unfortunately, it sort of checks out. If it was venom that killed Holmstrom, it came from a snake that only slithers in a region where Parker does half his business.

LASSITER leans back against the column as JULIET joins them.

JULIET:
He's in Room A. Who's going to question him?

LASSITER:
I will.

JULIET:
Carlton, do you really think this is a good idea? You're related. It's against department policy. You could wind up...

LASSITER:
O'Hara, quiet. I'm gonna handle it. Don't you dare tell the Chief. I can't believe this is happening.

The phone on LASSITER'S desk rings and JULIET answers it.

JULIET:
Lassiter's desk. (holds receiver to her shoulder) It's your wife. I mean your ex-wife.

LASSITER:
(takes phone) Hey! Yeah, well, it seems that Irving is kind of a... Well, he's a murder suspect. Yes. No, this is not because I want the barbecue. I already gave you the golf clubs.

SHAWN and JULIET walk away giving LASSITER some privacy.

SHAWN:
So how'd he go?

JULIET:
Not quietly.

SHAWN:
(nods to LASSITER) You ever meet his wife?

JULIET:
No, and if she's anything like her dad, I don't want to.

LASSITER:
Okay. (hangs up phone and walks over)

SHAWN:
(whispers) Seems scared.

LASSITER:
O'Hara, please go down to the room. I'll be down in a minute.

JULIET leaves.

LASSITER:
(walks with SHAWN down the hall, hand on his shoulder) Spencer, I want you to listen to me, and listen closely. I know Irving Parker very well, and he wouldn't kill anyone. Sure, he might hobble their spirit and crush their soul and dance in the flaming ashes of their broken marriage, which he had a part in ending, but he wouldn't kill anyone.

They stop at the top of the stairs.

SHAWN:
Look, he's the only suspect we have. He tried to hate me to death. I know it's circumstantial, but in a pretty bad way.

LASSITER:
I know, and I'm going to go treat him just as I would any other suspect. But I think Holmstrom's murderer is still out there. Just... just workshop it. Do whatever it is you do, because at the end of the day, it absolutely cannot be him. (continues on)

SHAWN:
"Workshop it"?

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER walks in and watches through the mirror as PARKER talks with JULIET. PARKER suddenly stops and looks straight at LASSITER even though he can't see him. LASSITER swallows. He then gathers himself and heads for the door.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN is at his clear board looking at the "did its" and "not did its" for PARKER being the suspect. He counts the "did its".

SHAWN:
...four, five, six, seven, eight...

He moves over to the "not did its" which is a blank column. He caps his pen.

SHAWN:
I don't know if reverse engineering the case was such a good idea. "Did its" won 12-zip.

GUS:
But Lassiter said he was sure that Parker's not our guy.

SHAWN:
Well, the board seems to disagree vehemently.

GUS:
Fine, then let's move away from him, and check out the other Lodge members. What do we know about Holmstrom?

SHAWN:
Holmstrom! We know he's dead. That's a good start.

GUS:
I'm serious, Shawn. I was in that lodge making contacts.

SHAWN:
I know. You have sales reptitude. Now can we please retire that expression? Throw it a party, put it on Medicare, it's just not working anymore.

GUS:
No, Shawn, what I'm saying is those other Lodge members were hardly overwhelmed with grief. Even as Holmstrom lay on the floor, I was shamelessly moving my product, and no one seemed to think anything of it. I'd say Holmstrom had some enemies.

SHAWN:
Well, we gotta figure out who they are.

GUS:
And how do we do that?

SHAWN:
(checks watch) Ooh! There's something much more important we have to do first.

SHAWN heads for the door and GUS follows.

INT. MONARCH LODGE, ART STUDIO, DAY

SHAWN is sitting on a stool in a suit jacket, dress shirt and tie as he has his portrait painted.

SHAWN:
Tobias, I've heard the canvas adds ten pounds. Is that accurate? Maybe you could paint some angry tigers or a puma laying prostrate at my feet.

TOBIAS:
This is a portrait of your head.

GUS:
I thought we were here to find something about Holmstrom.

SHAWN:
We are. This is for posterity. Don't worry, you're next.

TOBIAS:
He doesn't get one. He's not a member yet.

SHAWN:
Maybe we could paint him in the background of mine. Put his head in the puma's mouth.

GUS:
You're going to ignore that.

SHAWN:
Hey, why did they take Arthur Holmstrom's painting down so quickly?

TOBIAS:
All of his things were taken over to his house.

EXT. HOLMSTROM'S HOUSE, NIGHT

GUS and SHAWN peer out from behind bushes before running across the lawn to the front door. They leap over the small row of bushes lining the walk causing lights to come on. They leap back onto the lawn and the lights go off.

SHAWN:
(puts finger to lips) Shh, shh. Do it lightly.

They jump over the hedges and the lights come on again. They jump back onto the lawn. SHAWN then points to the side of the walk that will keep them away from the lights.

INT. HOLMSTROM'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS work on opening the front door.

SHAWN:
(muffled whisper) Come on!

GUS:
(muffled whisper) Oh, now you're gonna act like you're gonna open up the door?

SHAWN opens the door and enters.

SHAWN:
Say what you will about credit cards and paper clips, sometimes a door just needs to be owned. (holds up a screwdriver)

GUS:
That's a screwdriver, Shawn. (shuts the door)

SHAWN:
Screwdrivers, too.

GUS:
I think it was unlocked.

SHAWN:
It was not unlocked. (starts up the stairs)

GUS:
I think it was.

SHAWN:
The door was most definitely not unlocked.

GUS shushes him.

SHAWN:
Gus, the man was a widower. Nobody's here.

GUS:
Why don't you let me use my new contacts to get the information?

INT. HOLMSTROM'S HOUSE, OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS enter the room and GUS switches on the lights.

SHAWN:
Is that how we do things, Gus, really? Why talk to someone about Holmstrom when we could have his home office tell us everything we need to know? (walks around the room) His hopes, his dreams. (turns around a framed photo of a woman on the desk) His love for the ladies.

GUS looks at other photos on the mantel.

GUS:
I think that's his wife.

SHAWN:
Fact, people lie. (swings about statue) Stuff doesn't. (puts statue down)

They hear a rattling and look to the door.

GUS:
Did you lock the front door?

SHAWN:
Yes, I locked the door!

GUS:
I don't think it was locked.

SHAWN:
I know I locked the door!

Glass shatters.

SHAWN:
You see that? They had to break a window. Burn!

They scurry for hiding places. GUS curls up on a chair as SHAWN stands in the corner by the fireplace and holds a bellows in front of his face.

GUS:
No!

SHAWN puts down the bellows and steps into the fireplace, spreading his arms out across the mantel. GUS goes to the same corner by the file cabinets and uses the bellows.

SHAWN:
I just tried that.

GUS:
Well, I did it in a different spot, Shawn!

They hear footsteps in the hallway. GUS switches off the lights.

SHAWN:
He's coming, he's coming, coming, coming! (drops to the floor spread-eagle)

GUS:
Shh, shh! (runs into SHAWN'S leg)

SHAWN:
Ow!

GUS:
Shh! Watch out!

GUS kicks SHAWN and he gets up.

INT. HOLMSTROM'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL, NIGHT

The intruder comes up the stairs.

INT. HOLMSTROM'S HOUSE, OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN looks around nervously before diving under the desk. The door opens and the figure comes in with a flashlight. As he walks past the desk, we see SHAWN and GUS tangled up underneath. SHAWN watches as the intruder looks through the files, throwing them to the floor as well as rifling through books on the shelves.

SHAWN:
(whispers) People breaking into offices. No one respects anything anymore.

GUS shushes SHAWN and he shushes back, actually reaching out a finger to press against GUS' lips. GUS slaps his hand away. SHAWN notices a speck on one of the man's shoes. Frustrated in his search, the man throws a file onto the floor close to the desk. GUS moves his foot, pinching SHAWN's hand and he grimaces. He reacts by moving his leg. GUS moves again, kicking SHAWN in the shoulder.

SHAWN:
Ow!

The intruder leaves the office.

SHAWN:
My God, did you see who that was?

GUS:
It's hard to see anything with someone's knee in your eye.

SHAWN:
It's your own knee.

GUS:
Get out of here!

They crawl out and stand up with a few grunts. GUS turns on the lights as SHAWN looks around.

SHAWN:
Whoa! Look at this place. Whoever was here wasn't invited either.

Behind SHAWN, GUS sees a safe hidden behind the bookshelf.

GUS:
A secret safe.

SHAWN:
(looks at safe before looking back at GUS) Dude, you gotta get us in there.

GUS:
I can't get us in that safe, Shawn. That's a Martin 16.

SHAWN:
You're 36 months into a subscription to Modern Safecracker Magazine. What's the point?

GUS:
I'm an amateur, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Well, it's time to go pro, Fingers.

GUS:
Fingers?

SHAWN:
Twist it up.

GUS:
Watch out.

GUS pushes SHAWN out of the way and walks to the safe. He trips on debris on the floor. He stands in front of the safe and blows softly at it. He flaps his jacket back a couple of times as he prepares.

SHAWN:
Would you stop it!

GUS:
Shh! Now I've gotta start all over.

GUS then strikes a pose. His left arm is forward and his right hand is held back at eye-level. He then jabs his hand forward to the combination dial.

SHAWN:
This month would be good.

GUS:
Shh!

SHAWN looks around and sees a photo of Holmstrom's wife from the fifties. She is wearing a tight-fitting glamorous dress that shows off her figure.

GUS:
(gives up) It's not happening, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Try 36-24-36.

GUS:
Are you serious?

SHAWN:
Just click it in gentle.

SHAWN watches as GUS tries the combination. It doesn't work.

GUS:
That was a good idea. Now what?

SHAWN:
Huh, I really thought I nailed that.

GUS catches SHAWN looking at the photo and laughs.

GUS:
Shawn, you've really gotta work on your estimating skills. (works the combination) 36-24-38.

The safe opens.

SHAWN:
Dude! You're a safecracking machine!

GUS:
I know.

SHAWN:
Grab that.

GUS takes the ledgers from the safe and they open them side-by-side on the desk.

SHAWN:
All right, I've got $25,000 for Komputers for Kids. This one says 35,000. One of these books is a fraud. Dude, Holmstrom was skimming funds from the Lodge. And look, he's writing in some secret, ancient code.

GUS:
No, this isn't code, they're abbreviations. HX means "history", QD means "every day", C means "and". Deposit history, follow up with accounts every day, transfer and withdrawals.

SHAWN:
You're telling me you can read this?

GUS:
Of course I can. This is doctor's shorthand. And this is doctor's handwriting. See these sticky notes? Holmstrom wrote these. He wasn't skimming, he figured out who was.

SHAWN:
One of the doctors is cooking the books. How sure are you?

GUS:
85, 86%.

SHAWN:
We've gone on much less.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM A, NIGHT

LASSITER has his jacket off and sits at the head of the table. PARKER sits at the side, arms crossed.

LASSITER:
Look, Irving, it's been four hours.

PARKER:
Is that all? You know, Carlton, it may be the rage talking, but if I had it to do over again, the day my Tory came home with you, I would have told her to go right back out that door and come back alone. That's what I should have done.

As PARKER talks, LASSITER rubs his head like he's getting a migraine. Finally, he's had enough and stands up in a rush and leans over the table at PARKER.

LASSITER:
All right, Irving, that's enough! Now, I loved Victoria, and because she loved you, I let it slide that you're a pain in the ass. But you're at my table now, and around here, we call someone like you a hostile witness. It's a good way to get yourself locked up. I can make your life a living hell, so you better give me the respect I deserve. And I suggest you cut the crap, clear? I want a straight answer, and I want it immediately. (sits) How did Arthur Holmstrom advance to the Highmost Patriarch when you were the next in line?

PARKER:
Well, I don't know how Art convinced the other guys. He asked me, and I said it was okay. He was a friend of mine, and he had health problems. He was getting worse. And I gave him the only chance he'd probably ever get. Now, as for the snake business, I haven't traveled abroad in over three years. I haven't been out of the country since you got married. Doctor's orders. Are we done? (makes to stand)

LASSITER:
We're done when I say we're done! (pause) We're done. You can go.

PARKER gets up and walks to the door.

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN stands next to the Echo as GUS takes his case from the back.

SHAWN:
We've been to four doctors' offices. None of the handwriting matches the books. Plus, I probably caught something from somebody, and I'm tired of reading Highlights for Children. They always hide the apple in the bike.

They start walking towards the office.

GUS:
Can you man up, Shawn? Is that possible? I'm on an unbelievable hot streak right now, and I'm not about to ruin it.

SHAWN:
It's good to know that moving oozing infection gel is more important than finding a killer. Hey, maybe we could park on a steeper incline next time. My quads aren't burning enough.

INT. MEDICAL CENTER, RECEPTION, DAY

SHAWN looks around seeing a number of photos on the wall from Third World countries. As the RECEPTIONIST comes out, SHAWN ducks down.

RECEPTIONIST:
Tell Heather to call back tomorrow.

SHAWN smacks GUS on the leg.

RECEPTIONIST:
(sees GUS) Yes?

SHAWN smacks GUS again, moving him towards the entrance to the offices. GUS walks around the desk, giving SHAWN a clear path as he distracts the RECEPTIONIST.

GUS:
Good afternoon. I'm Burton Guster, with Central Coast Pharmaceuticals.

RECEPTIONIST:
We're closed.

INT. MEDICAL CENTER, HALL, DAY

SHAWN sneaks down the hall and into DOWNS' examination room.

INT. MEDICAL CENTER, RECEPTION, DAY

GUS:
Yes, well, I'm here to drop off some product to Dr. Downs. He's a brother of mine.

The RECEPTIONIST stares at him.

INT. MEDICAL CENTER, EXAM ROOM, DAY

SHAWN looks through a medicine cabinet and finds gloves with a very unique pattern. He remembers seeing the same pattern imprinted on DOWNS' arm when he shook hands with GUS. He closes the cabinet door and heads for the hall, stubbing his toe as he peers out into the hall.

SHAWN:
Ow!

INT. MEDICAL CENTER, HALL, DAY

SHAWN staggers into the hall in agony. Realizing someone might come looking, he ducks into another room.

INT. MEDICAL CENTER, RECEPTION, DAY

RECEPTIONIST:
He isn't here at...(looks down the hall)

GUS:
Well, he was expecting me.

RECEPTIONIST:
You can leave your card.(holds out her hand)

INT. MEDICAL CENTER, HALL, DAY

SHAWN steps onto a scale and is going to weigh himself before changing his mind. He steps off and sees a framed article on the wall for a powdered vaccine. He peers back down the hall to see if it's clear.

INT. MEDICAL CENTER, RECEPTION, DAY

GUS:
I just thought I'd drop by and pay him a birthday visit. It's my birthday, the big two-nine. Remember that one?

RECEPTIONIST:
(glares) I'm 26. (sits)

GUS:
Really?

GUS looks down the hall and sees SHAWN stick his head out, holding an African mask in front of his face. He points at GUS and ducks into another room.

GUS:
Uh, so, will Dr. Downs be here later?

RECEPTIONIST:
(stands and snatches card from his hand) I will make sure he gets this. (walks away)

INT. MEDICAL CENTER, OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN searches DOWNS' office and sees that the writing on the desk calendar matches that from the ledgers. He heads for the door but hides behind frosted glass as the RECEPTIONIST strides down the hall. He runs out as soon as she passes.

EXT. STREET, DAY

GUS is waiting by the car as SHAWN runs out.

SHAWN:
Dude! I just solved it. Call Lassie.

They get in the car.

INT. LASSITER'S CAR, DAY

JULIET answers her phone.

JULIET:
O'Hara. Right. (turns to LASSITER) 13850 Granada.

She barely closes her phone before LASSITER is speeding down the street, siren wailing.

INT. MONARCH LODGE, MAIN ROOM, DAY

The members are gathered in a circle, PARKER on the throne in the robes of the Highmost Patriarch.

DOWNS:
(makes toast) To absent friends.

MEMBERS:
To absent friends.

SHAWN and GUS enter the room.

SHAWN:
Absent friends? Like Arthur Holmstrom?

DOWNS:
What?

SHAWN:
(walks to the center of the circle) My sweet violet brothers, we congregate here today in the flesh, not only to recognize our new Highmost Patriarch, Irv Parker, but also to bear witness, along with the magic head of Gus, the wisdom of Baum (looks up at owl hanging from the ceiling) and that... (looks at ferret on the mantle) That stuffed creature. Arthur Holmstrom was murdered. (turns slowly in a circle and points) Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck... goose! (pulls down DOWNS' hood) Dr. Roger Downs, entrusted with the proceeds of charity activities, was funneling funds into his own pocket and covering his tracks by using a dummy accounting ledger. Now, when Holmstrom discovered the corruption, he confronted downs and made a play for the Highmost Patriarch position. In exchange for his silence, Holmstrom got what he wanted. But Downs still couldn't chance getting caught. And so he killed his own Lodge brother right here on the eye of Hathor in the middle of the Lodge. And this is the murder weapon.

JULIET and LASSITER arrive and push their way through.

DOWNS:
How dare you accuse me? I am a respected officer of this Lodge.

SHAWN:
(sees speck on DOWNS' shoe) By the shores of Gitchagoomee, I can see you in the house, frantically searching for the ledgers that Holmstrom kept securely stored in his safe, ironically, to keep you good to your word.

DOWNS:
(chuckles nervously) Arthur Holmstrom's death was, unfortunate, but I had nothing to do with it.

SHAWN throws the cloth shroud to LASSITER.

SHAWN:
Check it out, Lassie. I'm quite certain you'll find traces of a powdered form of the venom of the Brazilian vine snake, native to Brazil. It's part of an anti-venom that Dr. Downs uses in his charitable work abroad. Who knew that in small doses it acts as a vaccine, while larger doses are absolutely lethal?

Various members raise their hands and say "I did".

SHAWN:
Really?

DOWNS:
This is absurd! Holmstrom died of natural causes.

SHAWN:
By the halls of Montezuma, I see you taking great care to put on protective gloves while lining the inside of the hood with the powder for Holmstrom's Patriarch ceremony, making it deadly venomous. The poor old man's head and face never stood a chance. Not too keen on the Hippocratic Oath, are we, Rog?

DOWNS:
(walks up to SHAWN) I have nothing to say. Speak to my lawyer.

DOWNS starts to walk away but JULIET stops him.

JULIET:
Hold it right there, Dr. Downs. You're under arrest.

Uniformed officers cuff DOWNS.

SHAWN:
And none of this, your Highmost, would have been discovered without the intrepid police work of one Detective Carlton Lassiter, Santa Barbara Police Department's own Highmost Patriarch.

As SHAWN walks past LASSITER, he slaps him on the rear. He goes over to GUS and they fist-bump before leaving.

PARKER:
Nice collar, Detective.

LASSITER:
It's all in a day's work, Irving.

PARKER:
(steps down from throne) You may not be my son-in-law much longer, but I'm thinking you might be a Monarch yet.

The members applaud and LASSITER looks around in surprise.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN is sitting at his desk when HENRY comes in.

HENRY:
(knocks) Hey! You ready to go?

SHAWN:
What could you possibly mean by that?

HENRY:
Our big weekend, remember? I cancelled, I felt bad. So I just thought we'd go this weekend.

SHAWN:
Ooh, Dad, I wish you'd given me a little bit of advance notice. I'm... I'm swamped here.

HENRY looks at the screen and sees SHAWN is playing Tetris.

HENRY:
Yeah, right. All right, look, I'm gonna go. You want to come along, you're welcome. (walks away)

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad, wait a second. There's still something that doesn't make any sense to me. (stands) Why did you leave the Lodge?

HENRY:
Look, Shawn, it's not important, let it go.

SHAWN:
Come on, you big liar. Throw a little truth on the barbie, see if it stinks.

HENRY:
What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
I'm talking about man candor. Let's have some.

HENRY:
All right, all right, you want some man candor. You want the truth? My marriage was falling apart, and I made a choice. I stopped caring about the Lodge, because I realized the only real membership that mattered was family. There.

SHAWN:
Family? (laughs) You really expect me to believe that?

The sound of hammering comes from the outer office.

HENRY:
What the hell is that?

SHAWN:
This you gotta see.

HENRY follows SHAWN to the outer office where GUS has hung both SHAWN and HENRY'S Lodge portraits.

GUS:
Nice addition, don't you think?

SHAWN:
We grabbed 'em on our way out of the Lodge.

HENRY:
Way out?

SHAWN:
Yeah, Gus and I decided we didn't want to belong to a club that would have Lassiter as a member. You can have yours if you want it.

HENRY:
Nah. No, I think it should stay right where it is. That way I can always keep an eye on you.

Episode 2x15 Black and Tan: A Crime of Fashion

Sorry for the delay! I haven't forgotten.



1987

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

HENRY is sitting at the table reading the paper and having coffee before leaving for work. SHAWN attempts to sneak down the stairs and out the door to school without HENRY realizing.

HENRY:
Shawn, where's that nice new sweater vest your mom just put on you for picture day?

SHAWN:
(stops and slowly turns around, walking back) Yeah, that. It wasn't working for us. We chose the Knight Rider shirt instead. Mom loves K.I.T.T. (walks away)

HENRY:
Do you know how a cop distinguishes when somebody's lying?

SHAWN:
(stops) When it sounds like that.

HENRY:
Go upstairs, put the vest back on. Pictures last forever, Shawn. I want you to look your best.

SHAWN puts down his backpack and goes back upstairs.

PRESENT DAY

EXT. STREET, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are striding down the sidewalk. SHAWN seems to have made extra effort to dress nice, right down to the snakeskin boots.

GUS:
There's a body in a service elevator?

SHAWN:
No bodies.

GUS:
A dogfighting ring?

SHAWN:
No.

GUS:
A missing snowman?

SHAWN:
Yes, a snowman is missing, but we're not on that case. Relax.

GUS:
I am not working.

SHAWN:
I know you aren't.

GUS:
I do not work on my birthday.

SHAWN:
I think you've made your position clear on that.

GUS:
Then tell me where we're going.

SHAWN:
That's not how a surprise works.

They stop in front of a club holding a private party complete with red carpet and velvet rope. There is a sign saying "Ciao! Is Now".

SHAWN:
Happy birthday, dude. (chuckles) Welcome to the fall line launch party for Ciao clothing. (grips GUS' shoulder in a friendly shake) Gorgeous models, fake celebrities. No food, though.

They walk down the carpet.

GUS:
This is the most exclusive event of the year. What's the rub?

A MAN with a clipboard and earpiece looks up as SHAWN and GUS approach.

MAN:
I think you're in the wrong line there, gentlemen.

SHAWN:
I think we're on the V.I.P List.

MAN:
Names?

SHAWN:
Black and Tan.

MAN:
First names?

SHAWN:
No first names. One of us is Black, and one of us is Tan. We're a modeling team. Perhaps you've heard of us.

GUS:
Let's just go.

SHAWN:
We're retired. Just check your list.

The MAN checks the list.

MAN:
Holy crap, it is you. Sorry for the mix-up, Tan. (unclips the rope to let them pass)

SHAWN:
I beg your pardon? My name is Black. His name is Tan. I can't believe you just made that assumption. You should be ashamed of yourself and your family.

They walk past the MAN. GUS rubs his thumb against his nose, his "cool" move.

INT. CLUB, NIGHT

Dance music plays as GUS and SHAWN enter the busy club.

GUS:
Okay, how did you pull that off?

SHAWN:
Well, Ciao's number was in the phone book. I don't ever want to hear again that my Filipino accent doesn't work magic.

GUS:
(looks around at the models) This is one of the most thoughtful presents anyone's ever given me. Oh man, that's Berlinda Desidovicz!

SHAWN:
The waitress?

GUS:
She's not a waitress, she's the model. The one from the Floppy Cakes ad. The third girl on the left on that billboard I always point out.

SHAWN:
You know her name?

GUS:
Her name? I know her life story. She has a fan club. Well, she's putting one together. I'm number one on the interest list. She's one of the most popular models in the entire Santa Barbara downtown area, Shawn. I've been in love with her since the Icy Pops ad.

SHAWN:
She's the one that says, "Gooey".

GUS:
Yes, she's the "Gooey" girl.

SHAWN:
This is huge for you, man! I'll hook it up. (starts to walk away)

GUS:
(grabs SHAWN by the arm) Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can take care of this myself. What you think? Should I pull out the "cheetah"? (holds up hands like claws)

SHAWN:
The "cheetah" is the worst name for a pickup move in the history of mankind. Remember the rule. Treat a woman like a person. Then, a princess. Then, a Greek goddess. Then, a person again. Besides, I think "Operation Colonel Sugar Lemons" is a much better move for a place like this.

GUS:
Cool. (slaps SHAWN on the back and walks away)

SHAWN:
Good luck!

GUS struts over to BERLINDA but another model cuts in front of him. SHAWN smiles at his friend's awkwardness. He walks around, looking at everyone.

CIAOBELLA:
Oh! Emily! God!

The woman throws down a plastic cup filled with a drink. The younger woman at her side, EMILY, looks down at the floor.

WOMAN ON PA:
Ladies and gentlemen, our Chairman and Founder, Gregor Uwe-Steeb.

SHAWN notices slight discoloration on the first two fingers on CIAOBELLA'S right hand. EMILY starts to clean the spilled drink. The crowd cheers and applauds as GREGOR steps onto the stage, arms open, welcoming the adulation. He comes to a stop in front of the microphone stand which is set too low.

GREGOR:
Thank you. Thank you. (blows a kiss to CIAOBELLA before seeing the stand) Do not worry. I will raise this myself. I'm only the head of the company, and after doing all the design work myself, I was looking forward to some menial work. (puts hands on the stand and is electrocuted)

The lights go out and women scream.

CIAOBELLA:
Gregor! Someone call... Call an ambulance! Somebody!  (runs to the stage and kneels beside GREGOR) Gregor! Gregor! Gregor!

GUS comes over to SHAWN and the two watch everything unfold.

SHAWN:
You absolutely sure you don't want to work tonight?

INT. CLUB, NIGHT

The models are sitting around waiting as the police arrive. SHAWN and GUS are sitting in a booth as two models, BRYAN and HASSENFEFFER, question them.

BRYAN:
You expect us to believe that you model?

SHAWN:
What? That's hard to believe? Whoa, me and my bro here aren't worthy of leering into a little camera lens or Blue Steeling it up occasionally?

HASSENFEFFER:
(German accent) Your bro, of course. His features are immaculate. But you, not so much.

SHAWN:
What? What are you, insane? Help...help me out here, Tan. (slaps GUS on the arm)

GUS:
He's a foot model.

BRYAN:
Well, that makes sense.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) Really? Thanks for that. (to models) He's lying. It was foot and ankle. And I did some hand work, okay? Perhaps you recognize this... (cups hands) from the insurance commercials.

HASSENFEFFER:
I have to go to the bathroom. (to BRYAN) Want to come?

BRYAN:
Okay.

HASSENFEFFER:
Ciao.

SHAWN watches the two models as they leave. GUS can't take his eyes off BERLINDA as she sits with other models.

GUS:
She seems so bored. So lonely.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but so does everybody here, dude. Did you notice that the mic stand was set too low when Gregor came out on the stage? Why would the mic stand be set so low when he's the only one who was gonna speak tonight?

GUS:
Do you see the clock?

SHAWN:
But what if we stumble upon something huge?

GUS:
What does the clock say, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Fine.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
Never mind. It's your birthday. No work, got it.

LASSITER and JULIET make their way through the club, approaching SHAWN and GUS' booth.

LASSITER:
All right, you will each, one by one, go to the area I've sequestered, state the name of the agency you work for and... (sees SHAWN and GUS) Why am I surprised?

SHAWN:
Usually it's because...

LASSITER:
Just tell me if you've seen anything. (sits next to SHAWN)

SHAWN:
Maybe. Do you suspect foul play?

LASSITER:
Not really. There's no one here with an IQ over 40.

SHAWN:
So, you're asking for our help.

GUS stomps on SHAWN'S foot under the table. JULIET looks under the table.

SHAWN:
(groans) Never mind. We're not available tonight. Wide open tomorrow, though.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS walk along the path to the porch. SHAWN is carrying the boots in his hand.

GUS:
What is this about, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Look, my dad insisted I return these by 8:00 A.M. I don't know about you, I plan on sleeping in till at least noon. Especially after we howl all night.

SHAWN bends over to leave the boots outside the door. Music and voices can be heard inside.

GUS:
Whoa. I think somebody's in there.

They hear a woman's laughter.

SHAWN:
No, that can't be. (peers through window and checks watch) Dude, it's 10:43. He's easily been asleep for two hours. (walks back to GUS)

GUS:
No, I think it's a woman. Listen.

WOMAN:
(muffled) I think there is someone here.

The door is opened and we see Chief VICK with a drink in her hand.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer. How unexpected.

SHAWN:
Chief? (stammers) I just came by to leave these half boots on the doormat. I didn't see anything.

Another woman appears next to VICK.

VICK:
Mr Spencer, please come in. Come in. (grabs SHAWN by the arm and pulls him inside)

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

GUS follows SHAWN inside.

VICK:
Mr Guster. (closes door and stands next to other woman) I just thought I'd bring my dear friend Susan over to meet your father. She's a lovely, single woman who works at city hall.

GUS:
Oh!

VICK'S cell phone rings.

VICK:
Excuse me. (answers phone) O'Hara, this better be big. You're still at Ciao? The electrical cabling's been tampered with? Okay. Well, this case just changed.

SHAWN listens in on the call.

SHAWN:
Dude...

GUS:
I will kill you, Shawn.

VICK:
All right, get any potentials down to the station. I am on my way. (ends call)(to SUSAN) You'll be okay?

SUSAN:
Yes.

VICK and SUSAN hug.

VICK:
Okay.

SUSAN:
Bye.

They end the hug.

VICK:
Bye, Henry! Thank you! (leaves)

HENRY enters the room from the kitchen, a beer bottle in his hand. He is surprised to see SHAWN and GUS.

HENRY:
What are you doing here?

SHAWN:
Well, we didn't realize it was ladies night at Club Henry. So I dropped by to return your half boots. (puts boots on bar)

SUSAN:
Wow, Henry, that's some wild-looking footwear.

HENRY:
Yeah... Susan, this is my son Shawn and, Gus.

SUSAN:
Nice to meet you. You can call me Sue. Most people call me Sue B. Because there are two Sues at the office. But obviously that's not really a factor here. (sips wine nervously)

HENRY:
Shawn, could you help me in the kitchen with these? (picks up two plates of hors d'oeuvres and hands one to SHAWN) Thank you. (to SUSAN) We'll be right back.

HENRY goes into the kitchen. As SHAWN follows, he looks back at GUS, completely puzzled.

GUS:
So... heard about Pluto? That's messed up.

SUSAN:
Yeah. (pours some more wine)

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, NIGHT

Once in the kitchen, SHAWN'S voice returns.

SHAWN:
Really, Dad? Cheese cubes and wieners? What's happening here? Is this some sort of blind date?

HENRY:
Sort of. I don't know. I mean... (looks out into the living room) She's just... what do you call it? Nondescript.

SHAWN:
"Nondescript"? I've never heard a woman described like that unless she was a robbery suspect.

HENRY:
I just don't know. I mean, she's pretty. She's a little boring and prim. I cubed these myself. She didn't even try one. What do you think? What's your opinion?

SHAWN:
I have no opinion of any kind whatsoever.

HENRY:
Shawn, come on. You have an opinion on everything. Especially when it comes to women. What... Just give me your first impression.

SHAWN:
No. (walks out)

HENRY:
Why not?

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS cross the yard back to the road.

GUS:
You have to get over this. Nobody wants to grow old alone. Maybe a nice lady will help him relax a little.

SHAWN:
New subject, Gus. Did you see the Chief run out of there? Must be something big. You know, I was thinking, there's only 73 minutes left in your birthday. (looks at watch) Actually, 72 minutes.

GUS:
Not until midnight, Shawn. I'm Cinderella, and this is my ball. And I'm not lifting a finger until my carriage turns into a big-ass pumpkin. Got it?

SHAWN:
Got it.

GUS:
Good.

INT. ARCADE, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are side-by-side sitting at a driving game. GUS gets carried away at the steering wheel. SHAWN only stares at him. They then stop to eat and GUS loads up his hot dog as SHAWN merely slurps his soda through a straw. He passes a napkin to GUS.

GUS:
Thank you.

The clock on the wall reads 11:18.

INT SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

The different models are waiting, all looking quite bored. JULIET and LASSITER enter the hall. JULIET sighs and makes her way through. LASSITER stops when one of the female models won't get out of his way. She looks down her nose at him and he moves around. Sitting on one of the benches along the wall is EMILY checking her phone.

JULIET:
Okay, where do you want all these people?

LASSITER:
Just put 'em in both interrogation rooms and we'll rove it. Let's go, go, go!

INT. ARCADE, NIGHT

GUS is aggressively playing air hockey, constantly defending his goal. SHAWN is standing at the other end holding the paddle in his hand but not using it. GUS still can't score a goal.

SHAWN:
So the electrical cable offstage was deliberately severed. The Chief thinks it was done pro. That means...

GUS scores a goal.

GUS:
Whoa! 6-5.

The clock reads 11:36.

INT SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, NIGHT

LASSITER and JULIET are sitting across from HASSENFEFFER.

LASSITER:
You don't remember where you were this afternoon?

HASSENFEFFER:
It was yellow. And boring.

JULIET:
Are we talking about a restaurant?

HASSENFEFFER:
I don't know, maybe. Just write down that it was lame. (to LASSITER) I do like that jacket.

LASSITER:
Really?

HASSENFEFFER:
Somewhere a transient is shivering in the night.

LASSITER slaps the table and stands to make a move towards HASSENFEFFER.

JULIET:
Detective.

INT. ARCADE, NIGHT

GUS and SHAWN are trying the dance machine and not doing very well. The round ends and SHAWN checks his watch before pointing to the clock on the wall. The seconds countdown to midnight.

GUS:
Fine, tell me what you got.

INT SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

LASSITER and JULIET walk up to SHAWN and GUS.

SHAWN:
How's it going, crime fighters?

JULIET:
They're not very forthcoming...or bright.

LASSITER:
One of them cannot confirm the correct spelling of his own name.

GUS:
Did you by chance interview a model named Berlinda? Is she still around?

JULIET:
Gus, we don't have time for this.

SHAWN:
I know, and that's why I'm here to offer our services.

LASSITER:
I'd rather shower with a bear.

SHAWN:
Look, they're only gonna talk to their own kind. Okay? Shallow, judgmental, cruel, and gorgeous. We're already imbedded.

VICK:
(walks up) What do you mean "imbedded"?

SHAWN:
Chief, we may or may not have used deception to get into the party tonight.

BRYAN and HASSENFEFFER walk up.

HASSENFEFFER:
See you at swimwear Wednesday.

BRYAN:
(to SHAWN) Don't let 'em scare you, Tan.

SHAWN:
He's Tan.

GUS:
Right.

BRYAN and HASSENFEFFER leave.

SHAWN:
They think we're models.

GUS:
They think I'm a model.

SHAWN:
Me too.

GUS:
A foot model.

SHAWN:
And ankle, Gus! Dude, that's just ridiculous anyway. Everybody look at my jaw.

SHAWN sucks in his cheeks and poses. GUS scoffs.

VICK:
Well, I've seen enough. You're hired.

LASSITER:
What?

VICK:
Hired. You can look the word up. It's... Change that tie, detective. Now, Mr Spencer, if you have a moment, I'd like to see you privately.

SHAWN:
Of course, Chief.

SHAWN raises his lip in a Billy Idol sneer before turning and following VICK down the hall to her office.

VICK:
Ciaobella and Gregor are home-grown celebrities. The local media is sharpening its pencils on this one.

INT SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, NIGHT

VICK:
And that is not the kind of press that this department or its interim chief needs. Do I make myself clear?

SHAWN:
Clear as a crystal ball.

VICK:
Good. So tell me... did your father say anything about my friend Susan?

EXT. MODELS' LOFT, DAY

SHAWN and GUS head up the stairs.

GUS:
They all live here?

SHAWN:
Well, Gregor owns the building. The Ciao studio's across the street. He uses this loft for his prime models.

GUS:
I wonder if it looks like the loft in Head Over Heels.

SHAWN:
You, and only you, can confirm that.

INT. MODELS' LOFT, LIVING AREA, DAY

CIAOBELLA is filling the gathered models in on the continuing plans for the company. EMILY is at her side, jotting notes in a journal.

CIAOBELLA:
My husband's funeral is tomorrow at 12:25. Be there no later than... 1:15. And I'll have to approve whatever you're wearing. Now, obviously, we have no choice but to continue with the fall line unveiling on Wednesday.

SHAWN and GUS enter the room quietly.

EMILY:
Ma'am, before we move on, should I hire someone to do magnolias tomorrow for the service?

CIAOBELLA:
Well, of course hire someone, Emily! It's not like they grow on trees.

GUS and SHAWN sneak up the stairs.

INT. MODELS' LOFT, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS reach the top of the stairs and cross the hall to start exploring the rooms.

GUS:
That marriage always seemed weird to me. Like when Liza Minnelli married David Gest.

SHAWN:
Yeah, well, Ciaobella and Gregor lasted eight years, Gus.

INT. MODELS' LOFT, BEDROOM, DAY

SHAWN lifts a plastic tote onto a bed as GUS goes to the closet.

SHAWN:
I suspect that some of those marble-chiseled simpletons are more devious than they let on. We're gonna have to dig deep and blend in in order to get real answers. (opens the tote)

GUS:
Dude, you thought I was gonna have trouble blending in? I have this shirt, this shirt. Most of these shirts. (takes a shoe from the shelf) And these are my exact Kenneth Coles. (sees framed photo) And that picture of my mom parasailing in Montego Bay. You moved me in?

SHAWN:
Dude, we got lucky. They just threw some guy out. Now we can live it up chic while we catch a killer. Now help me set up my Clapper.

GUS:
I'm not moving in here, Shawn. I don't care how many secrets we uncover.

A female MODEL wrapped in a towel leans against the door frame.

MODEL:
Shower's free. (looks at GUS)

GUS:
I got the window. (looks back at the MODEL)

INT. MODELS' LOFT, STAIRWELL, DAY

As SHAWN and GUS go downstairs, they meet up with the same model who stared at LASSITER.

SHAWN:
You must be Sigrid. What is that? Cossack?

SIGRID:
Die. (keeps walking)

SHAWN:
You can question her.

GUS:
You know who I'm questioning.

INT. MODELS' LOFT, LIVING AREA, DAY

SHAWN and GUS reach the bottom of the stairs to see HASSENFEFFER and BRYAN standing there, hands behind their backs.

SHAWN:
What's up, roomies?

The two models share a look.

BRYAN:
Initiation. That's what.

The models throw two silk-covered pillows at SHAWN and GUS.

HASSENFEFFER:
Put 'em up.

GUS:
I'm allergic to pillows.

SHAWN:
Tommy John, both elbows.

GUS and SHAWN reach the bottom of the stairs.

HASSENFEFFER:
Come on. Give me your best shot, Black. (pokes GUS with a pillow)

GUS backhands HASSENFEFFER with his pillow and he flies backwards over the couch. BRYAN rushes over to his friend as he lies on the floor.

SHAWN:
It would really behoove you guys to get our names right in the future.

BERLINDA walks down the stairs.

SHAWN:
Oh, good. Berlinda, you're here. Look, we are so out of the loop. You gotta catch us up on everything, you know. The dead Gregor thing, that awful Ciaobella, the agency...

GUS:
Maybe we can play Truth or Dare.

BERLINDA:
Actually, we were thinking about maybe going to a bar, doing some O2.

SHAWN:
Couldn't we do that after we talk? Because I know I have so many questions.

GUS:
I could be ready in three minutes. (passes pillow to SHAWN before hurrying upstairs)

BERLINDA smiles at SHAWN and walks away. SHAWN rolls his eyes.

EXT. ALLEY, NIGHT

The models - plus SHAWN and GUS - strut down the foggy alley to the strains of "Money" by the Pet Shop Boys.

HENRY:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Dad? (stops)

The others stop and look over at SHAWN and HENRY. BRYAN and HASSENFEFFER continue on. SIGRID and BERLINDA follow. Of course, GUS follows after BERLINDA.

SHAWN:
How did you find me?

HENRY:
Shawn, I was a detective for 15 years. You're not hard to find. (looks at the models as they reach the road) Was that guy wearing a bra?

SHAWN:
What could possibly be so important that you're here right now?

HENRY:
It's Karen's friend Susan. She called again. Twice in the last two days. Doesn't that reek of desperation?

SHAWN:
No, no, no. This is not happening.

SHAWN starts to go after the others but HENRY pulls him back by the arm.

HENRY:
Shawn, this is ridiculous! You come to me for advice on one of your stupid cases at least once a week. I ask for a simple assist on dating protocol, you can't give it to me? Call me old-fashioned, Shawn.

SHAWN looks over his shoulder as a big stretch limo arrives for the models.

GUS:
(pushes HASSENFEFFER out of the way) I don't think so. (gets into the limo)

HENRY:
I haven't been pursued by a woman in 33 years. It used to be the other way around, you know.

SHAWN:
Okay, fine, dad, look. Women your age, they don't have time to play games.

SHAWN looks again to see the limo pull away.

HENRY:
She was wearing a cardigan!

SHAWN:
But she saw the inside of your house, and didn't run screaming in horror. Ride the upside. Now, I can't talk about this for one more second because I'm proud of the fact that I have never been in therapy, okay? Goodbye. (backs away from HENRY'S grasp)

HENRY:
Shawn. No! Shawn!

SHAWN jogs to the end of the alley and looks for the limo. Not seeing it, he pulls out his cell phone and dials.

INT. LIMO, NIGHT

The models are partying in the limo, drinking champagne - Sigrid, from the bottle. GUS is laughing like he's trying to fit in when his phone rings.

GUS:
Hello.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

EXT. ALLEY, NIGHT

SHAWN:
Dude, what the hell happened to you guys?

GUS:
Some of the models got creeped out that you hang with your dad all the time.

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
All right, fine! We were afraid if we hung out with him any longer, we might catch wrinkles. (laughs)

SHAWN:
Just tell me where you're going.

GUS:
Shawn, I can't talk now.

SHAWN:
Gus, you're not being helpful. And we have a case to...

GUS ends the call.

SHAWN:
...solve.

SHAWN looks over and sees EMILY let herself into the Ciao building with a key. He closes his phone and goes over.

INT. CIAO, OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN enters the room where EMILY is looking over some sketches. Her back is to the door and she doesn't see SHAWN enter.

SHAWN:
Miss Bloom.

EMILY gives a startled gasp and drops the papers from her hand.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

They both kneel on the floor to pick up the papers which are design sketches.

EMILY:
It's okay.

SHAWN:
I'm Black...

EMILY:
I know who you are. You're staying at the loft. You're the one no one believes used to be a model.

SHAWN:
Who's saying these things?

They stand.

EMILY:
I believe you.

SHAWN:
Thank you.

EMILY:
I think your ankles are magnificent.

SHAWN:
Well, I play a lot of ping-pong.

EMILY laughs. SHAWN notices the sketches have EMILY'S initials. He looks over them.

SHAWN:
Wow, these are really good.

EMILY:
Thank you. I've never really shown them to anyone before.

SHAWN:
Why not? I'd totally wear these. This if I was very confused. (holds up a sketch of a bikini and matching robe)

EMILY:
(laughs) Yes. You know, I just let Gregor and Ciaobella do the designs. It's Ciaobella's company now. Well, my lunch break is over.

SHAWN:
It's after 9:00.

EMILY:
Yeah, I kinda work long hours. (sighs) I'm just so far behind, Ciaobella's gonna freak. (crosses room) I've gotta get back to work.

SHAWN:
Okay.

EMILY:
Will I see you tomorrow at the funeral?

SHAWN:
Yes, definitely. (stammers) Um, yeah. I think so, yeah.

EMILY:
Okay. Good. (leaves)

SHAWN:
Well, don't work too hard.

SHAWN walks up to a full-length mirror and makes poses. Realizing what he's doing, he backs away and leaves.

EXT. MODELS' LOFT, NIGHT

SHAWN is listening to GUS' outgoing voicemail message.

GUS:
"Hi, you've reached Burton Guster with Central Coast Pharmaceuticals. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you."

SHAWN:
Straight to voice mail? That's how we're doing it now? One moderately hot chick comes by, and suddenly I'm invisible? You know what, Gus? That's fine. I'm taking the bunk next to the window. And don't be surprised if your pillow smells faintly of my butt. (ends call)

INT. MODELS' LOFT, BEDROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN, wearing boxers and a T-shirt, sits on the bed by the closet. He then lies on his back. After a moment, he claps his hands twice and the lights go out.

INT. MODELS' LOFT, LIVING AREA, DAY

SHAWN comes down the stairs still in his boxers and T-shirt with bed-head and yawning. The models and GUS are sitting at the table or counter already dressed and looking like they've been awake for hours already.

SHAWN:
What is this? Did you guys get up at dawn? Dude, you couldn't give me a little shake?

HASSENFEFFER:
We got up five minutes ago.

SIGRID enters the room behind SHAWN, already in black with large sunglasses.

BERLINDA:
Sigrid, we can all go together.

SIGRID:
I would rather eat my own earlobes than spend another hour with you callous monsters. (leaves)

HASSENFEFFER:
That girl's acting like a freak.

SHAWN clears his throat and looks at GUS. After a slight hesitation, GUS gets up and walks over to join SHAWN at the base of the stairs.

SHAWN:
Did you accomplish anything last night besides selling me out for vacant head?

GUS:
Yes, I did. I found out that Berlinda always wanted a pet dwarf bunny as a child. And she loves anything that smells and looks like lavender.

SHAWN:
Sweet. Let's call the Chief and get paid.

GUS:
I also found out that Ciaobella was grilling all of the models because she was convinced that one of them was sleeping with Gregor.

They both look over at the models.

SHAWN:
Really?

GUS:
Yep.

SHAWN:
Well that coupled with the fact that she's drunk with power, treating her sweet little assistant like dirt, give us a pretty good suspect, I'd say. Let's crash a funeral.

EXT. FUNERAL, DAY

A white oriental-style pagoda draped in black houses GREGOR'S open casket. Guests walk past to pay their respects. In front are black folding chairs with black canopies off to the side covering the food and drinks.

BERLINDA:
Oh, my God. Is he wearing Hugo Boss? What a sellout! See you never.

BRYAN:
Good night forever... you bald bastard.

HASSENFEFFER:
(into phone) Hold on. (to GREGOR) It was me who peed in the hot tub. (into phone) Okay, I hear you. I'll have to talk...

GUS:
You reap what you sow, Uwe-Steeb. Remember that.

SHAWN:
(follows GUS) You don't even know that dude.

GUS:
I'm in character, Shawn. Besides, Berlinda's listening. Shut up.

They move over to the canopy set up as a bar and look out at the gathered guests. EMILY sees SHAWN and waves.

SHAWN:
You know what, man? I didn't want to tell you this. (waves back) Berlinda's the one that couldn't spell her own name.

GUS:
So? You don't know her like I do, Shawn.

SHAWN watches as SIGRID stops to pay her respects. She is holding a note bearing a lipstick kiss with a heart drawn over it.

SHAWN:
Dude!

GUS:
What?

SIGRID slips the note into the pocket of GREGOR'S shirt.

SHAWN:
(whispers) That was a love note. That's a love note. That's a love note. She just hid a love note in the casket. That means Sigrid was Gregor's mistress. Ciaobella found out about it and killed him. I got it!

SHAWN starts to do his "I Solved the Case" dance and GUS grabs his arms.

GUS:
You can't dance at a funeral, Shawn.

SHAWN:
All of a sudden you're the arbiter of good taste?

GUS:
We wait until it's over, and we do it without blowing my cover to Berlinda. She only dates models.

SHAWN:
Wow. Fine, I'll call Jules.

SHAWN and GUS pick up their drinks and move to take their seats for the service.

>>> LATER >>>

JULIET and LASSITER arrive as CIAOBELLA clears her throat and walks to the center of the pagoda. SIGRID is the only one crying.

CIAOBELLA:
Well, thank you all for coming. We gather today not to mourn the passing of my dead husband... (sees HASSENFEFFER on the phone) Hassenfeffer! But rather to celebrate all that he once was. While I will always miss Gregor Uwe-Steeb, whose real name was Gregory Lipstanski, I encourage you all not to cry. But to drink and laugh and dance as we remember a man who once thought a belt made of dried bits of panther was a good idea. Good-bye, my love. Oh, Gregor.

CIAOBELLA leans over and kisses GREGOR. She soon deepens the kiss, gripping his head in both hands.

SHAWN:
Wow, she's really planting one on him, huh?

CIAOBELLA goes slack.

EMILY:
Miss Masterson? (stands and hurries to CIAOBELLA) Ciaobella? Ciaobella?

EMILY touches CIAOBELLA'S shoulder and the woman rolls over. EMILY screams and one of the men from the funeral parlor(?) comforts her. The crowd exclaims and HASSENFEFFER takes a photo with his camera.

MAN:
She's not breathing!

JULIET and LASSITER run up to examine CIAOBELLA.

SHAWN:
I've changed my mind. It wasn't the wife.

INT SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET are sitting across from SIGRID as she loudly blows her nose.

SIGRID:
I loved Gregor, and he loved me.

LASSITER:
But he wasn't gonna leave his wife, and you never learned to share as a child, so you went ahead and killed them both. For symmetry. Sound about right?

SIGRID:
No, it wasn't like that. I mean, sure, it was frustrating. I couldn't say anything about her without him flying off the handle.

INT SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, DAY

GUS and SHAWN watch the interrogation.

SIGRID:
He wouldn't even let me drink out of the same glass as her. He said that comparing me to her was like comparing Cleopatra to Miss Cleo.

GUS:
You think Berlinda's back at the loft?

SHAWN:
That analogy doesn't make any sense.

GUS:
It would if you knew who either of them were.

SIGRID:
But I was sharing. I accepted it.

INT SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

SIGRID:
A piece of him was enough. I mean, it was that or nothing. (wails) I miss him so much. He was the only one that knew how to accentuate my shoulders to make my waist and hips look smaller.

JULIET:
You realize you had more motive than anyone, Sigrid.

SIGRID:
No. Now Emily Bloom has taken over sole creative control of Ciao. I mean, she inherits everything.

INT SBPD, OBSERVATION ROOM, DAY

SHAWN:
Emily Bloom?

GUS:
Who?

INT SBPD, INTERROGATION ROOM, DAY

LASSITER:
The mousy assistant?

SIGRID:
She started as an assistant. That's just how they treated her. But she's third in line.

LASSITER:
Interesting. She failed to mention that little factoid.

SIGRID:
Is that the same suit you...

LASSITER:
Yes, okay? It is! I can get more than one wearing out of a suit in a work week.

SIGRID:
It's the same tie.

LASSITER:
(stands and points to the door) Get out of here!

INT SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET follow SIGRID up the stairs from interrogation.

LASSITER:
Don't go getting any ideas about hopping a plane to Trinidad and Tobago. You're not out of the woods yet, missy.

SHAWN and GUS wait for SIGRID to leave before joining LASSITER and JULIET.

SHAWN:
What's the plan, Stan?

LASSITER:
Go away. The reason we brought you in on this case was so that people would stop dying. O'Hara, get down to Ciao. I want you to put the clamps on Miss Bloom, our little Kiwi ladder-climber.

JULIET:
Check.

JULIET and LASSITER leave in opposite directions.

INT. CIAO, HALL, DAY

JULIET follows a young man, WILLIAM, through the narrow halls. We hear EMILY.

EMILY:
Then I will pay the penalty to terminate the contract. (enters the hall) William, will you please make sure those pleather samples make it to Alicia Silverstone before 3:00?

WILLIAM:
Don't even give it another thought.

JULIET:
Miss Bloom?

INT. CIAO, WORKROOM, DAY

EMILY speaks into her Bluetooth.

EMILY:
No, a bunny does not need to go blind in order to confirm that our buyers should not eat our clothing. How would you like it if I doused your retina in henna, you Cro-Magnon piece of...

JULIET:
I'm Detective O'Hara from the...

EMILY:
Screw you! (ends call and looks at a design sketch) Let's acknowledge the curve, Samantha. You know, real women, real figures. Just raise the waist line. Make it an "A" cut. (picks up protein drink and continues on) And don't think for one second I didn't notice your new bangs. You look 21 again. (stops to initial a sketch)

JULIET:
Miss Bloom, I need to ask you a few questions.

EMILY:
And we're walking.

INT. CIAO, OFFICE, DAY

JULIET follows EMILY to the adjoining room.

JULIET:
We believe that both your predecessors were killed by the same person.

EMILY:
And no one stood to gain more than I did by killing them both?

JULIET:
Well, I'm glad you can see where this is headed. I'll need you to account for your whereabouts.

WILLIAM enters the room.

WILLIAM:
Now it's just the prototype, (holds up a pair of red pumps) but I've never wanted to be a woman this badly in my life.

EMILY:
Okay. (to JULIET) Can you try these on?

JULIET:
I don't think that's appropriate.

WILLIAM pushes her down into a chair and slips the shoes onto her feet.

JULIET:
Wait, excuse me! What? Oh, wow. (laughs) Wow. (stands) These are fabulous.

The workers in the room applaud.

JULIET:
Now, are we talking in your office or mine?

EMILY:
Okay, back to work, everybody. (everyone else leaves) William, order pizza for everybody. That yummy place with the soy ricotta. Thank you. (WILLIAM leaves) Well, this is my office, so fire away.

While EMILY was talking to WILLIAM, JULIET noticed a banner that reads "Ciao! Ciao! We Love You Emily".

JULIET:
You've been head of this company for six hours, and you've changed just about everything. You're not exactly preserving the Ciao legacy.

EMILY:
You know, I have all these things I've always wanted to do. And I'm turning the company green. I'm ending animal testing. Subsidizing proceeds to help find a cure for breast cancer. Do any of those sound like bad things to you?

JULIET:
Unfortunately, that's not an alibi.

EMILY:
No, it isn't. And what's more, I don't think I have one. I mean, I was with them all day every day.

JULIET:
I see. Well, I'm sure you won't mind if I have a look around and chat with a few of your employees?

EMILY:
No, of course not.

JULIET:
That's it, Miss Bloom. (starts to walk away)

EMILY:
Detective, aren't you forgetting something?

JULIET:
(stops and realizes she's still wearing the shoes) Oh. Right. (takes off shoes)

EMILY:
You know, you have such great lines. There's no reason why you can't dress to arrest. Is there?

JULIET stands up a little straighter.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN is sitting at his desk researching online as GUS stands in front of a mirror and rubs oil onto his head.

SHAWN:
All right, what do we know about Emily Bloom?

GUS:
Well, she wrote, Are You There, God? It's Me Margaret, and Freckle Juice.

SHAWN:
I think that was Judy Blume.

GUS:
Oh. Then I got nothin'.

SHAWN:
Could you possibly be bringing less to the table right now?

GUS:
Shawn, you're just upset because I'm more than a pair of ankles.

SHAWN:
I don't get it. Emily Bloom was the vice president of the company, yet she was running coffee and balancing the books? (looks at GUS) Dude, are you oiling your head?

GUS turns away from the mirror to face SHAWN.

GUS:
Lavender. Berlinda likes her men to shine.

The office phone rings and SHAWN picks it up. The screen splits to show VICK at her office.

SHAWN:
Chief.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, I'm going to ask you a very important question, and I'd appreciate some candor.

SHAWN:
Shoot.

VICK:
Has your father lost his mind? I mean, why hasn't he called my friend Susan back? Honestly, he should be so lucky.

SHAWN:
Chief, I cannot get involved in some sort of soap opera starring my father. For the record, I told him he should...

VICK'S other line rings.

VICK:
Hold on. (puts SHAWN on hold and answers the other line) This is Vick.

The screen splits on VICK'S side, showing SUSAN on top.

SUSAN:
He asked me out.

VICK:
Wonderful! Oh, my gosh. What did he say?

SUSAN:
Oh, well, he left a message.

VICK:
Oh, yeah, that sounds like Henry.

SHAWN'S phone rings and he picks it up. The screen splits pushing VICK and SUSAN off-screen to show HENRY.

SHAWN:
Dad?

HENRY:
Should I take her to Crab Shack Willie's or the Third Wharf?

SHAWN:
Those can't possibly be real places.

The screen splits into quarters showing all four and the conversations overlap. SHAWN seems to be the only one not wanting any part of it.

SHAWN:
Look, Dad, I'm really busy, okay?

VICK:
Do not bring your purse into the restaurant.

HENRY:
Shawn, just pick a restaurant.

[Split screen of VICK and SUSAN]

SUSAN:
Listen, I'm gonna call him back.

VICK:
Okay, call me later, honey.

SUSAN:
Okay.

VICK ends the call.

[Split screen of SHAWN and HENRY]

SHAWN:
I don't know where you should take her to dinner!

HENRY'S phone beeps.

HENRY:
Hold on. That's her. Gotta go. (ends call)

[Split screen of SHAWN and VICK]

BOTH:
He called her.

VICK:
Now stop messing around and go find me a killer. Good-bye. (ends call)

Stunned by the whole call juggling, SHAWN sighs and replaces the phone. He stands and looks over at GUS who is wearing a different shirt and boxers as he stands in front of the mirror.

SHAWN:
Am I dreaming?

GUS:
Nope. I just look this good.

SHAWN:
How is it possible that I am the only sane person in the universe right now?

GUS:
(turns to face SHAWN) Question. Do you think this shirt enhances or detracts from my traps? Berlinda's going to get me into the fashion show.

SHAWN:
(looks at GUS' shirt) Have you worn that before?

GUS:
Nope. This shirt was designed by Gregor Uwe-Steeb, Shawn. It's a part of the new fall line.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. CLUB, NIGHT

GREGOR:
I'm only the head of the company, and after doing all the design work myself...

INT. CIAO, OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN notices the sketches have EMILY'S initials. He looks over them.

SHAWN:
Wow, these are really good.

EMILY:
Thank you. I've never really shown them to anyone before.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. PSYCH, DAY

One of the sketches SHAWN looked at in the office is the exact shirt GUS is wearing.

SHAWN:
That is not Gregor's design.

GUS:
What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
They're stealing her designs.

GUS:
Whose?

SHAWN:
Emily's. Gregor said he personally designed the whole new line. He's full of it. That's Emily's. I've seen it. They're all Emily's. Would you please put some pants on?

INT. RESTAURANT, NIGHT

HENRY and SUSAN are looking over the menu.

HENRY:
The fish and chips is actually pretty good.

SUSAN:
I've been craving meat lately.

HENRY:
Well, in that case the prime rib is excellent.

SUSAN reaches down to the seat beside her and puts a six-pack of beer on the table.

SUSAN:
B.Y.O.B. Help yourself.

HENRY:
(looks around) No, no, actually, I don't think it is.

SUSAN:
Is it hot in here? (pulls off sweater to show black camisole)

HENRY:
I don't think so. It's pretty comfortable. (eyes widen)

SUSAN:
Whew, that's better. Don't you think?

HENRY raises his eyes from her chest to her face and smiles nervously before looking away.

INT SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the station. LASSITER enters from the opposite side carrying a bag from "The Tie Supply" and wearing a new blue tie. Upon seeing the others, he tosses the bag behind a potted palm. The three of them meet in the center and look down the hall in front of them, stunned expressions on their faces. JULIET has taken EMILY'S words to heart and is wearing a new black skirt and belted black jacket over a low-cut black top. She smiles at them as she enters VICK'S office. SHAWN clears his throat and the three men also enter VICK'S office.

INT SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK is closing a cabinet drawer and turns around to see JULIET.

VICK:
What happened to you?

JULIET:
I am a woman, Chief. And I am choosing to dress like one.

LASSITER:
You can't do that, O'Hara.

JULIET:
I paid for it myself. I was feeling good about myself, it was my lunch break and... Carlton, is that a new tie?

LASSITER:
Don't be ridiculous.

JULIET smiles.

VICK:
I trust this is all in aid of something?

JULIET:
Yes, Chief. I spent the entire afternoon at Ciao, and I am certain that Emily Bloom is not our killer. I grilled her, she didn't break. Not to mention she has over a dozen employees that would take a bullet for her. She simply doesn't have it in her to kill somebody, much less two somebodies. I'd bet the farm on it.

SHAWN:
(raises hands to head) I'm sensing something. Gregor and Ciaobella were stealing Emily's designs. Stealing them, passing them off as their own. All the while treating her as a peon.

VICK:
That's not a bad start for motive.

LASSITER:
(opens file) Toxicology report. Ciaobella was poisoned. The only thing in her system were traces of arsenic, soy milk, and green super food powder.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. CLUB, NIGHT

SHAWN remembers CIAOBELLA drinking her green protein shake that had been handed to her by EMILY.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN:
Bad news, Jules. I think you just lost the farm.

INT. RESTAURANT, NIGHT

SUSAN is buttering a roll as HENRY nibbles on his fries.

SUSAN:
Would you like me to butter your biscuit?

HENRY:
Excuse me?

SUSAN reaches over, grips HENRY'S hand and seductively bites off the end of the fry. She never takes her eyes off him, even as she sits back down. HENRY, out of his depth, looks down at his dinner.

HENRY:
So what's it like working for the mayor?

SUSAN:
It's okay. It'd be more fun if he wasn't married though. So what's it like being retired? I mean, you're not that old, so what's the story? You take a slug? Or did you just get tired of being good all the time? Now be honest... (stands and feeds HENRY a piece of meat) Isn't that better than some flaky piece of fish?

HENRY can't help but look straight at her cleavage.

HENRY:
That's good. (starts chewing) Very good.

SUSAN:
Yeah?

HENRY:
Yeah, that's good.

SUSAN sits back down. HENRY nudges his fork so it falls to the floor.

HENRY:
Oh, damn it, damn it. Damn it, I dropped my fork, I... I'll just get one myself. (hurries from the table)

INT. CIAO, RECEPTION, NIGHT

JULIET leads the others towards the office.

JULIET:
Okay, for the record, I still don't feel right about this.

SHAWN'S phone rings and he hangs back to answer.

SHAWN:
Dad, I thought you were supposed to be...

[Split screen with HENRY in the restaurant hall]

HENRY:
Shawn, I was wrong. She's like this carnivorous mink. She wants to eat me right here...

SUSAN comes up behind HENRY, grabs the phone from his hand and pushes him into the men's room.

SHAWN:
(closes phone) That was weird.

INT. CIAO, WORKROOM, NIGHT

They walk towards the workroom and can hear a sewing machine. LASSITER pulls out his gun in the doorway.

JULIET:
Oh, come on!

LASSITER puts his gun away as they continue on. They see EMILY sprawled out at one of the work desks, light on and machine running. JULIET hurries over and unplugs the sewing machine.

JULIET:
(walks back to others) So, Shawn, still feel like she's our killer?

SHAWN:
Whoa. Three dead bodies?

EMILY suddenly comes to with a gasp and the others scream. JULIET covers her mouth with her hands.

VICK:
Detectives, go call an ambulance. (hurries to EMILY)

SHAWN:
Holy crap! (follows VICK)

JULIET and LASSITER hurry from the room.

INT. HOSPITAL, HALL, NIGHT

JULIET is on the phone outside EMILY'S room.

JULIET:
She's stable now. They've pumped her stomach. I have a sample on the way to the lab.

INT. HOSPITAL, ROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN is sitting at the foot of EMILY'S bed, resting his head on his hand. He sighs and lowers his arm. EMILY slowly wakes up.

SHAWN:
(sits forward) Emily.

EMILY:
Black. Wh-what are you doing here?

SHAWN:
(stands) It's a long story that you don't really need to hear. How do you feel?

EMILY:
Not terrible. I just...I can't remember anything that happened after I finished, my dinner.

SHAWN:
Dinner. What did you have?

EMILY:
Well, the pizza was gone, so I just had a super food smoothie and some Tofurkey jerky.

SHAWN:
Oh, my God.

EMILY:
What? I was really hungry, and I just wanted something quickly.

SHAWN starts bouncing up and down excitedly.

SHAWN:
No, no, no, I've gotta go solve... I'm... I-m... I'm really glad, though, that you're feeling... That you're not, um... My name is... How 'bout I come back later?

EMILY:
Yeah, I'd like that.

SHAWN:
Sweet! (knocks on window by JULIET and runs out of the room)

INT. CLUB, NIGHT

The club is holding a memorial service for the designers.

WOMAN ON PA:
Gregor and Ciaobella...

SHAWN and GUS cross the floor.

SHAWN:
I'm all over the second and third halves with these smoothies. All the models that would have benefited from killing Gregor and Ciaobella have no reason to kill Emily too, I don't think. What's the missing link?

GUS:
Right, put a pin in it, and I'll make my move on Berlinda, and we'll pick it up in the morning.

WOMAN ON PA:
Only a few know that their actual wedding took place in a private ceremony on the small Bahamian island of Abaco two years earlier. Today would have been their tenth wedding anniversary.

BERLINDA waves at GUS and he makes to walk over but SHAWN grabs him by the arm.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa. Did you know that?

GUS:
No, Shawn. I'm not interested in learning new trivia about our murder victims.

SHAWN:
Ten years is a milestone anniversary in this state, Gus. Financially, it's a benchmark. It means all the assets get split right down the middle.

GUS:
We're not gonna solve this thing tonight, Shawn.

SHAWN:
I know part of it. I might even know 2/3 of it. Dude, I could totally go up there.

GUS:
But you won't.

LASSITER and JULIET enter with a uniformed officer.

LASSITER:
All right, Spencer, we did a rush tox screen on Emily.

JULIET:
You were right. She had the same poison in her system as Ciaobella, but in a much higher dose.

SHAWN:
(puts hands to head) I definitely know 2/3 of it!

GUS:
(pulls SHAWN aside) Stop it, Shawn. Don't do it. Don't just get up there and start winging it. That's not how we operate.

SHAWN:
Dude, where have you been for the last two years?

GUS:
Come on, Shawn. I'm so close.

BERLINDA comes up and wraps her arm around GUS' and takes him away.

LASSITER:
Would you tell us why we're here?

SHAWN holds up a hand as he watches the video.

WOMAN ON PA:
Never afraid to take risks, Ciaobella's dress of electric lights set the Paris fashion world ablaze...

SHAWN:
Oh, my God, this is a doozy. I mean, wow. (walks forward)

WOMAN ON PA:
...establishing her as one of the top designers working today.

SHAWN goes up the steps to the stage and takes the microphone from the stand.

SHAWN:
Stop the projector!

The video keeps going. The crowd ignores him.

SHAWN:
Or... or just keep it going. That's... that's fine. I know this may be hard for some of you to believe, but I'm not really Black. And I'm not a model. My partner Gus and I are detectives.

BERLINDA:
You're not a model?

GUS:
I'm only a detective part-time. And my full name is Tangus.

BERLINDA exclaims in disgust and walks away.

SHAWN:
(points to picture of CIAOBELLA) Ciaobella Masterson was murdered by her husband, (points to picture of GREGOR) Gregor Uwe-Steeb. (struts across the stage)

LASSITER:
Wait, wait, wait. That doesn't make any sense. Gregor was already dead.

SHAWN:
Do I come down to your office and bother you while you're working?

LASSITER:
All the time.

SHAWN:
That's fair. Gregor was having an affair. [SIGRID slips the love note into GREGOR'S pocket] He couldn't chance getting caught. Not with his tenth wedding anniversary approaching. He was desperate to get out of the marriage without losing half of his company. [GREGOR puts poison into the blender] So he poisoned Ciaobella's green super food powder. Only she wouldn't die... because she was bulimic. Ciaobella couldn't keep anything she ate down. [CIAOBELLA puts two fingers down her throat - SHAWN noticed the discoloration earlier] That's why it took forever for the poison to take effect. All Gregor could do was wait...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, DAY

SIGRID:
He wouldn't even let me drink out of the same glass as her.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. CLUB, NIGHT

SHAWN:
And keep his vampire mistress away from the poisonous elements.

Sobbing, SIGRID runs from the room.

SHAWN:
But Ciaobella knew of the affair, and had herself a mind for murder. Using her own skills with electricity, [CIAOBELLA fixes the electric dress] she laid a trap for Gregor [GREGOR holds the mic stand] before his plan was complete. What's up?!

GUS shakes his head. LASSITER and JULIET merely look puzzled. BRYAN and HASSENFEFFER are stunned.

LASSITER:
What about Emily?

JULIET:
Emily was drinking a super food smoothie the day she took over.

SHAWN:
Really, Jules? You too?

JULIET:
I'm sorry.

SHAWN:
Is this just a free-for-all? Anybody can just bounce in anytime they want?

JULIET:
I'm sorry.

SHAWN:
In summation, Ciaobella killed Gregor. Gregor killed Ciaobella. Emily got caught in the green powdery crossfire. But not before she designed the new fall line. It's revolutionary, by the way. We all deserve to feel beautiful.

LASSITER:
(holds up handcuffs) What am I supposed to do with these?

SHAWN:
Nothing. Put 'em away. I guess what I'm saying is... you're all free to go. That was crazy, right?

Nobody moves. SHAWN goes back to JULIET and LASSITER.

LASSITER:
You could have told me that over the phone. Hell, you could've put it in an email. (to JULIET) Come on.

LASSITER and JULIET leave. GUS walks over to SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Dude, did you see that? That was, like, the most stylish wrap-up ever. Except for the part where there was no one to accuse. But whatever, right? It was hot. (GUS walks away) Gus. Gus?

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

HENRY is standing by the window. He's wearing a black turtleneck. SHAWN enters from the kitchen.

SHAWN:
All right, here I am. Why are you dressed like Perry Como?

HENRY:
Thanks for coming, Son.

SHAWN:
You said it was important. (chuckles) Clearly, you're about to shoot an Old Spice commercial.

HENRY:
That's funny. Look, Shawn, I just... I need to talk to you. You know, face-to-face.

SHAWN:
I got it. You've been invited to a very special screening of Bullitt.

HENRY:
I'm going on another date with Susan.

SHAWN:
What, the woman you described as a carnivorous mink?

HENRY:
I'll admit her behavior threw me a little off balance, but the night ended up being a lot of fun.

SHAWN:
Oh, my God. You have a hickey!

HENRY:
Shawn, Shawn. (fiddles with his collar)

SHAWN:
You called me over here to show off your hickey?! That's sick!

HENRY:
Shawn, no! No, I called you over here because... I don't want to feel guilty about moving on with my life. Your mother's not a part of it anymore. She hasn't been for a long time. She is not coming back. And I hope she's happy. Yeah... I mean that. She deserves it. But my life is here, Shawn. And I don't want to have to sneak around trying to live it.

SHAWN:
I can't deal with this right now. (starts to walk away)

HENRY:
Well, Shawn, you have to.

SHAWN:
(angry) Look, I don't care what you do, okay? I don't care. I just don't want to hear about it. So don't call me on the phone asking me for advice. And don't expect me to meet you and your new dominatrix girlfriend for dinner.

HENRY:
All right, look. Kid, this is not easy for me either.

SHAWN:
Yeah, it never was. Have a nice date.

SHAWN sighs and walks away only to stop in the doorway to the kitchen. He slaps the wall before turning back.

SHAWN:
And unless you plan on taking her to Wayne Manor, lose the turtleneck, okay? Let her admire her work. And remember, you treat a woman like a person, and then a princess, and then a Greek goddess...

HENRY:
And then a person again.

SHAWN:
Right. Okay. (leaves)

Episode 2x16 Shawn (and Gus) of the Dead

Yes! Season 2 is done! Not sure when I'll get to 3, but I will, promise.


1987

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

HENRY and MRS SPENCER are snuggled on the couch watching "The Creature from the Black Lagoon" and eating popcorn. There is a thunderstorm outside.

MRS. SPENCER:
(stands) Hon, I'm gonna grab a drink. (heads for kitchen)

HENRY:
Wanna get me one too, sweetie?

MRS. SPENCER:
Okay.

SHAWN sneaks down the stairs and peers around the wall. He is very scared. On the couch, HENRY hears the stair creak and turns around but doesn't see anything. He turns back to the TV. SHAWN peers around the wall again and the couch is empty. SHAWN leans around a little further and HENRY pops his head out.

HENRY:
Shawn. What are you doing? You were supposed to be asleep two hours ago.

SHAWN:
I was watching. And then I know I shouldn't, but then... I didn't want to go back upstairs. I was scared.

HENRY:
All right. (picks up SHAWN and takes him to the couch) Now listen, now you know that none of this is real, right? It's all make-believe. People do not become bloodthirsty monsters after they get shot. In fact, I've had a lot of experience in the field with puncture wounds, and there's no way a giant dart to the lungs creates a 6-inch hole visible from the other side.

SHAWN:
Really?

HENRY:
No way! I mean, maybe the blood-engorged cavity will become purple and expand and perhaps even explode...I've seen that. (HENRY sees SHAWN'S wide eyes) Look, dead bodies do not walk, son. Sometimes they suddenly blink or jolt for a second, but... Mostly they just wither and smell... And drizzle and ooze.

SHAWN smiles nervously and looks at the TV where the Creature is trapped and roars.

HENRY:
All right, now go to bed. Sleep tight.

SHAWN slowly moves away from the couch and towards the stairs.

PRESENT

INT. MUSEUM, NIGHT

LASSITER and JULIET pass through the exhibits.

LASSITER:
A museum? 4:00 in the morning for a museum and not even the one downtown? Hey, the paper come out yet?

JULIET:
I don't know. They running another story on the Wyles death?

They reach a room where some officers are stationed. JULIET splits from LASSITER, putting an exhibit wall between them.

LASSITER:
I don't know. Perhaps. Gosh, I hadn't even thought about that.

JULIET:
(rejoins him) Carlton, you're name's been in every article they've printed since you've reopened the case.

LASSITER:
Has it? I try not to read the papers too much... Very skewed. No, I was just gonna look at the classified ads. I mean, you know I've been looking for a new Bob's Big Boy, right?

BUZZ finds them in a room of medieval armor.

BUZZ:
I got it, Detective. Press operator from The Mirror gave me an advanced copy. But there's nothing about you or Wyles in there.

LASSITER takes the paper from BUZZ and searches it.

LASSITER:
What? Impossible. I leaked that stuff about the will getting changed yesterday.

BUZZ:
Hey, did you say you were looking for a Big Boy, like a full-size?

LASSITER:
(shoves the paper at BUZZ) Go away. Thing's a rag anyway.

LASSITER and JULIET continue on. A MAN in a suit hands a young woman a tape.

MAN:
Security tape, Ms. Bridgewell.

JULIET:
(holds out hand) Hi, I'm Detective O'Hara.

BRIDGEWELL:
(shakes JULIET'S hand) Sophie.

LASSITER:
Wait, you're the curator?

SOPHIE:
Assistant curator.

LASSITER:
I'd like to speak to someone in charge.

SOPHIE:
I am in charge.

JULIET:
She sounds in charge.

LASSITER looks at JULIET.

SOPHIE:
The mummy room's this way. Please follow me. (leads the way)

LASSITER:
Where's the curator?

SOPHIE:
He's in Egypt procuring the rest of this collection, but I assure you...

JULIET:
There's no need. He's been working all night. Can you catch us up?

SOPHIE:
This exhibit just opened yesterday. I don't know how this is possible.

LASSITER:
It was a prank or some sort of dare.

SOPHIE:
It's a 3,000-year-old mummy that's missing, officer.

LASSITER:
It's Detective. And it's not like it was covered in gold. I mean he wasn't a king or a prince or even a royal food taster. He was just some guy who happened to die, got himself wrapped up, and was found in a pretty, cracked box. He probably mummified himself.

JULIET:
He hasn't had his coffee yet. Has anyone found the night watchman?

SOPHIE:
I'm afraid not.

LASSITER:
Night watchman. (opens file) Douglas F. Hastings, 47, three counts of felony burglary on his record.

JULIET:
Technically, burglary is a felony.

LASSITER:
Two charges dropped. Don't you people run background checks?

SOPHIE:
Doug was a very good employee who's been here seven years. And we have a complex security system.

LASSITER:
Which was due to be overhauled last spring.

SOPHIE:
We pushed it back. We have a very abulic board of Directors.

LASSITER:
Good, I'd like to speak with each one of them as soon as the sun rises. Now if you'll forgive us, we have several high-profile cases that don't involve archaic security systems in rundown buildings. O'Hara, put out an APB on the guard's vehicle, look up the word "abulic" and meet us back at the station.

SOPHIE:
Just a minute! I don't know who you are, Detective, but this was no prank. The alarm was triggered from the inside. And although our archaic security footage was limited to rotating shots of the four main rooms, not a single image shows the culprit or the mummy being carried from the building.

LASSITER and JULIET have stopped to face SOPHIE. Behind them is the display of a large skull of a T-Rex.

JULIET:
(looks through file) She's right. It's all right here.

SOPHIE hands the video to LASSITER, who passes it to JULIET.

SOPHIE:
The mummy disappeared in 15 seconds or less and our main feed picked up none of it. This all cracks of something larger than petty crime, and, not to sound too Shirley MacLaine, screams of something potentially supernatural. This requires someone with skills beyond the normal person. I want him. (points behind the detectives)

LASSITER turns around and sees the plaque next to the T-Rex skull. It is SHAWN. It reads "Discovered by Psychic Paleo-Sleuth SHAWN SPENCER".

LASSITER:
No, you don't.

SOPHIE:
Yes, I do.

JULIET:
(takes out phone) Do you think he's up?

EXT. MOTEL, NIGHT

SHAWN stands in the fenced pool area, a camera aimed at the parking lot. He takes a photo of a woman as she gets out of the passenger side of a car. His cell buzzes and he answers.

SHAWN:
Hello? Jules!

The woman is joined by a man, who looks around nervously before following the woman up the stairs.

SHAWN:
Actually I'm wide awake. Why do you ask? You want to watch a movie together over the phone? Please say it's Father of the Bride 2. How about Captain Ron?Pure Luck? You don't have anything with Martin Short?

SHAWN looks up as he hears the woman laugh. The couple pauses on the walkway for a quick kiss.

SHAWN:
Hold on a second.

SHAWN climbs the ladder to the pool slide for a better vantage point for his photographs. He takes a few of the couple entering a room.

SHAWN:
Well, you don't have to get snippy. You're the one that drunk-dialed me. Oh, really? I just assumed...I mean, it's 4:25, right? The museum? Are you kidding? They love me down there. You see my plaque?

INT. MUSEUM, DINOSAUR ROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN stands with JULIET next to his plaque.

SHAWN:
Uh-oh.

JULIET:
What's wrong?

SHAWN:
They only put one name on there.

JULIET:
So?

SHAWN:
So Gus is gonna have an aneurysm, and not the good kind.

LASSITER comes up between them and puts an arm around their shoulders.

LASSITER:
Spencer, we can rehash good times later. Right now I really need you to create some semblance of focus. (pulls SHAWN away and walks with him) Missing mummy. Missing guard. Old security system. Please tell our feisty little assistant curator that this was not some elaborate break-in so we can all go home.

SHAWN:
Okay, I'll try. (looks at a display) That a real beaver?

INT. MUSEUM, EGYPT ROOM, NIGHT

The case holding the empty sarcophagus is in the middle of the room. The glass lid is askew. Around the walls are displays containing other smaller artifacts. SOPHIE sees them arrive and walks over.

SHAWN:
Shawn Spencer. (holds out hand)

SOPHIE:
(shakes hand) I know. Sophie Morris Bridgewell.

SHAWN:
I know.

SOPHIE:
Everyone certainly loves you down here.

SHAWN:
And I love you. Metaphorically. (looks at JULIET) What? You had your shot. (walks into the room) Let me do what I do. (to CSI) Excuse me, I'll need some space. Thank you.

SHAWN slides his right foot forward, lowering himself towards the floor. He raises both hands to his head and looks over at SOPHIE, who seems impressed. SHAWN then falls forward, resting both arms on the dais, legs out behind him. With another look to SOPHIE, he starts doing push-ups. SOPHIE smiles and laughs, LASSITER rolls his eyes. SHAWN stands and looks at a display case against the wall.

SHAWN:
(points at random items) Have it. Have it. Want it. Have it. Mine's bigger. (walks around to the opposite side of the sarcophagus) I have a problem.

SOPHIE:
What is it?

SHAWN:
(continues around the display) The layout of this display is horrible. Who designed this? It's ridiculous. Really? We need two of these? Queen Nurfurtitty.

JULIET:
Nefertiti.

SHAWN:
I've heard it both ways.

SHAWN squats down beside the sarcophagus display and tilts his head. On the inside of the case lid is a hand print, like something tried to lift it from within. SHAWN stands and walks back to the others. On the polished floor, he notices footprints in the same dusty white as the hand.

SHAWN:
Huh.

LASSITER:
Well?

SHAWN:
I'm gonna have to concur with Detective Carlito Lassiteros on this one. That mummy was not stolen, Ms. Bridgewell.

LASSITER:
Great.

SHAWN:
I'm afraid it walked out all on its own.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER, SHAWN and JULIET enter the building and walk towards the bullpen.

LASSITER:
The mummy walked out? Come on, you're just trying to impress that pretty little assistant curator.

SHAWN:
Was she pretty? I hadn't noticed.

LASSITER:
Really? Brown eyes, languid smile, long slender neck of a Balanchine dancer.

JULIET:
I had three different hairstyles last week and you didn't comment on one.

SHAWN:
Look, I felt that something got up out of that coffin and walked away, not to the exit, but to the body of the museum.

VICK:
(walks up to them) Good, you're here. All of you in my office. (goes to her office)

SHAWN:
Sweet, now you got us in trouble.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

LASSITER, JULIET and SHAWN follow VICK into her office. She stands behind her desk and LASSITER sits in one of the chairs facing it.

VICK:
What I have to say is very... difficult.

SHAWN:
If this in any way pertains to Lassiter's third testicle, I'm afraid we already know.

VICK:
This is no time for jokes, Mr. Spencer. (sits and clears throat) When I accepted this position on an interim basis, the agreement between myself and the mayor was should things work out at an appropriate time, the interim would be removed from the title. As you know that has not yet happened. And recently I gave the mayor a deadline, a deadline that has passed without any sort of response. So effective Friday, I'm stepping down as chief.

JULIET:
What?

VICK:
I'm leaving.

JULIET:
You can't do that! Do they know?

VICK:
Oh, they know.

JULIET:
I'll write a letter. I'll start a petition. I'll leak it to the reporter at The Mirror.

VICK:
O'Hara, please. Thank you. I appreciate the sentiment, but the die is cast.

SHAWN:
Chief, are you sure you don't want to wait it out just a little bit longer? You never...

VICK:
No, Mr. Spencer.

LASSITER:
So you're saying the job is open.

JULIET smacks LASSITER on the back of the head. He looks up at her, questioning why.

LASSITER:
What? I mean, did anyone mention my name?

VICK:
I believe they have someone in mind.

LASSITER:
But you don't know if it's me?

SHAWN:
Look, Chief, let me just offer that I think you're a great chief. (sits in other chair) And, uh, I'm sure things will all work out.

VICK:
(trying to hold emotions) That's all for now.

SHAWN and LASSITER stand, hands in pockets, but don't move.

VICK:
Go!

The three slowly leave the room.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN is watching the security footage from the museum on the TV. GUS enters.

GUS:
What are you watching?

SHAWN:
Security videos from the museum.

GUS:
Videos? As in actual video tapes?

SHAWN:
Well, their system could use an overhaul.

GUS pulls his chair up beside SHAWN to watch the video but SHAWN stands and blocks the TV.

GUS:
Where are the tapes from the other cameras?

SHAWN:
That's it.

GUS:
One tape? (tries to look around SHAWN)

SHAWN:
(moves to block GUS) Yeah, it's on a rotation. It's actually not a bad system, you know? It appears you can't leave the museum without getting caught by the cameras.

GUS:
So it's sufficient?

SHAWN:
Maybe. (turns off TV) We should, probably check it out for ourselves, though. What say you?

GUS:
Sure.

SHAWN:
(heads for the door) There's one thing you should probably know before we get there.

INT. MUSEUM, DINOSAUR ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS look at the plaque for "Zippy". GUS is not pleased.

GUS:
"Paleo-sleuth Shawn Spencer"?

SHAWN:
(puts hands up) I know.

GUS:
I dug that thing up too.

SHAWN:
Gus, believe me, I was appalled myself at first. Sickened, really. But then I noticed, look! They didn't forget you completely.

GUS:
Where?

SHAWN:
There, right there! The "photo by" section.

GUS:
That says "photo by Bruton Gaster."

SHAWN:
Well I gave 'em the info when I was driving through a tunnel, so that probably played a role.

GUS:
I want a new plaque, Shawn. I want it tomorrow. I want my name in big yellow letters that blink, and why won't you even tell me what this museum case is about?

SHAWN:
In time. In time.

SOPHIE joins them.

SOPHIE:
Gentlemen, thank you for coming. (shakes SHAWN'S hand) Mr. Spencer, very good to see you again. (shakes GUS' hand) And you must be Mr. Gaster.

GUS:
Guster, Burton Guster. You people ever hear of spell checker?

SHAWN:
I was just giving Gaster here all the specifics.

SOPHIE:
Yes, well the exhibit just opened yesterday afternoon without a hitch. The alarm went off at 3:00 a.m.

SHAWN:
I was here at 5:00.

GUS:
A.M.? (scoffs) You were not.

SHAWN:
I was. I was working.

GUS:
Doing what?

SHAWN:
It was a private case. Look, I don't think we should bore Ms. Bridgewell here with the complexities of our other investigations.

GUS:
You're not tailing cheating boyfriends again, are you?

SHAWN:
(laughs)(whispers harshly) Gus, come on. I'm trying to look cool.

GUS:
I told you before, Shawn. We are bigger than that. We cleared, like, 50 bucks on the last one.

SHAWN:
Gus. Psychic-client privilege and what not? Huh? Come on. (to SOPHIE) Shall we continue?

SOPHIE:
Yes, this way. (walks away)

SHAWN:
(follows SOPHIE)(to GUS) What's wrong with you?

GUS:
You stole my picture!

INT. MUSEUM, EGYPT ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and SOPHIE proceed into the room as GUS hangs back, refusing to set foot inside.

SOPHIE:
So the bulk of the activity seems to have occurred in here.

SHAWN:
Yes, I can see it. The lid sliding off the being rising up, walking across the floor not unlike an Egyptian. Gus can show you. (turns and sees GUS outside the room) Gus?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
No what?

GUS:
You know I'm not walking into that room, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Come on, dude. I thought this was over in the sixth grade.

SOPHIE:
What's wrong?

SHAWN:
He won't break the plane of the mummy room.

SOPHIE:
Why not?

SHAWN:
He's afraid of being cursed.

SOPHIE:
He's not that far off base really.

SHAWN:
Please don't coddle him.

GUS:
Fact: every one of those guys that unearthed Tut's tomb, cursed. They're all dead now.

SHAWN:
Of course they are. That was over 80 years ago. Come on, man. This is gonna be good for you. Walk to me. Face your fears.

GUS:
You can talk all you want, but facts and logic will win out this time.

SHAWN:
Facts and logic are in the corner of the guy who thinks he's gonna get his face melted off?

GUS:
I'm not hearing it, Shawn.

SOPHIE:
Well you wanted to check the cameras, right?

SHAWN:
Will you set foot in the security camera room?

GUS pivots, motioning for SOPHIE and SHAWN to go ahead. SHAWN shakes his head in disbelief. SOPHIE merely smiles.

INT. MUSEUM, SECURITY ROOM, DAY

GUS sits at the desk as he and SHAWN watch the monitors for the security cameras.

SHAWN:
This system's actually better than I thought. Even if you make it out of one room, you get picked up in the next room immediately.

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
I'm gonna try and beat the system. Watch me, just on the center screen. See if I can get out.

GUS:
All I gotta do is sit here? Fine.

SHAWN:
(pulls phone from pocket) Yeah, we'll communicate on the phone, so give me a call. (heads for door)

GUS:
(spins around) No, you call me. This is my work cell. I'm not paying for that call.

SHAWN:
Gus, it's usage minutes. It doesn't matter which one of us makes the call.

GUS:
Just call me, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Fine. (leaves)

GUS spins back around to face the monitors and pulls out his phone.

SHAWN:
(returns) I'm sorry, I can't let this go. It's a monthly plan. It's a minutes plan.

GUS:
Can we get started with this thing now?

SHAWN stammers and leaves.

INT. MUSEUM, DINOSAUR ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is on his phone as he walks through the crowded room. He then makes a dash out the way he came.

INT. MUSEUM, SECURITY ROOM, DAY

GUS watches the monitor as SHAWN runs through one of the exhibits.

GUS:
I saw that. Got it on two angles.

SHAWN runs through the dinosaur room past Zippy.

GUS:
Do you want to give this up any time soon?

SHAWN crawls on all fours across the floor of another room.

GUS:
You're crawling.

Back in the dinosaur room, SHAWN hides behind a plant, pushing it in front of him.

GUS:
I see you, Shawn. You're behind the plant.

SHAWN peers out from the top of the plant.

GUS:
See you there. See you there.

SHAWN pushes the plant across the room.

GUS:
The plant is moving across the room, Shawn.

SHAWN then walks closely behind a very nervous woman.

GUS:
Leave that poor lady alone, Shawn.

SHAWN next uses a square of carpet held over her head as he slowly walks across the floor.

GUS:
You're using the carpet? Really? Wait a minute. I almost bought that for a second.

SHAWN then uses a wolf pelt as he runs across the floor of the dinosaur room.

GUS:
You're using the wolf pelt? This is like watching Entrapment if instead of Catherine Zeta-Jones they had some guy with pancake butt.

SHAWN:
(into phone) I do not have pancake butt!

One of the patrons stares at SHAWN as he walks past after this announcement.*

INT. MUSEUM, EGYPT ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is hiding behind the black marble slab near the sarcophagus, still on the phone with GUS. He doesn't see SOPHIE enter.

SHAWN:
What you got? You got something?

GUS:
(over phone) Yep.

SHAWN:
Really?

GUS:
(over phone) Yep.

SHAWN:
You can see me right now?

GUS:
(over phone) Horrid, Shawny boy. Horrid. Horrid.

SHAWN stands and SOPHIE sees him.

INT. MUSEUM, SECURITY ROOM, DAY

GUS watches as SOPHIE greets SHAWN.

SOPHIE:
Hi! Hello!

GUS:
Great, now I gotta watch this?

INT. MUSEUM, EGYPT ROOM, DAY

Looking at the camera, SHAWN presses a button on his phone.

INT. MUSEUM, SECURITY ROOM, DAY

GUS:
You're muting me for the first interesting thing that's happened? (mocks SHAWN) "Look at me, look at me. I love my hair. I can make obscure '80s references that nobody understands. Laugh at me. Hey, know something about me? I have a motorcycle, but I never seem to be riding it."

SHAWN and SOPHIE leave the room together.

INT. MUSEUM, AMERICANA ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is attempting to hide behind a cut-out cactus.

SHAWN:
How about this? Are you seeing this?

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. MUSEUM, SECURITY ROOM, DAY

GUS:
Yep.

SHAWN:
(moves head a fraction) How about now? You see this?

GUS:
Terrible.

SHAWN:
(by cactus, bucket over his head, phone held up to the bucket) How about this? You seeing this?

GUS:
If you're gonna hide under a barrel, don't put the phone next to your ear.

SHAWN:
(walks sideways, back pressed against a wall) You're getting all of this? You can see all of this?

GUS:
Yep. Whoa, I lost you.

SHAWN reappears on the monitor.

GUS:
There you are.

SHAWN:
(over phone) Ha! I got you.

GUS:
For one second, Shawn.

With a sly grin, SHAWN runs to a corner of the room.

GUS:
Trying that corner again? Please. (chuckles)(phone beeps) Shawn? Eh...great. Now you wore down my battery. (watches monitor) Where are you?

SHAWN leans over next to GUS.

SHAWN:
How about now?

GUS starts and looks at SHAWN. SHAWN closes his phone and looks at the monitor.

SHAWN:
Bingo.

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

LASSITER closes the door and looks over at a MAN sitting at the table.

LASSITER:
I'm sure you can understand, Mr. Wyles, why I've been so motivated by what I've uncovered in this investigation. (sits across from WYLES)

WYLES:
Well, all I know, detective, is I certainly seem to see your name in the paper every day.

LASSITER:
Really? Which paper would that be, because you know I've missed some of the coverage.

WYLES:
Can we just get on with what you want?

LASSITER:
Of course. (opens file) It's really just more of a formality than anything. I wasn't even going to call you in today. I just need to go over a few bank records and see some papers and exhume your father's body.

WYLES:
I'm sorry. What was that last one?

LASSITER:
Oh, uh, it's just more of a technical detail than anything exhuming your father's body. I mean, you wouldn't even have to be there. I could have him back in eternal slumber by noon. 1:45 at the latest.

INT. MUSEUM, DINOSAUR ROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS walk through the exhibit. There's no one else there.

GUS:
This place is gonna close soon.

SHAWN:
No, it's not.

GUS:
Shawn, I was in there forever. Somebody's shutting off the lights with us in here.

SHAWN:
Pretty sure that's a timer.

INT. MUSEUM, LOBBY, NIGHT

GUS and SHAWN walk towards to doors.

GUS:
Why would they set a timer with people still in here?

SHAWN:
'Cause the museum closed 20 minutes ago?

GUS:
(pulls on the locked doors and panics) How did they close it with us inside? (crosses the lobby to try different doors)

SHAWN:
(follows GUS) Well, remember I said I talked to Sophie the curator? She's very sweet, by the way. She loves Red Robin. Isn't that a strange favorite restaurant?

GUS climbs behind the hanging backdrop.

SHAWN:
You're going behind the tarp? Really? There's an exit behind the tarp? You're probably gonna be eaten by carpet beetles.

SHAWN walks down the hall as GUS fights his way behind the tarp.

SHAWN:
Look, I discovered a number of intriguing things when I was figuring out how to crack...

GUS:
Ow!

SHAWN:
...the security cameras, including an exhibit that looked like it had already been broken into, so what I'm thinking is whoever did it might come back because anyone on the inside knows that there's no night guard on duty and...

GUS emerges from the other end of the tarp.

GUS:
And what?

SHAWN:
Sophie said it was cool.

GUS:
What was cool?

SHAWN:
Come on, man. Haven't you ever wanted to spend a night in the museum? You know, do it up with all the stuffed creatures and the bones?

GUS:
No, Shawn, I haven't. I can't spend the night in the museum. I don't have my tooth brush. I don't have any of my multivitamins. And oh, yeah, I don't want my soul suffering eternal damnation for disrupting the sleep of an Egyptian canal digger. (walks off)

SHAWN:
Come on, dude! With Hastings on the lam, they're fresh out of night watchmen. Sophie was actually quite happy that I offered. She's taking me to dinner. What do they have at Red Robin?

INT. MUSEUM, HALL, NIGHT

GUS spots an emergency door and pushes against it as SHAWN talks.

SHAWN:
Come on, Gus. They didn't get what they were looking for the first time. Maybe they'll break in again. We'll be here to catch 'em red-handed. Won't that be cool? Dude, there's probably a sensor of some sort. Take a step back.

GUS steps back from the door and waves his hands in front of the door to check for a motion sensor.

SHAWN:
Okay, now try it.

GUS pushes against the door with a grunt as SHAWN smiles. GUS steps back and SHAWN notices something outside.

SHAWN:
What's on the hill?

In the rolling evening mist, something metallic can be seen.

GUS:
That's freedom, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Does that look like a camera?

GUS:
No. No one's gonna leave their camera outside in the mist so it can get ruined.

SHAWN:
Looks like a camera to me.



SHAWN:
Hello.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, NIGHT

JULIET:
We caught a break.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) We caught a break.

JULIET:
Hastings, that security guard from the museum who's still missing, had a few assault charges on his record that never went to trial.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) Ooh! Hastings is way more violent than we thought.

JULIET:
And we found the car finally.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) They found his car.

GUS leans in to listen to JULIET'S side of the conversation.

JULIET:
Yeah, it was in the shop actually.

SHAWN:
But you didn't find him?

GUS grabs the phone and puts it on speaker.

JULIET:
No, the shop gave him a loaner. I just thought I would let you know, give you a heads up, see if you come up with anything.

SHAWN:
What kind of car is the loaner?

JULIET:
Gray GMC pickup.

SHAWN and GUS look out the door to see two vehicles in the lot: the Echo and a gray pickup right next to it. They drop the phone and the pieces scatter.

SHAWN:
Don't be mad.

GUS:
Why would I be mad? I'm locked in a museum with possibly a violent criminal and probably an angry mummy spirit. And here's a bonus: we have no phones.

SHAWN:
I told you to charge that phone.

GUS:
You did not.

SHAWN:
I didn't? Does thinking it count?

GUS storms off.

SHAWN:
They might have a snack bar. (follows GUS)

INT. MUSEUM, NIGHT

GUS and SHAWN walk through the exhibits.

SHAWN:
You know, maybe that truck wasn't gray, dude. Maybe it was, like, a deep midnight blue or a black or a nice kelly green. It's hard to know for sure. You know, the cones in the eyes make it possible to see at night...

GUS:
I know how the eyes work, Shawn. I just hope I still have mine in the morning.

SHAWN:
(looks around) Where exactly are we?

GUS:
He's here. He's gonna come back. He's gonna kill us.

SHAWN:
Dude, I never said Hastings stole the thing.

GUS:
No, you think the actual mummy walked out. That makes me feel better.

SHAWN:
Don't go all "glass half empty" on me. Let me show you what I found.

INT. MUSEUM, 1800s EXHIBIT, NIGHT

SHAWN leads GUS across the room as the camera follows them. Above a display case of antique guns is a framed Confederate flag.

SHAWN:
What is wrong with this flag?

GUS:
Everything.

SHAWN:
Besides that.

GUS:
I don't know.

SHAWN:
It's upside-down.

GUS:
And backwards. What's your point?

SHAWN:
(runs finger along the bottom of the frame) It's dust gathered on the bottom of the frame. That means somebody either turned it upside-down or knocked it over.

SHAWN notices that the angle of the camera has changed; one section is free of dust. He then remembers when GUS couldn't spot him on the monitor.

SHAWN:
And this little nook is not in camera range.

GUS:
It's not a nook.

SHAWN:
What would you call it? It's clearly not a corner. Cranny? Will you sign off on cranny?

GUS:
Why am I here, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Because somebody didn't want the camera to see what ever happened in this cranny.

GUS:
I never signed off on cranny.

SHAWN:
There's nothing here, Gus. It's just a bunch of old guns. (notices ivory grip of one is cracked) And not even nice ones at that.

GUS:
The Lexan glass case that houses it is worth more.

SHAWN:
Lexan glass?

GUS:
Yeah, it's bulletproof.

SHAWN:
Well, it would have to be in case the guns decided to fire themselves. Lexan glass. (walks away)

GUS:
(follows) What? That's common knowledge, Shawn. People know that.

SHAWN:
Who, people in Charlton Heston's house?

GUS:
Yes. And your mama.

INT. MUSEUM, MID-CENTURY EXHIBIT, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are looking at a female mannequin in period dress.

GUS:
Did you hear that?

SHAWN:
Nobody's here but us.

GUS:
I tried, Shawn. I can't do this.

SHAWN:
Gus, don't be a Traveling Wilbury. (sees car) Look, Christine's here.

GUS:
Will you stop it, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Relax, it's not even the right color. (continues on and spies old fashioned fridge)Dude, we have got to get one of these for the office. How much you think these things run?

GUS:
I don't know.

SHAWN:
How heavy are they?

The refrigerator starts whirring and SHAWN is startled. He smiles and laughs.

SHAWN:
That was actually kind of scary, Gus. (turns around and sees he is alone) Come on, dude! It's just the motor on the fridge! Of course, why would an exhibit be plugged in?

GUS returns as SHAWN knocks on the door of the fridge.

GUS:
The sign says "Do Not Touch", Shawn.

SHAWN:
(pulls sign off) Not anymore. (tries to open it) It's stuck, though.

GUS:
It's supposed to be stuck. To keep people like you out.

SHAWN:
People who what? People who spend the night in museums to investigate mummies that may have walked out on their own?

With a grunt, SHAWN gets the fridge open and a body falls out.

GUS:
(jumps back) Whoa!

They look at the body and see it is the missing Hastings.

EXT. MUSEUM, DAY

A security guard approaches the door by the loading dock, getting his key out to unlock the door. The second he does, GUS pushes it open, knocking the guard down and runs for the car. As the guard stands, we hear the car engine start and the tires screech as GUS drives away.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

GUS is researching wolfsbane on the computer when SHAWN enters the office.

SHAWN:
(sighs) You are here. What are you doing? (walks over to stand beside GUS)

GUS:
Bidding for talismans.

SHAWN:
Talismen.

GUS:
I don't care what they're called, Shawn. (pushes SHAWN out of the way and walks to his computer) I'm acquiring protection for the spiritual injustice we caused in the museum.

SHAWN:
You can buy wolfsbane online?

GUS:
In bulk. Now I just gotta find somebody to loan me a cat. You got McNabb's number?

SHAWN:
Come on, Gus. I thought that, at the very least, finding the guard dead would help you jump on the band wagon that, hey, this is a real flesh and blood killer. (goes over to GUS)

GUS:
He was killed by the mummy, Shawn. (goes back to his desk)

SHAWN:
You don't know that. You have no proof. Okay, fine, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you I signed us up for night guard duty. And I'm sorry I didn't tell you there was a mummy involved. But we have a legitimate trail now. The cops are taking this seriously. I need you! I need the sweet blue shirt, I need the pants, I need the winsome smile that hides the sad Jamaican clown inside. We need to call Lassiter and we are not going back to the museum. No more mummy room, no more spooky stuff. I promise.

EXT. CEMETARY, DAY

LASSITER directs as the coffin is raised from the ground. WYLES is there with his lawyer.

LASSITER:
Let's go. Bring it up.

GUS and SHAWN arrive.

GUS:
He's exhuming a body?

WYLES:
(to lawyer) He is casually disturbing what should be the passing of a great and dignified man.

SHAWN:
Yeah, he does that. (watches WYLES as he walks past) Oh! White socks, black shoes. What's the rule on that? Don't you have to be wearing jeans? What's the rule? Come on dude. I honestly had no idea he was gonna be pulling a corpse from the ground.

GUS:
Don't worry about it, Shawn. I honestly didn't know I was gonna be putting my foot in your ass. Life's full of surprises.

JULIET arrives.

JULIET:
I got the coroner's report on the guard Hastings. (walks past SHAWN and GUS to LASSITER)

SHAWN:
(to GUS) At least stay for this, see how silly it is to be afraid of mummies. What do you got, Jules?

JULIET:
You're not gonna like it.

GUS:
We're not gonna like it.

SHAWN:
I'm sure we'll be able to make something of it.

JULIET:
Hastings was strangled to death.

SHAWN:
Ha! No magic involved there. And correct me if I'm wrong Jules, but you can actually get fingerprints off strangulation victims.

JULIET:
I'm afraid that's not possible.

SHAWN:
Why is that?

JULIET:
The hand was wrapped in some sort of cloth.

GUS:
Cloth?

JULIET:
There were linen fibers embedded into the guard's neck.

SHAWN:
(chuckles) Clearly that was just to cover his prints.

JULIET:
We also found dust and spores that weren't from this area.

SHAWN:
Well, maybe the cleaning crew didn't come around.

JULIET:
Only if they didn't come around for over 3,000 years. The spores came from inside the coffin.

SHAWN:
Thanks, Jules.

JULIET walks away.

INT. HENRY'S, KITCHEN, DAY

HENRY is on a step-stool wiping the glass doors of his cabinets when SHAWN and GUS enter.

HENRY:
Finally!

SHAWN:
Finally what?

HENRY:
I've been leaving messages on your phone.

SHAWN:
Yeah, I sort of dropped my phone.

GUS picks up a package of cupcakes sitting on the table.

HENRY:
Yeah? What'd I tell you about taking care of your stuff? (walks over, takes the cupcakes from GUS and puts them in the fridge)

SHAWN:
You know what? You're right. First my tricycle out in the yard, now this. I see a pattern developing here.

GUS picks up a box of pastries and HENRY pulls it from his hands to put away.

HENRY:
All right, look, Shawn, I was hoping we could talk alone. No offense, Gus.

GUS:
Hey... (puts hands up and heads for door)

SHAWN:
Oh, no no. Don't you dare. We are here to talk to you and this is urgent.

HENRY:
(picks up cleaner and rag) So is mine.

SHAWN:
Ours involves a dead guy.

HENRY:
(stammers) Why do you always have to win, Shawn?

SHAWN:
'Cause we're winners.

HENRY:
Fine, what is it? Go ahead. (sets tote on table and starts cleaning the counter)

SHAWN:
Okay, what do you do when your best suspect, uh, sort of just...

GUS:
Say it, Shawn.

SHAWN:
...doesn't exist anymore?

HENRY:
People disappear all the time, Shawn. Some are very good at it. Especially a career criminal.

SHAWN:
Yeah, this is a little more complicated.

HENRY:
Look, it doesn't matter who you're talking about here, Shawn. But when the trail goes cold, you do what every good cop does. You follow the time line. You trace back the steps that led to the trail going cold.

SHAWN:
A background check.

HENRY:
Exactly.

SHAWN:
Perfect. Perfect, Dad!

SHAWN and GUS turn to leave but stop when HENRY speaks.

HENRY:
But I want to see you later, without Gus. I need to talk to you.

SHAWN:
Okay, what is this? What is all this "without Gus" stuff? I mean, it's Gus. Just say it. Say what it is. What is it?

HENRY:
Okay. All right. I got a phone call a couple of days ago and, uh, I don't know if you have any plans, but, um... (walks up to SHAWN and leans in close) Are you busy on Saturday?

SHAWN:
(leans away from HENRY) You... You want me to come with you to Awkward Class?

HENRY:
(stammers) Forget it! (walks off)

SHAWN:
See ya!

SHAWN and GUS leave.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK, JULIET and LASSITER are sitting at the table in the corner. JULIET is holding a notepad and has a variety of party decorations in front of her.

VICK:
Detectives, that's very thoughtful of you, but I just don't want you to make a big fuss.

JULIET:
We are not going to make a fuss. Detective Lassiter and I just want to throw you a going away party, and it's going to be very simple.

A TV is on in the station and the report catches LASSITER'S attention.

REPORTER:
...the case of William Wyles III.

LASSITER leans back in his chair so he can see the TV through the blinds and around the officer blocking his view.

REPORTER:
It was formerly believed that Wyles' death was due to an accidental fall down the stairs of his Montecito home.

LASSITER pushes his wheeled chair towards the door.

REPORTER:
But now a former employee has come forward to say she heard loud arguing coming from the Wyles's study the night of his death, contrary to the belief that Wyles was alone the night he died. Santa Barbara Police Detective Carlton Lassiter, who's been leading this investigation, was unavailable for comment.

LASSITER:
"Unavailable for comment"? I've been here all day. Who's not giving me my messages? (looks back to see VICK and JULIET staring at him) Uh, cupcakes. (pulls himself back to the table) Right, of course. With little cuffs on them, and, um, sprinkles. We're really gonna miss you.

LASSITER turns his head towards the TV as the report continues.

REPORTER:
Wyles, who became a publishing magnate at the age of 30, was one of Santa Barbara's leading philanthropists and a major contributor to political campaigns, as well as a well-known collector of war memorabilia. At his height, he owned more than 30 publications...

INT. PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN has the TV on with the same report. He is sitting in a chair, twirling a pen in his hands. GUS is on his computer.

SHAWN:
How's the background check coming?

GUS:
Just finished. Rahmentottem lived during the 19th dynasty of Egypt, probably near Giza. He had 11 sons, all of whom spent their days smelting metal from the ore along the banks of the Nile.

SHAWN:
Smelters, huh? Perhaps you misunderstood. (stands) We don't care what he did when he was living. (moves to clear board) Only since he's been a mummy. Let's do this. (starts to write) First, he was on display for six months in Cincinnati. (draws a little stick figure next to "Cincy") He didn't kill anybody there. Then he was on loan, Plano, Texas. Nobody had their eyes or internal organs stolen there. (draws a steaming bowl next to Plano)

GUS:
What's that?

SHAWN:
It's a bowl of chili.

GUS:
And who's that up there?

SHAWN:
It's Austin Kerns. Would you pay attention? Then he was transported for two days by truck, spent the evening in the museum warehouse, and boom! Was on display first thing the next morning.

GUS:
Mine's better.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but mine's something sensible that people might utilize.

GUS:
So you're the sensible one now? (stands and walks over to SHAWN)

SHAWN:
More and more lately.

GUS:
Okay. All right. Let's work backwards.

SHAWN:
We just did. (circles "warehouse")

EXT. WAREHOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk over to the museum's loading dock.

GUS:
This is as close as I get to that museum.

SHAWN:
I know. Quick, put that on. (points to elaborate Chinese dragon head)

A man in a wheelchair comes down a ramp to confront SHAWN and GUS. He is wearing coveralls bearing the name KEN.

SHAWN:
My name is Shawn Spencer. I'm working with Sophie and the museum. This is my partner Patty Simcox. We're wondering if there's any documentation on the arrival of the Rock'em Sock'em mummy.

GUS:
Rahmentottem. Or has there been any instances of things exploding for no apparent reason?

KEN:
I don't know nothing. And I don't think you guys should be in here.

GUS:
Right. (turns to leave)

SHAWN:
(stops GUS) Perhaps I'll call Sophie and let her know you're not being very helpful.

KEN:
Listen, all I have security access for is this room.

SHAWN:
Well, then let us know what happens here, man! Here at the docks!

KEN:
Fine, it's simple. That thing shows up, a museum rep comes and does an inspection. And then we put it out on the floor. I wish that there was more that I could tell you.

SHAWN looks around and sees the tripod still on the hill.

SHAWN:
(taps GUS on the arm) Dude, it's a tripod. I told you that was a tripod. (runs to the hill) With a camera. Coming back.

GUS follows SHAWN and they see a figure in a hoodie holding a camera, making its way to the tripod.

SHAWN:
Hey, wait up!

The figure runs.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

They make to run up the hill but jump back due to brambles. They then run along the drive.

EXT. PARKING LOT, DAY

SHAWN and GUS chase the figure to a car. It stops at the trunk and then tries the front door, but it's locked.

SHAWN:
What are you doing? (holds up keys) Left your keys in the trunk lock.

STUDENT:
I'm sorry. I know I promised not to shoot there. I know you guys said you'd call the cops, but I just need one more night for my project to be done.

GUS:
Your project?

STUDENT:
My film project. Aren't you guys with the...

SHAWN:
Yes, we are.

STUDENT:
With who?

SHAWN:
Whoever you think we're with.

STUDENT:
The museum?

SHAWN:
Yes, exactly. And you are a film student?

STUDENT:
Yes, working on Night Cycle. It's my thesis project. It's just the life cycle of a wild flower at the top of the hill.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. The name of your film is Night Cycle?

GUS:
What's wrong with that?

SHAWN:
Well, it's kind of boring. Unless it's about a motorcycle that comes to life at night and solves crime and does sweet wheelies.

STUDENT:
Listen, I already told the guy in the jumpsuit. I mean, you could barely see the museum in the background. I just needed to frame it up that way.

SHAWN:
You have footage of the museum?

STUDENT:
Yeah, but it won't infringe on anyone's copyright, I can guarantee it.

SHAWN:
Do you have stuff from Tuesday night?

STUDENT:
Yeah, but not on me.

INT. EDITING LAB, DAY

The STUDENT pulls up footage on the computer. The hat comes off to reveal long blonde hair. SHAWN and GUS exchange looks. GUS leans forward to sniff the STUDENT behind her back. SHAWN smacks him.

STUDENT:
Here it is. A standard video camera runs at 30 frames per second.

GUS:
Yeah, we know that.

SHAWN:
How would we know that?

GUS:
It's common knowledge, Shawn. And technically it's 29.97, unless you're working in HD, then it's 23.98 partially segmented frames.

STUDENT:
Regardless, for time lapse I set it for one frames for minute. So everything moves faster.

SHAWN:
30 times faster.

GUS:
1,800 times faster.

SHAWN:
I knew that. I was testing you.

GUS:
Sure you did.

STUDENT:
Okay, guys, what are we looking for here, exactly?

SHAWN:
It's pretty simple. A crime occurred at the museum on this particular evening. We just wanna know if your camera caught any footage of it. It's nothing too crazy.

GUS:
And most likely there's a crazed mummy out and about strangling people willy-nilly.

SHAWN:
Yes. And that.

STUDENT:
This is 3:00 am.

The wildflower is the focus of the film but in the background can be seen a van and door to the warehouse.

GUS:
(leans forward) Slow it down here.

SHAWN gets up from his chair and moves to sit next to the STUDENT at the table.

STUDENT:
This is kind of exciting.

The three watch the screen closely and a figure appears on screen looking suspiciously like a mummy.

SHAWN:
Holy crap. Gus, can you believe it? Gus?

GUS is gone, his chair still spinning.

SHAWN:
(to STUDENT) He's a little scared of mummies. Dude, it's just a film!

STUDENT:
Video.

SHAWN:
Even better. No one can reach through the screen and grab you. That's so weird. We only saw him for one frame and then, you know, he walked out and poof, he's gone.

GUS slowly returns to the room. SHAWN then sees a light on the van.

SHAWN:
Wait. Look at the lights on the van. (stands)

The van disappears from the screen.

SHAWN:
Dude, he took that van.

STUDENT:
The mummy?

GUS:
(sits) Great, now we got a mummy on the loose and the son of a bitch knows how to drive a stick?

SHAWN:
Now we know how he got away.

GUS:
We need to call the police.

SHAWN:
No, not yet. I've seen that van.

GUS:
You know where it is?

SHAWN:
Unless it's moved in the last two hours, I do.

SHAWN and GUS hurry from the room.

EXT. WAREHOUSE, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS pull up in front of the loading dock. A white van is parked there.

GUS:
What the...

SHAWN:
Dude, I told you it was here.

GUS parks the car and they both get out. SHAWN heads for the van.

SHAWN:
Whoa!

The van pulls away with screeching tires. They run back to the car.

SHAWN:
I told you I saw it!

As SHAWN turns getting into the car, he sees KEN in the open doorway. GUS puts the car into gear and keeps making stop-and-go turns.

SHAWN:
What are you doing?

GUS:
Turning the car around, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Dude, he's not even gonna be in California by the time we get out of here. Just keep turning the wheel!

GUS:
I don't wanna hit anything, Shawn!

SHAWN:
I know, but it's not...

GUS:
This is a company car.

SHAWN:
Dude, you got it. You clearly had it after the second... Really? The 11-point turn, dude?

The car is finally facing the right direction and GUS drives after the van.

EXT. ROAD, NIGHT

The Echo follows the van down the wet road, a mist in the air.

INT. ECHO, NIGHT

GUS:
This is a prime example of a situation best handled by the police, or a witch doctor.

SHAWN:
It's not a mummy, Gus.

GUS:
You keep saying that, and it keeps coming up mummy.

They watch the van as it approaches a dirt side road.

SHAWN:
No way he makes that turn.

The van makes the turn.

SHAWN:
Whoa! Slow down.

GUS makes the turn slowly.

EXT.  DIRT ROAD, NIGHT

The van goes over a couple of bumps before crashing into a tree.

INT. ECHO, NIGHT

GUS:
He hit a tree.

SHAWN:
Let's go get him. (unclips seatbelt and reaches for door)

GUS:
I'm not getting out there.

SHAWN:
Dude, they hit a tree. Whoever they are, they're not moving. They're incapacitated. They could be hurt, maybe even dead.

GUS:
Maybe undead.

SHAWN:
They might need our help. (opens door and gets out)

GUS:
Or our internal organs! Let's call the police.

SHAWN:
With whose phone?

GUS:
All right, fine. I'm bringing my bat.

SHAWN:
Grab some flashlights.

EXT. DIRT ROAD, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS walk slowly towards the van. SHAWN holds a flashlight in front of him. GUS has a flashlight in one hand and a raised baseball bat in the other. An owl hoots and they spin around nervously, checking to see if anything is behind them. They approach the driver's side of the van.

GUS:
Shawn, I think... I think this may be the most terrifying moment of my life.

SHAWN:
You're confronting it head on. I'm so proud of you, buddy. Shh.

SHAWN points as something moves in the woods ahead of them.

SHAWN:
I think I just saw someone running away in the woods. (sees the door) Look! That door's cracked! I don't think anybody's here.

GUS:
How sure are you?

SHAWN:
Fairly to pretty damn.

GUS:
Good, because I don't think I can take one more... (turns and shines light into van to reveal mummy in driver's seat) Shawn?

SHAWN is running to the car.

INT. SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are walking alongside LASSITER.

SHAWN:
I am telling you, Carlytown, you gotta come with us on this!

LASSITER:
And I'm telling you, I'm about to solve the biggest case of my career. So which do you think I'd rather do?

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, NIGHT

LASSITER picks up the phone on his desk and dials.

LASSITER:
The old man didn't die from a fall down the stairs. Initial findings indicate he had blunt force trauma to his head before he fell. So unless you've got a psychic answer for that, you guys can run along. Ah, crud. Now Wyles isn't answering his phone. (hangs up)

JULIET:
I have the final coroner's report on that exhumed body. It was definitely a head trauma. And it turns out that unidentified matter found in his skull was a chip of ivory. (hands LASSITER file)

LASSITER:
Great. (walks away)

INT. SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN:
But I have the best reveal ever.

LASSITER:
Spencer, we'll get to your little mummy thing later. Quite honestly, I only took the case because Wyles IV is on the board of trustees. I thought I could do a little snooping, but all I got was dead ends.

SHAWN:
I can solve both cases!

VICK:
(sticks head out of office door) You can what?

SHAWN:
Lassie, call Wyles on his cell phone. He'll pick that up because he's not at home. (to GUS) Dude, we got it.

SHAWN and GUS start jumping up and down. VICK walks over to them.

GUS:
Oh, we are good!

SHAWN:
(stops jumping) Then meet us at the museum.

GUS:
(stops jumping) Why can't they just meet us at a well-lit Starbucks?

SHAWN:
One more time, buddy. For justice.

SHAWN leaves and GUS follows.

INT. MUSEUM, EGYPT ROOM, NIGHT

LASSITER walks in with WYLES. JULIET, VICK and SOPHIE follow. GUS waits out the room's edge.

WYLES:
Why am I here?

LASSITER:
You'll find out soon enough. But whatever it is, I'm taking full credit for it.

VICK:
Just cooperate with us, Mr. Wyles. Things don't look very good for you right now.

WYLES:
Yeah, well, I'll have your job.

VICK:
Well, it's too late for that. Someone else already does.

SHAWN rises from the sarcophagus in stereotypical mummy fashion, a groan escaping his lips.

SOPHIE:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Don't worry, Sophie. I'm being very gentle. I laid down a blanket and everything. Not my first time alone in a coffin. By the way, playing dead? Awesome.

WYLES:
What is this nonsense?

VICK:
He's solving a case.

[We see the flashbacks as SHAWN describes what happened]

SHAWN:
(stands) Actually, I'm solving two cases. But let's take them one at a time. First, a being did rise from this coffin and walk out of the museum on Tuesday night. Strangled poor Hastings, may he rest in peace, with his bare hands. Correction, linen-wrapped hands.

GUS:
Thank you. I was the first one to say that it was a mummy.

SHAWN:
But that being was not the mummy Rub-my-bottom.

GUS:
Rahmentottem.

SHAWN:
That mummy never made it into the museum. No, that mummy never made it out of the white van in the parking lot. It was swapped out by an angry warehouse foreman on wheels. It was all part of an elaborate break-in.

WYLES:
This is absolute insanity.

SHAWN:
An interesting choice of words. I thought for sure you'd say "genius".

WYLES:
Well, why would I say "genius"?

SHAWN:
Because it was your plan.

WYLES:
My plan?

SHAWN:
You're the one that got into the Snuffalupagus wrapped in just enough tea-stained linen to look like a mummy through the cracked lid. You needed to get those pistols back, didn't you? Yeah, the ones that used to be at the top of the stairs in your father's house. Especially that one with the chipped ivory handle. Which...

LASSITER:
Which was the murder weapon!

SHAWN:
Come on, Lass. A little consideration, please? I mean, look. I'm going all out with the coffin thing here. I'm doing my thing.

WYLES:
Detectives...

LASSITER:
You knocked your father on the head with that pistol, let him fall to his death, and then ran out and waited for somebody else to find him.

JULIET:
And the pistol got willed to the museum.

SOPHIE:
That's why you worked so hard to get that exhibit closed, and delayed the installation of the new security system.

SHAWN:
Well, he couldn't get his way into the display. But he needed to be in the museum.

LASSITER:
You have been a busy little boy, haven't you?

VICK:
I believe you will be my final Santa Barbara arrest, Mr. Wyles.

LASSITER:
Put your hands behind your back, sir. (cuffs WYLES)

SHAWN:
Nice, nice... but guys, check it out. There's more, right?

Everyone starts to walk from the room.

SHAWN:
He tilted the camera so that he wouldn't be visible. He... he strangled Hastings so there wouldn't be a witness! I saw him run away in the forest!

GUS follows the others. The lights go out.

SHAWN:
Gus?

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

There are gift baskets on the table plus a wrapped pineapple.

JULIET:
Is there any chance at all you'll stay?

VICK:
No. But I'm sure we'll see each other around. Look, I knew the mayor wanted Raymond Sauter for the job. He's an old friend of his, but you know, Sauter didn't become available until recently. So I did what I had to do. Look, I'm sure Sauter will do a fine job. (packs items into boxes on her desk)

SHAWN:
Are you sure you'll have a use for this? (holds up glass fish)

VICK makes a face at him and nods so he'll put it back. He doesn't.

GUS:
Dude, you're being kind of insensitive.

SHAWN:
She'll be fine.

A female DETECTIVE comes to the open door.

DETECTIVE:
Phone. It's the mayor.

VICK:
(picks up phone) Yes, sir? Well, yes... Of course. Yes, that's... Sir, you don't have to beg. Oh, you are begging? As of now? Okay. (hangs up) I'm the new chief.

JULIET gasps.

GUS:
Not interim?

VICK:
Don't you dare call me that again.

JULIET and GUS cheer and hug VICK. SHAWN puts the fish back on the desk, a small smile on his face.

JULIET:
Oh, my God, what happened? What did he say?

LASSITER enters with a newspaper.

VICK:
I honestly have no idea.

LASSITER:
I think I do. (shows VICK the paper)

VICK:
What's this?

The front page headline reads "Sauter Stung in Adultery Revelation". The picture shows the couple SHAWN was following at the motel.

LASSITER:
Bumped my arrest to page two. Congratulations, Karen. (shakes VICK'S hand)

VICK:
Thank you.

SHAWN looks at the paper and whistles. The photo is credited to "Bruton Gaster". VICK looks at SHAWN but says nothing. The others are too excited to notice.

JULIET:
We should have a party!

GUS:
We should definitely have a party.

JULIET:
We have all the party accoutrements!

VICK:
Just go get some party gear...

JULIET:
(claps and jumps up and down) Okay!

VICK:
...and just open some crackers and a bottle of something.

INT. HENRY'S, KITCHEN, DAY

HENRY places a bowl of fruit on the kitchen table that now has a cloth and candles.

HENRY:
Shawn, are you sure you didn't get some sort of special message this week?

SHAWN:
Dad, I told you, I dropped my phone. Now, I gotta go. (turns to leave)

HENRY:
No, no! Shawn! Look, there's something I gotta get off my chest before you leave here!

SHAWN:
(turns and walks back) Dad, I don't know if you just read The Secret or watched an emotional Oprah or what, but I don't think we're ready to open our souls to each other.

HENRY:
Well, we have no choice, kid.

SHAWN:
But we do, and it's good. Because what we have is simple and shallow and unobtrusive. So let's have this conversation when you're 90 and maybe on an oxygen tank. 'Cause I have a date with a woman who runs a museum, and that's new for me.

The doorbell rings and SHAWN heads for the door.

HENRY:
No, Shawn! Please, no!

SHAWN:
It just feels good. You know what, I'll grab the door for you on my way out!

HENRY leans against the doorway as SHAWN opens the door.

SHAWN:
Mom.

Episode 2x8 Rob-a-Bye Baby

1987

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

HENRY and SHAWN are sitting at the table over breakfast. HENRY is explaining something rather emphatically.

HENRY:
So then this, um, guy with pliers comes in, probably with safety goggles, maybe some sort of fire retardant cover all. He starts doing his thing, twisting and turning. There's all sorts of fluids just spraying all over the place. Then this hydraulic lift comes into play, wheeling everything out of there. There you have it. All right? Let's clean up.

SHAWN:
Wait. That's how babies are born?

HENRY:
Yes?

SHAWN:
With a hydraulic lift?

HENRY:
More or less.

SHAWN:
But how are they made?

HENRY:
Uh, Shawn, more important question, how many hats are in the room?

SHAWN:
None. How are they made?

HENRY:
Hats? Nowadays, I hear most of them are made in China. Let's go. (stands)

SHAWN:
Forget it. (stands and walks away) Maybe I'll go ask Mom.

HENRY:
(grabs SHAWN'S shirt and pulls him back) D... don't, no! No. Wait, wait, come back here. Come back here, come back here. (thinks) All right. Tuck in your shirt before you talk to her.

SHAWN sighs as he turns around, tucking in his shirt.

PRESENT DAY

EXT. SBPD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk through the parking lot.

SHAWN:
All right, tell me exactly what she said. Use her words.

GUS:
She said, "Hello, this is Chief Vick."

SHAWN:
It's a good start, Gus. I love it when she says that.

GUS:
"I have something big to talk to you about. It's top secret. Come down to the station as soon as you can."

SHAWN:
Do you realize what this means? It means we're taking it to the next level. She said Big and Top Secret. That's two of our favorite '80s movies.

They enter the building.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

GUS:
I read about the international yacht bandit. I bet you we're going undercover on a yacht.

SHAWN:
Gus, let's not get ahead of ourselves. She may want us to catch that guy who's been stalking lingerie models.

GUS:
I know what it is. Last night on the news, I saw something about a blimp.

They stop walking.

SHAWN:
Blimp rides!

GUS:
Blimp rides! (does little dance)

SHAWN:
Shotgun. (walks towards VICK'S office)

GUS:
(follows) You can't call shotgun on a blimp.

SHAWN:
You can call shotgun anywhere except a crowded movie theater.

GUS:
There's only two seats...

VICK opens her office door.

VICK:
All right, close the blinds, shut the door, and remain completely silent. This is big.

VICK steps away from the door and SHAWN and GUS hurry inside.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS quickly close the door and blinds.

SHAWN:
(whispers to GUS) This is big.

VICK:
Look, I'm trusting you both to be professional and to keep this matter completely confidential.

GUS:
You got it.

SHAWN:
If you knew how many secrets I was keeping from you already, you'd totally trust me.

VICK:
It involves a nanny.

SHAWN:
Nanny serial killer? Nanny on the run?

GUS:
Nanny arsonist?

SHAWN:
Does she fly a blimp, by chance?

VICK:
No. I need you to hire me a nanny.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN:
Our big case is finding you a nanny? For your baby?

VICK:
Well, I'd be hiring you privately, of course. But I cannot stress how important this is.

GUS:
Of course. Our children are our most precious resources.

VICK:
Yes, that. Also, I haven't slept in weeks. See, my nephew was nannying her. And then he went back to nursing school. And ever since he left, she won't fall asleep, which means that I don't fall asleep. Are you up for this job?!

SHAWN:
I... (nudged by GUS) Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

VICK:
See, I can run the background checks on the nannies. Of course, not to mention, the drug testing, the psychological briefings, but I want to hire you both to psychically read the best candidate.

SHAWN:
Look, Chief. With all due respect, I think our services might be better utilized...

VICK:
Your services are best utilized by doing exactly what I say. You are not my first choice, Mr. Spencer. And I cannot stress how important this is. I... Need... Sleep! (sits)

SHAWN:
All right, so, uh, while we're looking for this babysitter...

VICK & GUS:
Nanny.

SHAWN:
How about we also hop on board the yacht bandit case? Because I think...

VICK:
Oh, no. No, no, no. (stands) No, no way. If I'm hiring you privately, then this is the only case that you're going to be working on. I mean, when you're working on police cases, it's not like you take private cases as well. Or do you?

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
No.

GUS:
Of course not.

SHAWN:
We don't do that.

GUS:
That would be unprofessional.

SHAWN:
It would break the psychic/client... Code.

GUS:
We wouldn't even think of it.

VICK:
Great. You can go ahead and leave the door open.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS exit VICK'S office, depressed over their "big" case. LASSITER is ordering detectives around in regards to a case. JULIET is with him.

LASSITER:
Well, Harry, you and Deeshaw start a timeline. McNab, I want you to help Schwartz go over the witness statements.

BUZZ:
Right away.

LASSITER:
Dobson! I want you on tactical! Where the hell is Dobson?

SHAWN:
Look, Gus, a real case.

GUS pulls SHAWN away.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS and SHAWN are at their desks, searching online with their laptops.

GUS:
What do you have?

SHAWN:
Something, something, Lassiter's case. Dude, this blows with a capital Z.

GUS:
Shawn, this is the only case we're supposed to be working on. Besides, it's really important. Nannies are essential parts of today's working nuclear families.

SHAWN:
They're babysitters who drive.

GUS:
Might I remind you that this is a private case for the chief of police to find a caretaker for her child? If we screw this up, we'll be on her bad side for pretty much ever.

SHAWN:
(stands and walks to front of desk) Gus, you're not going to find a nanny on the internet. If they're posting there, they're already too desperate. It's like online dating. Remember when you went on Matchmaker.com?

GUS:
You mean when you posted a profile of me without my knowledge?

SHAWN:
Right. And all the women who responded were complete freaks.

GUS:
That's because you said I was looking for a woman who was strong enough to hold me.

SHAWN:
I didn't think they would take it literally. Look, dude, all the good nannies are employed. We gotta do some field work. We gotta find the right nanny and steal her for Chief Vick. We should go to a playground in a really good neighborhood.

GUS:
That's actually a good idea.

SHAWN:
Plus this way, we can race on the monkey bars.

EXT. PARK, DAY

Children play on the playground watched by mothers and nannies. SHAWN and GUS sit on a bench. GUS is taking notes as SHAWN eats jelly beans.

SHAWN:
You know, Gus, we may be working the lowest stakes case of our short careers, but there's something nice about just sitting and enjoying a sunny day at the park.

GUS:
Shawn, concentrate. Look over there. The one in the overalls. She seems to be using reverse psychology on that ten-year-old, which is actually a pretty good idea.

SHAWN:
(makes a face) You know what's not a good idea?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Pineapple and movie theater popcorn flavored jelly beans. (leans over and spits out jelly beans) That's disgusting.

GUS:
Shawn, stop spitting. You're scaring the children.

A little girl in braids stops in front of them.

GUS:
(takes off sunglasses) Hi. Would you like some candy?

SHAWN holds up the box of jelly beans and the girl runs away.

SHAWN:
I can't say that I blame her. These are disgusting. I mean, these are really horrible. (pops more into his mouth) Why can't I stop eating them?

GUS:
(tucks notepad into back pocket) That's it. We're splitting up. You're freaking out the kids. And me. (stands and walks away)

SHAWN:
Fine.

GUS strides back and grabs the box of candy from SHAWN and then leaves.

SHAWN:
Thank you for that. I'm serious.

SHAWN spits out the candy and stands. He looks up when he hears two nannies talking on another bench. He makes his way closer to listen.

NANNY 1:
I mean, I thought this was supposed to be a safe neighborhood.

NANNY 2:
Just because you're rich doesn't mean you're safe. (calls to charge) Marissa, get off of her now!

NANNY 1:
So you know Annie? She worked for the Bermans? She had to go to the police station because they thought she might be a material witness 'cause of when the house by them got robbed. So... (calls to charge) Dakota! Let someone else go on the slide! They spoil that little girl so hard. So then, an...

NANNY 1 stops when she sees SHAWN standing beside the bench.

SHAWN:
Perry! Luke! (looks over at twin boys) I'll be sitting right here. Remember, stranger danger! "Stranger danger". The parents make me say that. Hi, I'm Shawn. I'm, uh, I'm a manny around here.

NANNY 1:
Oh, I'm Ada. This is Jaynie. Are you with an agency?

SHAWN:
No, I don't model. Strictly a manny. (sits next to ADA)

ADA:
Um, no, most of the families in this neighborhood get their nannies from our agency.

SHAWN:
Oh, which one is that?

JAYNIE:
Red Balloon. You should talk to them about getting reassigned. Ada's freaking out because she doesn't feel safe working in The Heights anymore.

SHAWN:
Why not? Oh, gosh. Is there a lot of crime around here? What kind?

JAYNIE:
Just some burglaries.

ADA:
Just? All these houses.

JAYNIE:
Only three.

ADA:
Three that we've heard about. (to SHAWN) They all happen in, like, the middle of the day, and all of them had security systems and everything, and it didn't matter.

JAYNIE:
Yeah, but it's not like it's your stuff they're stealing. So what do you care?

ADA:
I don't like to be around it. (calls to charges) Cody! Wyoming, get your foot out of that dog!

GUS is walking in another section of the park. He sees a nanny sitting on a bench and joins her.

NANNY:
Hi.

GUS:
Hi. Which one is yours?

NANNY:
Oh, uh, I'm the nanny for those two.

The NANNY points to the same twins that SHAWN had used as his cover. They are fighting.

GUS:
Oh, really. Do they always fight like that?

NANNY:
Pretty much. Which one's yours?

GUS:
Oh, no kids. Just me. So what are your thoughts on discipline? Do you spank?

The NANNY looks at him like he's a pervert. A small soccer balls rolls over and GUS picks it up. A BOY runs over.

GUS:
(holds out ball) Here you go.

BOY:
(takes ball) Thank you.

GUS:
You're welcome. Is that your nanny right there? (motions to a nanny sitting on a bench)

BOY:
No. She is. (points to a nanny talking on the phone as she reads a magazine)

GUS:
Oh. So she doesn't always pay attention to where you are, huh? It would be pretty easy for you to get away and she wouldn't even know.

The BOY looks over at the NANNY before walking away.

GUS:
Kids. I just want to eat 'em up.

>>>LATER>>>

SHAWN peers out from behind a tree. GUS looks out from another tree. SHAWN waves him over and they meet halfway.

GUS:
None of these nannies will talk to me. Even the kids are avoiding me. Tell me the truth. Do I smell weird?

SHAWN:
(sniffs GUS) Nah, it's just the usual. Jerk chicken and new car smell. Look, I was talking to those two nannies, right?

GUS:
Oh yeah? You think they may be right for Chief Vick?

SHAWN:
Nah. They're terrible. Yelling at the kids, gossiping. All they paid attention to is themselves. But here's the good news, this neighborhood is rife with crime.

We hear a police siren.

SHAWN:
See what I mean?

GUS:
(takes off glasses) Shawn, I think you're forgetting why we're here. (points at SHAWN with glasses before putting them back on)

SHAWN:
Did you really just do that?

GUS:
What? (takes off glasses)

BUZZ:
(walks over) Hey, guys!

SHAWN:
Buzz!

BUZZ:
Listen, I got a call about two creepy dudes hanging out in the playground.

GUS:
Really? I haven't seen anything, but I'll keep my eyes open.

SHAWN:
Yeah, we've just been here hanging out in the bushes. Oh, boy.

BUZZ:
Sorry about this. (motions to the squad car)

BUZZ leads SHAWN and GUS past the nannies and children as they stand at the edge of the playground; the nannies with their arms protectively around the children. They stop beside the car.

BUZZ:
I'm so sorry. Hey, no hard feelings, right?

SHAWN:
Of course not. I mean, if you have to have a Jackie Earle Haley moment, you'd... You want it to be from Bad News Bears.

GUS:
Maybe Breaking Away.

SHAWN:
Not Little Children.

BUZZ:
Listen, I'd be happy to give you guys a ride to wherever you need to go.

RADIO:
Attention all officers. We have a call on a 4-5-9 break-in at 3192 Roscoe.

SHAWN:
There. We need to go there.

BUZZ:
You need to go to a crime scene?

SHAWN:
Yeah, it's crazy. The Chief asked us to look into any new burglaries in the neighborhood while we were here at the park.

BUZZ:
Okay. Fine. Hop in.

BUZZ walks around to the driver's side. SHAWN opens the front passenger door but GUS slams it shut.

GUS:
Whoa! Why you always get to sit in the front?

SHAWN:
I called shotgun.

GUS:
No, you didn't.

BOTH:
Shotgun.

They fight over the door.

EXT. 3192 ROSCOE, DAY

BUZZ pulls the squad car up to the house, siren on.

GUS:
(off-screen) Stop it! Stop it!

BUZZ parks the car and we see all three men in the front seat of the car, GUS in the middle. SHAWN opens the door and both practically fall out. GUS closes the car door as they walk towards the house.

GUS:
Chief Vick better not catch us here, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Would you relax? She's not gonna show up at some random burglary scene. We spent all afternoon on that nanny thing. This is like a coffee break.

A dead body is wheeled out on a gurney.

SHAWN:
The coolest coffee break ever.

They continue up the front walk and SHAWN notices the sign for StarTek Security in the front garden.

GUS:
This is so wrong, Shawn.

SHAWN:
That must be why it feels so good.

They walk through the open front door.

INT. 3192 ROSCOE, FOYER, DAY

SHAWN notices the alarm is working properly with a green light.

GUS:
We already have a case.

INT. 3192 ROSCOE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

They walk into the living room.

SHAWN:
Gus, we can do both. It's called multitasking.

SHAWN looks around the room and relays the scenario leading up to the crime.

SHAWN:
Okay. Looks like somebody came home, kicked off their shoes, made some chamomile tea. What ever happened to throwing back a few beers after work?

On the table by the sofa are a box of tissues with some used ones around it and a bottle of cough medicine.

GUS:
Whatever happened to cleaning? This is disgusting.

INT. 3192 ROSCOE, MASTER BEDROOM, DAY

SHAWN looks into the walk-in closet and sees and empty, open safe in the wall.

SHAWN:
(enters closet) Whoever broke in, managed to disarm security, find the safe and open it.

GUS:
And killed a guy.

SHAWN:
So this is where Mr. Tea-time got steeped.

GUS:
That doesn't even make sense.

SHAWN:
Got brewed? Got tea bagged!

A smashed floor lamp lies on the floor between the bed and window. There is blood on the base and the rug.

GUS:
That must be what killed him.

SHAWN:
(steps into the bedroom) Good eye, Gus.

GUS:
Thank you.

SHAWN stands in the doorway between the closet and the bedroom and expounds his theory. GUS walks into the closet and looks around.

SHAWN:
(stands in the doorway) So Mr. Teatime wasn't feeling well. He comes home early, surprises the intruder. The murder didn't have a weapon. Reaches for the first thing he can find. Bam! Didn't mean to hurt anybody. He's just a normal thief, right? Dude... (walks into closet) I bet this is connected to those robberies the nannies were talking about. (looks out window and sees VICK arrive) Chief Vick!

Both duck below the window into a squat.

GUS:
Man, we gotta get out of here.

GUS creeps out "normally" whereas SHAWN stays in his squat and moves sideways as they leave the room.

SHAWN:
I think walking like this makes everything more exciting.

GUS:
But...

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

GUS sits on the corner of a desk as SHAWN leans against a tall file cabinet across from him.

GUS:
I do not think this is a good idea. She was clear about only wanting us to find her a nanny.

SHAWN:
Are you kidding me? I'll have a psychic vision about the whole string of robberies. She will love it.

LASSITER, VICK and JULIET walk down the hall towards them.

LASSITER:
I haven't finished the report yet.

VICK:
Is your other arm in a sling?

LASSITER:
Excuse me?

VICK:
I don't want excuses, Carlton. I just want the report.

LASSITER:
I'm not giving excuses.

VICK:
Then why are you still talking? Head detective, my ass. (walks to coffee machine)

JULIET:
Uh, listen, I can finish the report.

LASSITER:
I can do my own job, O'Hara.

JULIET:
I know you...

LASSITER:
I can do my own job, O'Hara! (walks away)

VICK:
(tries to pour coffee but it's empty) Oh! Who finished the coffee? Didn't make a fresh pot? I mean, who does that? What kind of person acts like that?

Everyone stops to look at VICK as she has her little breakdown. SHAWN and GUS try to leave without VICK knowing.

VICK:
(rushes up to SHAWN and GUS) Ooh, Shawn, Gus, hi! (puts arms around them) Good to see you. (ushers them to her office) Come on in. Come on in.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK enters the office first, excited by their presence.

VICK:
So you found me a nanny.

GUS:
Actually, we were working on that when...

SHAWN:
I had a vision. It was a robbery turned to murder. There's a light...

VICK:
Oh, do you know who the murder is? Unless you can name me the murder in ten seconds, then I'm not interested. Ten, nine, one. I hired you to find me a nanny, and that's it.

GUS:
Yes, that's it.

SHAWN:
Absolutely. But, Chief, I have this feeling...

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, I thought you understood that when I hired you, this was to be your top priority. Your only priority.

SHAWN:
Well, it is. This is it. In fact, we even narrowed it down to the final three candidates.

VICK:
Oh, oh! Oh, that's great!

SHAWN and GUS head for the door.

SHAWN:
(whispers to GUS) Go find three candidates.

GUS jabs SHAWN in the side with his elbow. They each open a door and step into the hall.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN looks over to the bullpen where JULIET is talking with LASSITER and some other detectives.

JULIET:
This has to be connected to the other burglaries in The Heights.

GUS:
Don't even think about it.

SHAWN:
No, you go ahead. I'm just going to say a quick hello.

GUS:
Okay.

GUS leaves and SHAWN walks to the bullpen.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN walks over as close as he dares and sees photos of houses spread across the desk. He sees the case numbers are all through Startek. He pulls out his phone and walks towards them.

SHAWN:
(into phone) Hold on a second. I might need to make that a large.

LASSITER:
Can I help you?

SHAWN stops and leans against the post by the desk, his hand with the phone on the other side, taking photos of the desk.

SHAWN:
You guys want to go in with me on a meat-lover's cheesy crust?

LASSITER:
No time for a pizza party, Spencer.

SHAWN:
Nothing helps a big case more than a belly full of pepperoni.

LASSITER:
We're busy.

SHAWN:
Okay. (into phone) Keep it a medium, but yes to the crazy bread.

JULIET:
It makes sense that all these burglaries were connected 'cause they all have the same MO's.

JULIET and LASSITER:
Daytime burglaries...

LASSITER:
Hidden valuables found and stolen. Disabled alarm systems.

JULIET:
Yes, that's what I was in the middle of saying.

LASSITER:
Well, then say it.

SHAWN:
(into phone) Uh, hold on a second. (to others) Uh, jalapeno poppers, cinnamon wings?

LASSITER:
Walk away.

SHAWN:
Okay.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS escorts a woman to the door from the main office. Three others are waiting to be interviewed.

GUS:
Thank you very much for your time. Now if you all can just wait here for one sec... Shawn, I'm glad you're here. 'Scuse me. (walks with SHAWN to the kitchen) I'm feeling really good about these nannies. Jean has a background in Montessori, and Sue has some interesting ideas about establishing nap time routines that I kind of like.

SHAWN:
All right. (looks at women) No. No good. None of them.

GUS:
What? Why?

SHAWN:
Slob, psycho, slut.

GUS:
I spent hours interviewing them, calling references. And you just come in here and dismiss them in two seconds?

SHAWN:
Well, take a look, Gus. The one on the far left is a slob. She's smelling her own armpit. Psycho there has been scribbling in her diary from the moment I walked in.

GUS:
So? Maybe she's just creative?

SHAWN:
It's the same sentence over and over again. Now, I don't know what that sentence is, but there is no configuration of words that makes that behavior acceptable.

GUS:
Fine. That still leaves Fiona. Why is she a slut?

SHAWN:
That was more me predicting her future.

FIONA looks up at SHAWN and waves with a small smile. SHAWN waves back. He then sees that she is reading a bridal magazine.

SHAWN:
Aw, man.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
(walks to the pass-through window) All right, everybody out. Sorry, ladies. The position has been filled. Don't drive angry.

The applicants file out.

GUS:
Why did you do that?

SHAWN:
Gus, she was getting married.

GUS:
So? She can still work for Chief Vick.

SHAWN:
No, she's consumed with planning her wedding. (opens fridge and takes out OJ) She was studying that bridal magazine like it was a textbook. After she's done with that, she'll be on the fertility fast track. (pours juice) Then she'll have her own baby. And Chief Vick will be out another nanny. And I do not want to have to do all this work again. (stands in front of GUS' desk)

GUS:
(opens laptop) And what work exactly are you doing?

SHAWN:
How about progress on our actual case? Looks like all these robberies are inside jobs. The key is finding the connection between the victims. (pulls out phone)

GUS:
But we don't know anything about the other houses that were robbed.

SHAWN shushes him.

GUS:
All I'm saying is...

SHAWN shushes him.

GUS:
I'm just trying to say...

SHAWN shushes him.

GUS:
Don't make me slap you, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(holds out phone) Check it out. I got some snapshots of the evidence.

SHAWN scrolls through the photos and sees the shape of the Startek sign on the front lawn of one of the house.

SHAWN:
Well, at least two of the victims have something in common.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Startek Security Company.

INT. STARTEK, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET question an officer in the monitoring room.

LASSITER:
And you don't find it strange that all four of these homes had Startek security, yet none of them were secure?

OFFICER:
Actually, people get overconfident with a security system and neglect taking even the most basic precautions. Like turning the system on, for example.

JULIET:
So you're saying all of these homeowners just forgot to turn on their alarms?

OFFICER:
That's one theory.

JULIET:
That's a pretty flimsy theory.

LASSITER:
(cuts off JULIET) Yeah, I don't think that's what happened.

SHAWN enters the room with another OFFICER.

SHAWN:
What I'm going to need from you, Spock, is a list.

OFFICER 2:
I just told you, yes, I am second in command, but my name is Gary Mills.

SHAWN:
I'm at a loss. You'll have to talk to Bones and get back to me. (sees the detectives) Jules. Lassie.

LASSITER:
Why are you here?

SHAWN:
Well, I was just in the neighborhood and my ears started tingling, and then they got pointier. Oh! And my hand, my hand started doing this. (holds up his right hand, his four fingers split open) All on its own. Like in that show.

JULIET:
(points) Star Trek!

LASSITER:
And this is Startek. Hilarious. What's your point?

SHAWN:
Excuse me for trying to take you on a wonderful psychic journey, okay? I think there's a connection between this place and the string of robberies in The Heights.

LASSITER:
How'd you know about the robberies?

SHAWN:
I, uh, felt a burning when I sat down.

LASSITER:
Forget I asked. (moves to lean on the counter in front of OFFICER) Please excuse my pseudo-colleague's presence. Now assuming that all four of our homeowners didn't just "forget" to turn on their systems, I think a Startek employee could've gotten those access codes to break in.

While LASSITER is talking, SHAWN notices the locations of the robbed houses on a map and their proximity to each other.

OFFICER:
You remind me of one of my professors. Did you ever teach at DeVry School of Technology?

LASSITER:
No.

SHAWN smiles at the comment as he starts to look around.

OFFICER:
Well, I had one of these professors who often had harebrained theories like yours. If we were really gonna rob any of the houses that we monitor, we would choose one in a totally higher income bracket. (shows LASSITER a picture of a large mansion) Take a look at this mansion, huh? I would rob this bad boy so fast your head would spin.

LASSITER:
Really.

OFFICER:
Yeah.

LASSITER:
How?

JULIET:
Lassiter, I don't...

LASSITER:
(holds up hand to shush her) O'Hara, please.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS enters the office on the phone with SHAWN. He's drinking a coffee.

GUS:
What do you want, Shawn?

SHAWN: (over phone)
Gus, there's no way it can be these security guys.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. STARTEK, DAY

SHAWN talks with GUS over the phone away from JULIET and LASSITER.

SHAWN:
I mean, they want to be cops, but they're really just on domestic detail.

GUS:
Really? Like you're a wannabe detective following a case we're not even on, when you should be finding Chief Vick a new nanny.

SHAWN:
I trust you to head that up, Gus. Meanwhile, I'm going to borrow your car, check out those other houses that were robbed.

GUS:
No way. I will not have my Echo be a part of your flagrant disobeying of the Chief. Use your motorcycle.

SHAWN:
Dude, I can't do recon with that on suburban streets.

GUS:
Help me find the nanny, and then I'll take you.

SHAWN:
(scoffs) Gus, I'm a grown man. I don't have to depend on others to drive me around. Okay?

GUS:
Fine.

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN is riding with HENRY in his pickup.

SHAWN:
(looks out passenger window) Whoa, slow down. Slow down.

HENRY:
What are we looking for again?

SHAWN:
My kinkajou. He's got to be around here somewhere. Maybe he's more in the middle of the block.

HENRY:
Your kinka-what?

SHAWN:
Kinkajou. It's a 12-inch, monkey-like mammal. It's become quite vogue to keep as a pet. Dermot Mulroney had one named "Baby Love" but I named mine "Red Hot Monkey Love".

HENRY:
All right, Shawn, cut the crap. I'm only doing this 'cause you agreed to mow the lawn. It's time to fess up. What is really going on here?

SHAWN:
All right, fine. There's been a string of robberies in The Heights, and I need to get a closer look at one of the houses that got robbed.

HENRY:
Why didn't you just say so?

SHAWN:
Because it's more fun to say "kinkajou."

HENRY parks the truck and they both get out.

HENRY:
All right, which one?

SHAWN:
(points) That one. (joins HENRY on the sidewalk)

HENRY:
Yeah? Well, that's a stupid house to rob.

SHAWN:
Does anyone live up to your standards? Maybe we can get a hold of the burglar's number, you can call, tell him how disappointed you are.

HENRY:
Shawn, take a look at all the houses on this block. Of all of 'em, tell me why that one would be your last choice to break into?

SHAWN:
I don't know, Dad. I...

HENRY:
Shawn. Now.

SHAWN looks around at the other houses in the immediate area. One has overgrown landscaping, virtually blocking it from the street. Another has newspapers accumulated on the front stairs.

SHAWN:
Because all the other houses are easier targets than the one that actually got robbed. Neighbor two houses down has been gone for several days, didn't bother to suspend their newspaper delivery.

HENRY:
Good. What else?

SHAWN:
The house on the other side is completely hidden by those trees and bushes. It's the perfect vantage point for a burglar, especially during the day time.

HENRY:
Not to mention our house has a security system.

SHAWN:
And bars on the windows.

HENRY:
This was not a crime of chance, Shawn. That house was chosen for a reason.

SHAWN:
(in fake French accent) There can only be one.

HENRY:
What?

SHAWN:
I thought we were doing lines from Highlander. My bad.

HENRY:
Let's get out of here. (heads for the truck)

SHAWN:
(stops Henry and talks with a Scottish accent) Wait. That sensation you're feeling, that is the Quickening.

HENRY:
Everyone can do Connery. Your Lambert sucks. (pats SHAWN on the back and walks to the truck)

SHAWN:
At least I have a Lambert.

SHAWN looks over at the house and sees JAYNIE walking across the lawn. She's on the phone.

JAYNIE:
Hey, Ada, it's Jaynie. They let me out early. Want to meet up tonight?

SHAWN notices that JAYNIE is wearing Coach sunglasses.

SHAWN:
A nanny wouldn't be able to afford Coach sunglasses, am I right?

HENRY:
Well, she should be able to. Nannies are criminally underpaid.

SHAWN:
Right, because our children are our most precious resources.

HENRY:
Because children are maddening hellions. A great nanny can make all the difference in the world. Haven't you seen Nanny 911?

SHAWN:
No, I'm still trying to catch up on my Dog Whisperers.

HENRY:
Nannies on that are brilliant. I wish I had one of 'em when you were a kid. (gets in truck)

SHAWN:
Uh, don't beat yourself up, Pop. Sure, most of my good traits come from Mom. But you, uh... No, that's really all I got. (gets in truck)

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN rushes into VICK'S office. The woman is sitting at her desk, head propped on her hand as she looks forward.

SHAWN:
Okay, Chief, let me begin by saying no, we have not found you a nanny yet. But I have had a vision about nannies, ironically. Rings of nannies! (sees VICK hasn't noticed him) Uh, rings around my collar. Of thieves. Rings of thieves! Supplementing their paltry incomes as nannies. Rogue nannies robbing their bosses' Aykroyds and Belushis. Neighbors! Robbing their bosses' neighbors! (steps forward to plead his case) Chief, if I can just get a little closer to these robberies... And... And... And we would still find you a nanny eventually.

VICK'S head drops from her hand and she jerks up quickly. SHAWN pulls back, confused. VICK realizes she's not alone.

VICK:
Oh. Mr. Spencer. I'm sorry. I must've fallen asleep.

SHAWN:
That is so creepy. Your eyes were wide open.

VICK:
Yeah. I learned to do that back when I was on stakeouts. (pours bought coffee into her cup) I have never been so sleep-deprived in my life. But thank goodness you found me a nanny.

SHAWN:
N... no. No, we haven't...We haven't done that yet.

VICK:
Then why are you here?

SHAWN:
That's what I was saying. (sits) I've got some very strong psychic rumblings about those robberies.

VICK laughs and SHAWN joins in.

VICK:
I gave you explicit instructions. And you're here to tell me that you've completely disregarded everything I said?

SHAWN:
No, no, no. Not completely. Well, look, if you're gonna put it like that, then sort of.

VICK:
Well, let me put it just like this, (stands and leans over desk) and listen very closely, because I want you to get it clearly this time. You are fired. Yeah.

SHAWN:
Ah! From which case?

VICK:
All of them.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, NIGHT

GUS:
Trying to solve that case is what got us in trouble in the first place, Shawn!

SHAWN:
She said she wanted me to name the murder. As long as I could do it in ten seconds.

GUS:
(goes into kitchen) And as long as it didn't distract from the nanny search.

SHAWN:
So you find the perfect nanny before she does. I'll find the murder for the police. And voila! She's loving us again.

GUS:
(opens fridge and takes out a jar or jelly) And exactly how is this plan different from what we were doing before?

SHAWN:
Because now we're renegades, dude. It's so hardcore! Working without the Chief's knowledge. Racing against a ticking clock for her approval. It's gonna be so much more exciting. (leans on desk) Can't you feel it?

GUS:
(makes a sandwich) No, Shawn, I don't feel it. I feel depression. I feel a series of missed payments on our rent. That's the only thing that motivates me to think we need to fix this.

SHAWN:
I need to get more information on those two nannies from the park. Maybe get into that agency where they both work.

GUS:
(puts jelly away) And how do you plan on doing that? It's not like you can pretend you're a nanny. The agency does do extensive security checks on who they hire.

SHAWN:
But not necessarily on the parents who hire them. (walks over to GUS) Come on, buddy. What do you say? Do a little cameo on My Two Dads?

GUS:
That show was canceled for a reason, Shawn. I'm sorry. You're gonna have to find someone else to co-parent with. (walks away)

SHAWN:
I was gonna let you be Greg Evigan.

EXT. CAF√â, DAY

The caf√© is located across from the beach. JULIET comes out in mid conversation on her phone. She holds a pastry in her other hand. A covered cup of coffee is tucked in the crook of her elbow.

JULIET:
I just think that Startek security is a dead end. Okay. All right. Fine. What if I go investigate a different... Yes. I know that you are lead detective, Lassiter. Oh. (pulls phone away from her mouth) Going through a tunnel. Gotta go. (ends call and takes an angry bite of her pastry)

SHAWN arrives.

SHAWN:
Whoa!

JULIET:
Please let me eat my frustration in peace, Shawn.

SHAWN:
There's this dark cloud surrounding you. It's starving your chi. Yeah. And down at the station, I can see a raccoon with dark circles under his eyes. No, her eyes. Oh, God. It's the chief. Chief Vick is becoming Chief Coon, and she's... She's lashing out at everyone.

JULIET:
That's true.

SHAWN:
Especially Lassie, who in turn is taking his frustrations out on you. Look, Jules, you gotta take your chi back. Take it back. And that means doing something big, something risky. Something that'll help you blow this case wide open. (whips off sunglasses and gets down on one knee) Marry me, Juliet.

The patrons of the caf√© turn around in their seats and clap. JULIET grabs SHAWN by the arm and pulls him up and drags him away.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS is interviewing another nanny.

GUS:
What are your opinions on Ferberizing the baby?

APPLICANT:
Oh my God. Never. That's disgusting.

GUS makes a large "X" on her application.

GUS:
Do you have any remedies for teething pains?

APPLICANT 2:
Two Valiums.

GUS:
You would give the baby Valium?

APPLICANT 2:
Oh, no. Of course not. Those are for me so I can deal with the crying. I just give the baby half a Valium.

GUS makes an "X" on her application. The next applicant is a goth dressed in black with piercings and long black hair with colored strands. He makes another "X".

EXT. BEACH, DAY

SHAWN explains to JULIET as they walk.

SHAWN:
Look, Jules, you don't actually have to marry me, okay? Just... Just pose as my wife when we go to the Red Balloon Nanny Agency. I need to get a better psychic vibe on a couple of their nannies.

JULIET:
And you need a nanny why?

SHAWN:
Two particular nannies. I think they're behind the robberies in The Heights.

JULIET:
So you're saying that this string of high-tech cat burglaries, one that ended in murder, were caused by a couple of 19-year-old nannies?

SHAWN:
Don't be ridiculous. Only one of them is 19. The other one's a slightly zaftic Polish nanny in her thirties.

JULIET:
Shawn, I can't help you do this.

SHAWN:
Oh no, no, no. You wouldn't be helping me. I would be helping you. To solve the case the way you think it needs to be solved. Jules, to get your chi back, investigate these nannies with me. Otherwise your chi's going to shrivel up and starve to death.

EXT. CAF√â, DAY

SHAWN:
You need to feed your chi. Besides, I wasn't going to say anything, but I had a vision of us being married. (JULET laughs) I know it's probably this undercover thing we're gonna do, but it might have been a vision from our future. (takes her hand) Mr. and Mrs. Juliet Spencer O'Hara.

SHAWN lifts her hand to his lips as if to kiss it and she pulls her hand away.

JULIET:
Fine. I'll do it.

SHAWN:
(to the patrons of the caf√©) She said yes, everybody! She loves me so much!

The patrons applaud.

JULIET:
But only for detective work. (they walk through the caf√©'s patio) I don't buy into this whole husband and kids thing. Marriage is just a contractual obligation that the state mandated centuries ago when wives were considered property. But if we are going to pretend, this is what our wedding was like. It's sunset on a beach in Antigua...

INT. RED BALLOON AGENCY, RECEPTION, DAY

JULIET sits in a comfortable armchair and talks about their wedding as she holds a teddy bear against her chest.

JULIET:
So then I walk down the aisle to an a cappella version of James Taylor's Only One, and by this time, the flower girls have tossed the peony petals into a soft, butterfly formation...

SHAWN has zoned out as JULIET continues to describe her fictitious wedding. The RECEPTIONIST enters the room.

RECEPTIONIST:
Hi. I'll take you in to see the head of the agency now.

SHAWN gets up quickly and practically runs out the door. JULIET follows more sedately.

INT. RED BALLOON AGENCY, OFFICE, DAY

ABBY DANIELS greets SHAWN and JULIET standing behind her desk.

DANIELS:
Hi, I'm Abby Daniels. (sits and checks file) And it says here that you are Mr. and Mrs. Levon Tostig.

SHAWN and JULIET sit as well.

SHAWN:
That's correct.

DANIELS:
Why don't you tell me a little bit about your child?

JULIET:
Well, we had little Millicent in a home birth with a doula, and afterwards, (places her hands affectionately on SHAWN'S arm and shoulder) Levon here buried my placenta in the backyard.

SHAWN:
Whoa!

DANIELS:
Some of our nannies are very environmentally conscious. They're into homeopathic methods.

JULIET:
Great.

SHAWN:
What kind of background checks do you run on these nannies?

DANIELS:
Well, I'm glad you asked that, because the safety of your children is something we pride ourselves on here at Red Balloon.

SHAWN:
I like that very much.

DANIELS:
Well, why don't I show you a little bit around our offices? And you can see some of the services that we offer here. (stands and walks around desk)

SHAWN:
Great.

SHAWN and JULIET stand.

JULIET:
(softly) So getting any psychic vibrations on your two suspects yet, Levon?

SHAWN:
I think I got thrown off picturing your placenta.

They follow DANIELS from the office.

INT. RED BALLOON AGENCY, TECH ROOM, DAY

DANIELS leads them to another room lined with cameras and videos as well as the equipment with which to fix them. Inside is an older, heavyset man. He quickly picks up a tin of chewing tobacco and slips it into his shirt pocket.

DANIELS:
Now this is Steve Hitchcock. He's in charge of the baby bonding cameras we install. Part of every nanny placement package.

JULIET:
What are baby bonding cameras?

HITCHCOCK:
Well, they're a series of webcams we set up in your home. You can log on any time during the day and see how your child and the nanny are doing.

SHAWN:
So you're spying on them.

DANIELS:
Oh, no. Not at all. The nannies are aware these cameras are installed. It's more to keep in touch with your child. Not to mention having the nanny know you may be watching her at any time, it encourages her to be extra responsible.

As DANIELS talks, SHAWN reaches an arm around JULIET and gives her a quick hug. She gives a fake smile.

HITCHCOCK:
You're the only ones with the access to the camera feed. You sign onto the web site using a unique password only you know.

DANIELS:
So you can see, not only do we run extensive background checks on our nannies, you can check on them whenever you like.

SHAWN'S cell rings.

SHAWN:
Ooh, uh, sweetie, why don't you tell them how we decorated little Millie's room, then they'll know how to set up the cameras. Excuse me. (answers phone and walks from the room)

JULIET:
Well, we decorated with a raspberry and sage theme. And then we did this pinstripe wallpaper that really accented the sea foam green that we had done in the crown molding.

INT. RED BALLOON AGENCY, OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN sneaks into the office and closes the door.

SHAWN:
Perfect timing, Gus. (ends call)

He opens the file cabinet and pulls out JAYNIE'S file. Her last place of employment was the Coach store.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLASHBACK

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN notices that JAYNIE is wearing Coach sunglasses.

SHAWN:
A nanny wouldn't be able to afford Coach sunglasses, am I right?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INT. RED BALLOON AGENCY, OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN puts the file back, closes the drawer and leaves the room.

INT. RED BALLOON AGENCY, TECH ROOM, DAY

JULIET is still describing the imaginary nursery.

JULIET:
Of course, I love what Nate Berkus did on Oprah's nursery theme week, so I took his idea and I did the long, flowing curtains, but only on two of the windows, even though there's four...

SHAWN returns to the room and knocks on the door.

SHAWN:
Honey, we should probably get going.

DANIELS:
Great! Well, if you have any other questions, you just let us know.

JULIET:
Thank you. I will.

DANIELS:
Or e-mail. E-mail is good too.

JULIET:
Okay.

DANIELS:
Okay.

SHAWN and JULIET leave.

INT. RED BALLOON AGENCY, FRONT HALL, DAY

JULIET'S phone rings as they head for the main door. She answers.

JULIET:
O'Hara. Uh-huh. Where? Okay, I'll be right there. (ends call) That was Lassiter. Wants me to meet him at some exotic reptile shop on Central. Said they found some of the stolen merchandise from the robberies.

SHAWN:
Ooh. Can I come? I'd love to see what my wife does at work all day.

With a smile, JULIET turns and heads out the door. SHAWN follows.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS is interviewing yet another nanny.

APPLICANT 3:
And then before every nap time, we read Good Night Moon and The Giving Tree.

GUS:
Those are my favorite books. (makes a note)

APPLICANT 3:
And then she lies down for a 45-minute nap, which I keep track of in my client sleep chart.

GUS:
I love charts. When can you start?

INT. EXOTIC PET STORE, DAY

SHAWN and JULIET duck under the police tape as they step inside the store. LASSITER is at the counter questioning with the OWNER.

LASSITER:
All right, when'd the items come in?

OWNER:
Jeez Louise. Does it look like I keep records in Quicken in here? Maybe Tuesday.

LASSITER:
Can you at least describe the person who sold them to you?

OWNER:
You get used to lookin' at lizards all day, people all start to look alike.

LASSITER:
Was it a man or a woman?

OWNER:
Boy, you ask some toughies. I think it was a guy.

LASSITER:
Pasty white guy, beatnik haircut, stupid grin?

OWNER:
I don't think so.

SHAWN sees an old paper cup in the garbage and notices traces of chewing tobacco. He remembers HITCHCOCK slipping some into his shirt pocket. He steps up to the counter.

SHAWN:
Was he roly-poly like a puffer fish? (puffs up cheeks)

LASSITER:
Spencer, what the hell?

OWNER:
Yeah. Yeah, he was.

SHAWN:
Now I'm seeing red. Was he red-faced like a koi fish? (makes a fish face)

OWNER:
Exactly.

SHAWN:
And did he spit a lot like a komodo dragon?

OWNER:
Just like a komodo.

LASSITER:
Great! I'll take this description down to our sketch artist at the aquarium. All right, tell me exactly which items this fish man sold.

JULIET pulls SHAWN away to the other side of the store.

JULIET:
(whispers) Your vision kinda sounds like that red-faced guy from the Red Balloon Nanny Agency... Steve.

SHAWN:
(whispers) I was thinking the Kool-Aid guy, but yours probably makes more sense.

JULIET:
Yeah. I'm going to head back down to the station, investigate them a little more, see if I can get a warrant.

SHAWN:
So it's not the nannies that are responsible for the burglaries, it's the agency.

JULIET:
Yeah.

JULIET leaves and SHAWN'S phone rings.

SHAWN:
Gus, I'm so glad you called.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. PSYCH OFFICE, DAY

GUS is relaxing behind his desk, a bottle of water in his hand.

GUS:
You're about to be a lot gladder. Chief Vick has officially forgiven us. I just found her a nanny.

SHAWN:
Oh, that's perfect. I think I just figured out who the bad guys are.

GUS:
The best part is she can start right away. Her security check is already done, because she works for the best agency in town.

SHAWN:
Oh, no. Please don't say the...

GUS:
Red Balloon Nanny Agency.

SHAWN closes his phone. GUS stares at his phone, surprised that SHAWN hung up on him.

EXT. STREET, DAY

GUS parks the Echo on the street in front of the Red Balloon Nanny Agency. The two step out of the car and walk towards the building.

GUS:
This is the part I hate, waiting for warrants.

SHAWN:
Oh, we're not waiting for warrants.

GUS:
Can you please tell me what we're doing here?

SHAWN:
Look, Gus, we know the W's of the crime. We know the "who", we know the "where". We're pretty solid on the "whereof". We're pretty sure of the "wheretofore". We're scratch on the whatchamacallit...

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
...'cause that's self-explanatory.

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
We don't have the "how".

GUS:
Why do we need to know the "how" if the guy's gonna be arrested?

SHAWN:
(sighs and stops at the base of the steps) Dude, I'm the one that has to do the wrap-up, remember? You want me to get up there with Eggs Benedict all over my face? The Canadian bacon in my hair? Hollandaise dripping down? I need zing. I'm a psychic. I gotta see everything.

GUS:
Come on.

INT. RED BALLOON AGENCY, RECEPTION, DAY

The RECEPTIONIST is sitting at the desk when SHAWN and GUS enter.

RECEPTIONIST:
Oh, hi, Levon. What are you doing here?

SHAWN:
This is Shmuel Coen. He's my best friend and godfather to my little Millicent. Now he's, uh, very overprotective and he insisted on coming by and getting a feel for the folks that are going to be caring for his little goddaughter.

RECEPTIONIST:
Oh, well, guys, I'm so sorry. But Steve and Abby, they're out doing home interviews with clients.

SHAWN exaggerates snapping his fingers in disappointment and sighs.

SHAWN:
You know what, we're okay with waiting.

Both men sit in the armchairs. GUS runs a ringer along the table checking for dust. SHAWN notices the RECEPTIONIST open a large bottle of aspirin. He picks up a toy and covers his mouth as he whispers to GUS.

SHAWN:
Dude, she has a headache. Start whistling something by Philip Glass.

They both lean back in the chairs. SHAWN puts the toy back on the table. GUS clears his throat and starts to whistle. SHAWN starts to gutturally clear his throat.

RECEPTIONIST:
Okay, you know what, guys? You don't have to wait out here. You know, I bet you'd be more comfy in Mrs. Daniel's office.

SHAWN:
(stands) You sure it's no trouble?

GUS stands as well.

RECEPTIONIST:
No, no. Not at all. You know where it is, right?

SHAWN and GUS walk to the door.

GUS:
Thank you.

INT. RED BALLOON AGENCY, OFFICE, DAY

GUS is still whistling as they enter the office. He stops as soon as SHAWN closes the door. GUS goes to the desk to search as SHAWN goes to the file cabinet.

GUS:
What kind of clues are we looking for?

SHAWN:
Any kind.

GUS sees a tobacco container in the garbage.

GUS:
Somebody chews tobacco.

SHAWN:
How about some new clues?

SHAWN looks across to the opposite wall and sees marks and tears in the wallpaper on either side of the bookcase. He crosses the room to examine more closely. He pounds on the wall.

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
Dude, I think this thing opens up. Scratches on both sides of the wall. It's, like, a secret door or something.

GUS comes over and starts pulling out books, looking for a latch. He turns a plaque holding preserved baby booties and the bookcase slides open. In front of them are a number of monitors showing different homes.

GUS:
Wow.

SHAWN:
Nicely done, Gus. These are feeds from the baby bonding cameras that the agency installs.

GUS:
It's kind of creepy.

SHAWN:
Yeah, especially since the only ones that are supposed to be able to access these feeds are the parents themselves.

GUS:
This is our proof, Shawn. They watch the footage from the cameras, get the security codes, see where people are hiding their valuables, and case out their houses. We got it, Shawn. Let's go. (turns for the door)

SHAWN:
Whoa!

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
No, that doesn't make any sense. None of the houses that got robbed had nannies working in them.

SHAWN sees the addresses taped underneath the monitors and remembered the addresses to the houses robbed from when he was in Startek.

SHAWN:
Dude, it wasn't the houses with the nannies. It was the houses next door.

GUS looks over at one of the monitors that shows DANIELS and HITCHCOCK at VICK'S house.

GUS:
Juliet's gonna have a hard time serving the warrant here at the Red Balloon, when the person she's trying to arrest is sitting in Chief Vick's living room!

SHAWN pulls out a tray in the center of the bookcase that has controls on it for the cameras.

SHAWN:
Sweet black licorice. I've got the "how". I've got to get Jules on the phone right away. (pulls out phone and calls JULIET) Time is of the essence here! Jules, it's Shawn. First of all, how are you? Oh, that sounds nice.

GUS:
(smacks SHAWN) Go on!

SHAWN:
Secondly, meet me at chief Vick's house pronto. I've had a big vision. Top seven of all time. (ends call) Let's go.

EXT. STREET, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET pull up in front of VICK'S house. SHAWN and GUS get out of the Echo. LASSITER and JULIET get out of their car.

SHAWN:
Thanks for getting here so quickly, guys. Where's your baby gift?

LASSITER:
A what?

SHAWN:
The baby gift. Lassie, we're about to enter the Chief's home. You can't just barge in, guns a-blazing. This is delicate.

GUS:
The suspect could be holding Chief Vick's baby.

SHAWN:
Or we could make Chief Vick very, very angry. You don't want that.

LASSITER:
Nobody wants that. (walks back to the car)

JULIET pats her pockets, searching for a gift. SHAWN and GUS walk towards the house.

INT. VICK'S HOUSE, ENTRY, DAY

There is a knock on the door and VICK opens it to reveal SHAWN, GUS, JULIET and LASSITER.

LASSITER:
Probably should've given you this sooner, but, uh, happy baby gift. (holds up The Club)

VICK:
Uh, thank you. (takes "gift" as LASSITER enters)

JULIET:
It's a mini rattle and also a low calorie breath freshener. (hands VICK a pack of Tic-Tacs on her way inside)

VICK:
Oh, great. Is there anything I can do for you guys?

GUS:
We just wanted to say hi. (gives VICK a stuffed bunny as he goes inside)

SHAWN holds up a pineapple with a bow on it. He taps it before handing it to VICK.

VICK:
Oh, uh, Shawn, I'm glad that you're here. (closes door) I just wanted to apologize for snapping at you the other day.

INT. VICK'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

LASSITER, JULIET and GUS look around in the living room.

INT. VICK'S HOUSE, ENTRY, DAY

SHAWN:
Chief, there's no need. Really.

SHAWN and VICK slowly walk towards the living room.

VICK:
Oh, well, you know, I was just so mad, I just wanted to strangle you. But I admit I was wrong. I realized I was overreacting after I tried to run my husband over after he left the garage door open. But this agency that you and Gus found...

INT. VICK'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and VICK arrive in the room.

SHAWN:
Yeah, about...

SHAWN ducks away as HITCHCOCK approaches.

HITCHCOCK:
Mrs. Vick!

VICK:
Yeah?

HITCHCOCK:
I just finished up installing the cameras.

SHAWN stands by GUS, his back to the others. He looks up and sees the camera. DANIELS comes down the stairs and stands by HITCHCOCK.

DANIELS:
Guess who just fell asleep?

VICK:
Iris is sleeping?

DANIELS:
Like a lamb.

VICK:
Please tell me that your other nannies are as good with children as you are.

DANIELS:
Even better.

VICK:
(turns to SHAWN and GUS) You guys did a great job.

SHAWN turns around and raises his hands as if to explain.

GUS:
Yeah. About that...

DANIELS steps forward as she sees SHAWN and JULIET.

DANIELS:
Mr. and Mrs. Tostig. I didn't realize you knew Mrs. Vick.

SHAWN:
(shushes with a finger to his mouth and whispers) Mr. Softy would like to say a few words. (heads to the mantel)

VICK:
(whispers) Oh, Shawn, I really don't think that this is the time.

SHAWN picks up a stuffed rabbit from the mantel and holds it to his ear as if listening.

DANIELS:
(to VICK) I thought his name was Levon.

SHAWN:
What's that? The bear snores really loud, he's pretty sure the turtle's really an alien, and all the monkey wants to do is play pull my finger. Oh and somebody just put in some video cameras?

HITCHCOCK:
Yeah, I just set up a bunch of them. So?

SHAWN:
Well, they're not normal video cameras. They're all high-techie with army-grade resolution. What? What's that, fella? Look up? (looks up) That's just a fan, silly. (turns the rabbit so it's looking at the camera before he looks) Oh. Lassie, what's that?

LASSITER:
(steps on a piece of furniture and studies camera) This is the Extella 5400.

DANIELS:
They're the baby bonding cameras, so you can check in. (puts a comforting hand on VICK)

LASSITER:
The Extella 5400 retails for over $10,000. (steps down and winces) Ow! (SHAWN and JULIET reach out) I'm fine.

SHAWN:
I'm seeing angles and pivots and divots. Well, no divots. But it sure is fun to say those back-to-back. Pivots and divots and pivots and divots and pivots and divots and...

GUS:
(smacks SHAWN) Shawn!

SHAWN:
Who wants to give that a shot?

JULIET:
Give what a shot?

SHAWN:
Shots. That's it. Exactly. But I don't see any shots of nannies playing with babies. In fact, there's no babies at all. I'm seeing jewelry boxes and safes and entrances and exits and security keypads. But... But from where? (moves the rabbit so it looks out the window) From the houses next door.

DANIELS:
What are you talking about?

Iris' cries come over the monitor.

GUS:
(shushes and whispers) There's a baby sleeping.

SHAWN:
(hands GUS the rabbit and walks forward) I'm talking about... (steps on a toy that squeaks and when he steps back, he lands on another)

GUS:
(hushing) Shawn, stop it!

JULIET shushes.

SHAWN:
Well, it's like a mine field!

DANIELS sighs as SHAWN clears his throat and starts again.

SHAWN:
(whispers) I'm talking about casing out houses next door to the ones your nannies work at. I'm talking about a string of robberies, one of which went terribly wrong when all of a sudden your witness-less crime got witnessed. And then it became murder.

DANIELS:
(whispers) That ridiculous.

We see flashbacks as SHAWN explains.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Is it as ridiculous as having a secret panel in your office where you can plan all your robberies? You had access to each and every one of those baby bonding cameras, and you manipulated them. Not to check on any nannies, but to case the houses next door to capture security alarm codes so you could break into those houses undetected. I'd say that's pretty ridiculous. Though not as ridiculous as Denise Richards playing a nuclear physicist named Christmas Jones in a Bond movie. But still.

HITCHCOCK:
Look, I don't know what this guy's deal is, but we gotta go.

VICK:
(whispers) This guy's deal is that he's a psychic.

GUS:
(whispers) Who happens to work for the police.

DANIELS:
(whispers) Oh, really?

VICK:
(whispers) Yeah, really. The Santa Barbara Police Department, which I'm the chief of.

VICK nods her head and LASSITER and JULIET take out their handcuffs as they walk over to DANIELS and HITCHCOCK. SHAWN and GUS fist bump with Mr. Softy.

LASSITER:
(to HITCHCOCK) Anybody ever tell you you look like a puffer fish?

IRIS starts crying. LASSITER winces as he looks over at VICK.

LASSITER:
Sorry.

EXT. PARK, DAY

SHAWN and GUS cross the park near the playground. SHAWN has another box of jelly beans.

GUS:
I can't believe it all worked out.

SHAWN:
I know. All I had to do was get the fruit bowl assortment from Garrett Bell's Jelly Bean factory and every flavor's delicious.

GUS:
I'm talking about with chief Vick. Her nephew's transferring to a nursing school in Santa Barbara. In two weeks, she'll have her old nanny back.

SHAWN:
Mm, pomegranate.

GUS:
I wonder what she's going to do in the meantime.

SHAWN:
Oh, I took care of that.

GUS:
You mean, after I scoured the city and couldn't find anyone, you just stumbled upon a nanny responsible enough for Chief Vick?

SHAWN:
(sighs) That I did.

SHAWN and GUS stop and look over to a bench where HENRY is with Iris and the two are surrounded by other nannies. HENRY seems to be acting like a doting grandfather.

HENRY:
Give me a little whoop. Whoop.

HENRY lifts Iris' top and looks down.

SHAWN:
And you gotta admit, the man knows how to work a baby.

NANNY 1:
Cute!

NANNY 2:
Good hand support!

HENRY sees SHAWN and GUS.

HENRY:
Shawn!

SHAWN and GUS turn and hurry away.

SHAWN:
Don't look back. Just keep walking.

HENRY:
Shawn! Shawn! Where are you going? Come on, you said five minutes! Don't you dare leave! I'm smelling something really foul coming out of this thing!

Episode 2x9 Bounty Hunters!

1987

EXT. SBPD, DAY

A classic Plymouth convertible pulls up in front of the building where SHAWN and GUS are eating ice cream cones. The driver steps out and walks around to the passenger side. He is wearing black jeans, a white T-shirt and a black leather vest. Around his neck is a cord, attached to which is a badge. He pulls the cuffed man out of the passenger door and pushes him towards the building.

GUS:
Who is that?

SHAWN:
Maybe only the coolest guy ever.

They watch as the man passes them as he heads up the stairs. He winks in their direction. HENRY passes him on the way down.

HENRY:
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late. Had to do a little extra paperwork. Let's hit it.

GUS and SHAWN stand up.

SHAWN:
Sorry, Dad, we were just checking out that super-cop.

HENRY:
(takes off sunglasses) Shawn, that is not a super-cop. That guy is a bounty hunter.

SHAWN:
What's that, a cop with a cooler name?

HENRY:
He's not cool, Shawn. He's a nuisance. He's a privately hired half criminal operating outside the law.

SHAWN imagines himself in the bounty hunter's place.

HENRY:
Shawn, look at me. Shawn. He's not about justice, he's about the money.

SHAWN:
But they look cool, right?

HENRY:
(bends over) All right, listen to me, son. If you want to arrest somebody, you do it the right way. You do it with a badge. You got it? Let's hit it.

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER is leading a major briefing for the entire department using a screen and slideshow.

LASSITER:
All right, everybody, listen up, listen up! Take a close look at this picture. His name is Dwayne Tancana. 12 counts of grand larceny on his sheet. Just did 36 months on his last beef. But he's upped his game recently when he was charged with the murder of Isabella Cole. Found dead after a robbery invasion at her home. He was supposed to be arraigned this morning, but he managed to escape police custody. He's on the run and considered armed and dangerous.

A young OFFICER standing next to JULIET raises her hand.

Episode 3x01 Ghosts

Previously on "PSYCH"...

We see clips of the tail end of last season, ending with SHAWN opening the door and saying "Mom".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1995

EXT. ISOLATED ROAD, NIGHT

A car slowly pulls up and we see HENRY - a detective at this point - and his partner, RAY, in the front seat. HENRY looks out the driver's side window as he puts the car in park. There is another car in park up the way, engine off. The windows appear steamed up.

HENRY:
(into radio) Dispatch, we've located the stolen vehicle. Occupants inside. Approaching now.

DISPATCH:
(over radio) 10-4. Proceed with caution.

RAY:
Henry. You don't want to do this.

HENRY:
I don't have a choice, Ray.

RAY:
Think of the consequences.

HENRY:
We're way past consequences. This needs to end tonight.

HENRY gets out and approaches the other car, opens the front door and shines his flashlight inside. The couple inside squints at the light in their eyes. The driver is SHAWN, in the midst of his Judd Nelson phase.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Whoops.

HENRY:
Whoops?

GIRL:
It's my neighbor's car. We were gonna put it back. It was just a dare.

SHAWN:
Is there a problem here, Officer?

HENRY:
You wanted my attention, Shawn, you got it, buddy.

GIRL:
Wait, you guys know each other?

SHAWN:
Yeah, he's sort of my dad.

INT. SBPD, HALL

HENRY has his hand on a hand-cuffed SHAWN'S arm as he marches them into the station.

SHAWN:
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask for that "Worid's Greatest Dad" mug back.

HENRY:
You just keep talking, Shawn.

SHAWN:
You keep talking.

HENRY:
Oh, don't worry, I will. Like when I read you your rights.

SHAWN:
Ooh, I have rights. That'll be new and fun.

HENRY:
(stops and yanks SHAWN around to face him) What am I gonna tell your mother?

SHAWN:
I don't know. You think you can get a hold of her new phone number?

HENRY:
I hope it was worth it, smart-ass. This officially ends your chance of being a cop.

SHAWN:
Let's be honest. I gave up wanting to be like you a long time ago.

HENRY:
That's it! Somebody book him! You, beanpole! Get over here. Fingerprint him now!

The beanpole is a young rookie LASSITER with a mustache.

LASSITER:
Oh, I'm so--I'm sorry. (looks around) Me?

SHAWN scoffs.

HENRY:
Never mind, rookie. I'll do it myself.

HENRY pulls SHAWN away as LASSITER reaches for his cuffs.

PRESENT DAY

INT. CENTRAL COAST, GUS' OFFICE, DAY

GUS is looking through a pamphlet when his phone rings. He answers it.

GUS:
Burton Guster.

SHAWN:
(over phone) Dude, I'm freaking out. You have to help me.

GUS:
What's wrong?

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. HENRY'S, SHAWN'S ROOM, DAY

SHAWN is in his childhood bedroom sitting on the bed.

SHAWN:
My mom's here.

GUS:
She's back in the country?

SHAWN:
Back in the country? Try--try back in this city. Try downstairs in my dad's kitchen.

GUS:
Where are you?

SHAWN:
Hiding out in my bedroom. (opens drawer of nightstand) Oh, my God! Holy crap. I just found an entire unopened box of Shrinky Dinks.

GUS:
You're hiding in your bedroom because your mom came to visit? Dude, you've got problems.

SHAWN:
Are you hearing what I'm saying? My mom is standing downstairs in my dad's kitchen laughing it up, having a grand old time. You don't think that's a little weird?

GUS:
And you're unhappy she's here?

SHAWN:
No, I'm not unhappy she's here... I don't know. I haven't seen her in three years. She used to tell me everything.

GUS:
What is she doing here?

SHAWN:
Working.

GUS:
For the police department?

SHAWN:
I guess. I don't know. (tries to get comfortable on the bed) I haven't found out much because, apparently, it's 1988 in my house and no one felt the need to tell me anything. But I know my dad is behind all of this... (reaches under the pillows and pulls out a toy) Oh, my God! Dude, did you know I had a Furby?

GUS:
Shawn, I have no time for this. I've got my own problems. I have to go see Frankjim Ogletree.

SHAWN:
Frankjim Ogletree? Is that a person or a hippopotamus?

GUS:
He's the new Regional Sales Manager. My immediate boss. And a tyrant. They call him the little Pinochet.

SHAWN:
That's too abstract. Why don't they just call him Jerk Pants or Suck McJones?

GUS:
They're MIT guys, Shawn. Now go face your parents. You've been wanting to see your mom forever. And tell her I'm coming by for some Jell-O cake.

SHAWN:
Holy... Dude! I just found a pristine issue of Dynamite magazine withSquare Pegs on the cover. Hold on, I'm gonna read "Bummers" to you.

GUS hangs up.

INT. HENRY'S, KITCHEN, DAY

SHAWN slowly comes down the stairs. HENRY and MADDIE are in the kitchen preparing cheese and crackers. HENRY opens a bottle of wine.

MADDIE:
The cheese knife is in the same place, right?

HENRY:
Yeah, it's right there. You want me to give you a hand, hon?

MADDIE:
(turns around) Did you just call me "honey"?

HENRY:
I did not. I was going to say "hunchback".

MADDIE:
Oh, Shawny, look at this. Not only does your father own a very expensive bottle of Bordeaux, he hand-made little cucumber sandwiches. Do you believe that?

HENRY pours a glass of wine.

SHAWN:
Wow, he is just chock full of surprises today.

HENRY:
What? I'm allowed to expand my horizons, right?

SHAWN takes the wine and gulps it down.

SHAWN:
I'm so glad to see you, Mom. What are you doing in town?

MADDIE:
Well, some police departments occasionally call me up to come back and do psych evaluations.

SHAWN:
How long have you known about this?

MADDIE:
Not long. I almost didn't do it. I changed my mind at the last second. I'm doing Santa Barbara PD, a few in San Diego, the Bay area. When are our dinner reservations, Henry?

SHAWN:
Oh, there's dinner plans tonight?

HENRY:
You can make it, right?

MADDIE:
Of course he can make it.

SHAWN:
Of course I will come. I just... Need to cancel a date but that is not a big deal.

MADDIE:
You made other plans?

SHAWN:
I didn't make other plans. I-- I didn't know.

MADDIE:
Didn't know what?

SHAWN:
That you were coming.

MADDIE:
Henry, why didn't you tell him I was coming?

HENRY:
He doesn't have a phone.

MADDIE:
You don't have a phone?

SHAWN:
I do.

MADDIE:
Are you having money problems? Henry, why don't you buy him a phone?

SHAWN:
Mom, I'm fine. I'm not having money problems. I'm-- I dropped my phone while I was solving a very important crime. It was on the front page of the newspaper yesterday. Yeah. (to HENRY) May I speak with you privately?

SHAWN and HENRY walk out to the living room.

INT. HENRY'S, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk to the far side of the room.

SHAWN:
(angry whisper) What the hell is going on in there?

HENRY:
I tried to tell you, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Allow me to demonstrate trying. "Shawn, guess who's coming back into the country on Friday? Your mother." That's it. Mission accomplished.

HENRY:
Look, I wanted to clear the air on a few things before she got here.

SHAWN:
Clear the air? You think you can undo 15 years of hard feelings with a bottle of... Pinot...

HENRY:
Bordeaux.

SHAWN:
I didn't even know Wal-Mart had a wine cellar.

HENRY:
Look, would you give me a break? I'm just trying to make a nice night for her here.

SHAWN:
You're sabotaging me.

HENRY:
Why would I do that?

SHAWN:
I don't know. But I'm gonna figure it out. (leaves)

INT. CENTRAL COAST, OGLETREE'S OFFICE, DAY

OGLETREE is putting when there is a knock on the door and GUS enters.

GUS:
You wanted to see me, Mr. Ogletree?

OGLETREE:
Shut the door, Burton.

OGLETREE puts the golf club away as GUS closes the door.

OGLETREE:
I was reading the paper yesterday and something caught my attention. (tosses paper on the table and there is a picture of GUS and SHAWN after solving the case at the museum) Have to say I was surprised considering you seem to already have a full-time job. (sits at desk)

GUS:
(walks forward) This is just something I do on the side. (sits) A hobby, really, like collecting thimbles or, um, raising carrier pigeons.

OGLETREE:
You raise carrier pigeons?

GUS:
No. Not at all. That's totally lame. I just said that because I was flustered.

OGLETREE:
I raise carrier pigeons.

GUS:
I'm glad you said that, because I was afraid to tell you how cool I thought carrier pigeons are. Flying around and carrying stuff. Coming back. Awesome, I hear that.

OGLETREE:
Are you familiar with the exclusivity clause in your contract? It means we don't allow second jobs.

GUS:
Jobs? No, no. Psych is more like community service. And it never affects my work.

OGLETREE:
This photo was taken Thursday night. I notice that you signed out early that day.

GUS:
I think the important thing is I signed out.

OGLETREE:
Let's roll back the clock, shall we? (reads file) Monday, the 28th, you had three appointments. You missed all of them. Tuesday, the 29th, you disappeared after lunch. And, Wednesday, well, here you are. You did your entire week's work in one afternoon.

GUS:
It was a crazy week.

OGLETREE:
Seems to me you had a crazy year. I have taken the liberty of preparing this for you. (slides a piece of paper across the desk)

GUS:
(picks up paper) What is this?

OGLETREE:
It's a termination notice. Or you could quit your other job. You tell me.

GUS passes the letter back to OGLETREE.

OGLETREE:
Good choice!

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and MADDIE walk through the station.

MADDIE:
Shawn, you don't have to walk me through the whole building. I used to do quite a few sessions here. This is where I met your father.

SHAWN:
I know. I heard the story. He did his evaluation after he shot some drug dealer.

MADDIE:
He told you that? He twisted his ankle doing security for the Cinnamon Festival. I had to clear him for duty.

SHAWN:
(scoffs) Figures, that's about par.

MADDIE:
What happened? He said the two of you were getting along better.

SHAWN:
Mom, the last thing I wanna do right now is talk about Henry.

MADDIE:
Okay, that's fair. Let's talk about you. (stops) Who is that date you had to cancel on Friday?

SHAWN:
(stops and turns to face MADDIE) Ah, it was just some girl I met. She's a museum curator. It's not a big deal, Mom. I doubt it would have worked out anyway.

MADDIE:
How many dates?

SHAWN:
That would have been the first.

MADDIE:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
Mom.

MADDIE:
Come on, Goose. Whenever we talk, you're always about to not go on a second date with somebody new.

SHAWN:
I happen to be excellent at first dates. You know who is having multiple dates? Dad. I believe he's up to number eight with his Jekyll and Hyde English girlfriend.

MADDIE:
You guys should connect more often. He told me they broke it off a few weeks ago. We're talking about him again.

SHAWN:
Yes, we are. Let's stop. I should let you go. (kisses MADDIE on the cheek) How many of these do you have to do, anyway?

MADDIE:
Oh, three uniforms and a detective.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

LASSITER is standing in front of VICK'S desk, holding her glass fish, when VICK enters.

LASSITER:
Oh, you, uh, you wanted to see me, Chief?

VICK:
Yes. (walks around to her chair) It has come to my attention, Detective, that you've discharged your weapons in the last four cases you've worked.

LASSITER:
Thank you.

VICK:
That wasn't a compliment.

LASSITER:
I'm just trying to keep the streets safe, Chief.

VICK:
(crosses arms) The last incident was at a cat show.

LASSITER:
Well, let me just go on record as saying that I would never shoot a cat.

VICK:
(sits) I guess I could find some solace in that.

LASSITER:
Unless it was approaching in a threatening manner, or refused to stop upon my command. I would probably just fire a warning shot to make my point, but it's really a field decision. I can't commit to it at this juncture. (crosses arms)

VICK:
(sighs) I've requested a department-sanctioned psychologist to come here and have a session or two with you.

LASSITER:
I'm just gonna have to say no.

VICK:
That wasn't a question.

LASSITER:
Could you phrase it like one?

INT. CENTRAL COAST, ATRIUM, DAY

GUS walks towards the center of the atrium. He passes the small group at the water cooler, greeting them by name. One of them is SHAWN and he's eating pasta.

GUS:
Hey, Katie. Kathy. Shawn. (turns around) Shawn? (grabs SHAWN by the arm and pulls him away) What the hell are you doing here?

SHAWN:
I should ask you the same question.

GUS:
I work here.

SHAWN:
(sets down pasta) Okay, I should ask you a different question. Why didn't you return my calls all weekend?

GUS:
Shawn, I had no other choice about all of this.

SHAWN:
Oh, my God. This isn't a joke. You're really quitting Psych?

GUS:
I'm so sorry, Shawn.

SHAWN:
In a text message, no less?

GUS:
I couldn't think of any other way to tell you. I knew you would just try to convince me to stay. Listen, maybe we could still do it on the weekends.

SHAWN:
If you're ready to hear some good news, I have worked out a compromise that will solve all of this.

GUS:
Really?

SHAWN:
Yes. You quit this job. This job you quit! We take on extra cases to make up the difference in salary.

GUS:
I make 48 grand a year, Shawn.

SHAWN:
What is that? Yen? Who needs $48,000 to live?

GUS:
I need 32. The other 16 generally goes to you.

SHAWN:
Don't be ridiculous.

GUS:
I claimed you on my taxes, Shawn! Holy crap. (sees pasta and picks up bowl) Is this Bianca's pappardelle?

SHAWN:
Mmm-hmm, I found it in the kitchen fridge.

GUS:
Oh, my gosh, she's gonna go insane. She hand rolls her pasta every weekend, Shawn. They take all day. She grinds her own spices, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Well, I thought it was for everybody.

GUS:
(sees a woman approaching) Crap! (hides pasta bowl inside copier drawer)

BIANCA:
Burton?

GUS:
Bianca.

BIANCA:
Paul would like to see you.

GUS:
Mr. Haversham? Really? Lovely. I'll be there in a second.

BIANCA:
Okay. (walks away)

SHAWN and GUS watch her leave.

SHAWN:
What does she do?

GUS:
She's Haversham's secretary.

SHAWN:
Is Haversham the guy who tried to fire you?

GUS:
No, he's that guy's boss. Everybody's boss. He's the VP.

SHAWN:
Perfect. He's the one we have to convince to let you keep doing both jobs.

GUS:
But...

SHAWN:
I need a second. I'm gonna clean my teeth before we go in.

GUS:
No, no, no, Shawn. You're leaving now.

SHAWN:
Gus, I'm not budging until we make this nice.

GUS:
(unbuttons jacket) All right, but you asked for it.

SHAWN:
(looks GUS up and down) Asked for what?

GUS wraps his arms around SHAWN'S waist and tries to lift him.

SHAWN:
Let go of me!

SHAWN tries to get some leverage, even grabbing at the water fountain as they pass. When that doesn't work, he simply goes limp.

GUS:
Don't you dare go boneless on me, Shawn! (starts to lose grip on SHAWN) Okay! (reaches a hand to his back) Lower back.

SHAWN:
(stands in concern) You see? That's why it's not...

GUS tries again.

SHAWN:
Oh! You son of a bitch!

As GUS carries and pushes SHAWN down the corridor, SHAWN grabs for the railing. He finally lies face-down on the floor, forcing GUS to drag him.

INT. CENTRAL COAST, HAVERSHAM'S OFFICE, DAY

HAVERSHAM lowers the newspaper he was reading to see a disheveled GUS.

GUS:
You wanted to see me?

HAVERSHAM:
Yes, I did. I have a project for you. Have a seat.

GUS:
(sees a picture of HAVERSHAM and an older woman on his desk) Is that your wife?

HAVERSHAM:
It's my grandmother.

GUS:
Tell her I said she's lovely.

HAVERSHAM:
She died.

GUS:
I'm going to sit down now. (sits)

HAVERSHAM:
Lots of talk about this in the office. (tosses newspaper onto desk)

GUS:
(straightens collar and tie) Yes, sir, I'm aware of that and I've already taken care of it.

HAVERSHAM:
I don't think you have. When my wife and I moved into our house, we were met with a series of unexplained disturbances. Perhaps fueled by my wife's predilection for the supernatural. Well, after a while, it stopped. But recently, these occurrences have returned. To the point where my wife is staying with her mother.

GUS:
Mr. Haversham, why are you telling me this?

HAVERSHAM:
Because I believe my wife believes our house is haunted. And I would like to hire you.

At that moment, SHAWN enters the room, lowering an empty glass from his ear.

SHAWN:
Gus, I had a strange feeling I was need. (pretends to sip from the empty glass)

GUS looks nervously at HAVERSHAM.

INT. CENTRAL COAST, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk down the hall. GUS is holding a folder.

SHAWN:
Cool, eh? Looks like word getting out about you moonlighting isn't the worst thing in the worid.

GUS:
Let's be clear. Haversham is the most powerful man in this office. He's gonna be running this company sometime soon. Give the man the respect he deserves. (hands SHAWN a paper from the folder)

SHAWN:
What is this?

GUS:
His company bio. Learn it.

SHAWN:
(reads) "Bred for Success"?

GUS:
His father is William Haversham, genius entrepreneur. This guy grew up under the tutelage of a business master and real estate magnate.

SHAWN:
I know him. He's the one that built the Poliodome.

GUS:
Polodome.

They exit the building.

EXT. CENTRAL COAST, DAY

SHAWN:
That's a much less depressing name. Shouldn't we go?

GUS:
No. Meet me at Haversham's at 7:00.

SHAWN:
I think I can handle that.

GUS:
And no whimpering. And no screaming. No running from anything. I don't care how spooky his old house is. Haversham thinks my nickname is Fearless Guster.

SHAWN walks away.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

LASSITER is sitting tensely on the couch, arms crossed. MADDIE is sitting in a nearby armchair, relaxed.

LASSITER:
Well, do you want to start some sort of recording device?

MADDIE:
No, I don't record my sessions. I prefer just to talk.

LASSITER:
How do you remember the important things?

MADDIE:
You've heard of a photographic memory? Well, I have a bit of... I guess you'd call it an eidetic tonal memory.

LASSITER:
So you'll remember everything I've said?

MADDIE:
Pretty much, yes. Would you like to start?

LASSITER:
Yes. First question: where's the bug?

MADDIE:
The what?

LASSITER:
The bug. (looks around and checks under the table) Nothing new in this area. Must be concealed on your person.

MADDIE:
I honestly don't have anything on me.

LASSITER:
Then you wouldn't be opposed to me patting you down.

MADDIE:
Actually, I'm very opposed to that.

LASSITER:
Would you be willing to submit to a polygraph?

EXT. HAVERSHAM'S, NIGHT

GUS pulls into the driveway. HAVERSHAM'S house is large and well-lit.

INT. ECHO, NIGHT

GUS puts the car in park and takes out his phone to dial SHAWN.

GUS:
Shawn, don't do this to me. You're late. At this moment, you are officially late! (sees a shadow at an upstairs window) Just call me when you get here. (ends call)

GUS exhales and gets out of the car.

EXT. HAVERSHAM'S, NIGHT

GUS slowly walks up to the front door. He knocks and the doors open with a creak. GUS enters nervously.

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, HALL, NIGHT

GUS cautiously peers around the corner.

GUS:
Hello?

GUS walks slowly down the hall. Behind him, a figure in white crosses the hall. GUS turns but misses the figure.

GUS:
Is somebody there? (voice squeaks at the end)

GUS heads back the way he came.

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, MASTER BEDROOM, NIGHT

GUS enters slowly. There are candles lit and a lamp on the bedside table. As GUS goes deeper into the room, the hooded figure comes up behind him. It lowers the hood and we see it is SHAWN. He blows air at the back of GUS' head. GUS gasps as he ducks.

SHAWN:
I just heard you squeak. (he is wearing HAVERSHAM'S silk robe)

GUS:
Damn you, Shawn. I thought you were a ghost from outside.

SHAWN:
And yet you still came in, all by your lonesome. Fearless Guster impresses. (heads for the bed)

GUS:
How did you get inside the house?

SHAWN:
Hadewych, the housekeeper. She was leaving, so she let me in. Tiny little dollop of a woman, Dutch-Indonesian. Enormous forearms. She made me a pannekoek. It's like a pancake but it is the size of a manhole cover. (lies on the bed)

GUS:
Are you wearing Haversham's robe?

SHAWN:
Yep. You should try it. The worm that spins this silk is extinct. You can't find these.

GUS:
Take it off.

SHAWN:
I can't.

In the distance, we hear a door open.

HAVERSHAM:
(calls) Hello?

GUS:
Where are your clothes?

SHAWN:
In the dryer.

GUS:
In the dryer?

SHAWN:
Well, the sauna was a little bit hotter than I was expecting.

GUS grabs him and pulls him off the bed.

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, KITCHEN, NIGHT

HAVERSHAM is pouring hot cocoa from a white china teapot. SHAWN and GUS enter. SHAWN is wearing his clothes over the robe.

GUS:
Mr. Haversham, we got here early.

SHAWN:
(shakes HAVERSHAM'S hand) Hadewych let us in. We love her, and we'd like one of our own.

HAVERSHAM:
(sees what SHAWN is wearing) Is that an ascot?

SHAWN:
Yes. Yes, it is.

HAVERSHAM:
I like it. It's a classic accoutrement. It's nice to see someone with a sense of tradition.

SHAWN:
Gus and I are both huge fans of the classics. To be completely honest I'm surprised he isn't wearing his spats this evening. Can we see the epicenter of the ghoulish activity?

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, STUDY, NIGHT

HAVERSHAM leads SHAWN and GUS into his study.

HAVERSHAM:
Please don't touch anything.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, Mr. Haversham, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to touch absolutely everything. Including this naked lady lamp. (presses finger against lamp) I also might have to sniff some stuff. Possibly lick some things. These Tootsie Roll Pops come to mind. (picks up a pop and hands it to GUS who puts it back) Are you a skeptic, sir?

HAVERSHAM:
Elaine's the real believer so I guess you could say that.

SHAWN:
Just as I thought. Please leave.

HAVERSHAM:
What?

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, sir. You are a skeptic. Therefore, you must wait in the hall, preferably at the end. You're killing all of my jujubes.

HAVERSHAM:
(scoffs and heads for the door) Jujubes are candies.

SHAWN:
Exactly.

HAVERSHAM leaves. SHAWN begins to explore the room.

GUS:
You better take off that robe.

SHAWN:
(sits in an easy chair by the fireplace) I will.

GUS:
And I know what you're trying to do.

SHAWN:
What, innocently flip through a photo album?

GUS:
No, you're sabotaging this on purpose.

SHAWN sees HAVERSHAM'S graduation picture with his grandmother. She has her arm around him and SHAWN notices the large ring on her finger.

SHAWN:
Why would I do that?

GUS:
To get me fired so I have no other choice but to go back Psych.

SHAWN then sees pictures from HAVERSHAM'S engagement party. His grandmother looks on proudly.

SHAWN:
That's actually an ingenious plan. But that's not how I play, Gus. I play fair, and I roll hard. I'm gonna find this man's ghost, and I will rid him of it. (closes album and picks up a framed photo) Did Haversham have any enemies?

The framed photo is from the wedding toast. The wife is not wearing his grandmother's ring.

GUS:
Not really. Corporate thinks he's a magician. He completely revamped our inventory system.

SHAWN:
Really? Whole system, from A to Z, including M? All the vowels? This guy sounds like a real maverick.

SHAWN checks the list of incoming calls on the phone. One is "B. Takahamo". There are lots of doctors on the list as well.

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, KITCHEN, NIGHT

HAVERSHAM is having his cocoa and reading the paper. A German Shepherd lies on a rug in the corner. SHAWN and GUS enter. SHAWN is no longer wearing the robe.

GUS:
Mr. Haversham, allow me to say this is my most valuable work experience yet.

HAVERSHAM:
(stands) Well. Allow me to say that I'm not impressed.

GUS:
Duly noted.

The dog whines and then starts barking. The three men look at it.

SHAWN:
Whoa!

HAVERSHAM:
Magnum! Quiet, boy! Stop that! Quiet, boy! (goes over to Magnum who seems to be barking at the walls)

GUS:
What is he barking at?

HAVERSHAM:
I don't know. He never barks. (takes the dog by the collar) Come on, boy. Come on. Come on, that's it. Here we go. (takes Magnum out of the room)

SHAWN:
(turns to GUS) Dude, look at you. You were cool as a cucumber while that went down. Fearless Guster's a badass. Let's check the basement.

GUS:
I can't.

SHAWN:
Why not?

GUS:
My feet won't move.

INT. SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

LASSITER exits VICK'S office and JULIET hurries over to meet him.

JULIET:
So how did it go?

LASSITER:
I'm winning.

JULIET:
How are you winning?

LASSITER:
I answered every question in character as Tom "Gunny" Highway.

JULIET:
Who is Tom "Gunny" Highway?

LASSITER:
Clint Eastwood's character in Heartbreak Ridge?

JULIET:
(groan) It's not a contest, Carlton.

LASSITER:
(puts a hand on her arm) Don't kid yourself, O'Hara, you'll only come out losing. (walks away)

JULIET:
Losing what?

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS make their way to the basement.

GUS:
Why are we going to the basement?

SHAWN:
Because, Gus, that's where ghosts do their thing. It's cold and dark and dusty.

SHAWN and GUS start down the stairs.

HAVERSHAM:
Excuse me. Can I help you two? (he's holding a china cup)

SHAWN:
Yeah, we're just gonna check out the basement.

HAVERSHAM:
We don't go to the basement.

GUS:
He doesn't go to the basement.

SHAWN:
Why is that?

HAVERSHAM:
Mold spores. My wife had some workers here. You can get to the door, but you can't get in, 'cause it's bolted shut.

SHAWN:
I still think it's probably worth... (sniffs) Is that hot chocolate?

HAVERSHAM:
It's Dutch cocoa. Hadewych makes a pot for me each night before she leaves.

SHAWN:
I see. Mr. Haversham, in order to fully understand the connection that you have with this ghost, I will need to see what you see, wear what you wear, drink what you drink.

HAVERSHAM:
You're saying you'd like some hot chocolate.

SHAWN:
Yes. With marshmallows, please.

HAVERSHAM:
Right.

GUS knocks his shoulder into SHAWN'S before following HAVERSHAM.

SHAWN:
What? It's Dutch.

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, STUDY, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are sipping cocoa.

SHAWN:
Tastes like it was dipped straight out of Willy Wonka's river.

GUS:
Would you get serious?

SHAWN:
Well, he's not the most gracious host, you know. If he'd just offered, I wouldn't have had to ask. And that pannekoek, not nearly as filling as it may have seemed.

SHAWN looks through the window behind GUS, mouth open, the cocoa spills to the floor.

GUS:
(rights the cup) You're getting hot chocolate on the floor!

Still staring out the window, SHAWN puts the cup down. GUS turns around to see what he's looking at. They peer through the blinds. Outside, a figure dressed in a white gown and holding a lamp crosses the lawn.

SHAWN:
Did you see that?

GUS drops his cocoa. HAVERSHAM hurries down the stairs and over to the window.

HAVERSHAM:
What the hell is... (sees the figure)

As the three of them stare out the window as the figure passes the other way, Magnum jumps up onto the window, barking.

HAVERSHAM:
Magnum! Down, boy!

SHAWN:
(whispers) That dog is kind of an "A" hole.

GUS:
(whispers) It sees something.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Yeah. Urine stains on my pants.

HAVERSHAM:
So, what do we do now?

SHAWN:
I think we stay here. We close the blinds, we lock the doors, we call it a night. (to GUS) Del Taco? (to HAVERSHAM) Del Taco?

GUS:
No, not me. I'm going out there. (turns)

SHAWN:
(grabs GUS' arm) Are you kidding me?

GUS:
Shawn, this is what we do.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Yeah, but there's a ghost out there, so would you cut the...

GUS:
We need to do this...

SHAWN:
Okay, fine. (to HAVERSHAM) Do you have high-end, energy-efficient xenon flashlights?

EXT. HAVERSHAM'S, GROUNDS, NIGHT

GUS and SHAWN runs across the grounds following the figure. They come to a stop, panting.

SHAWN:
Pardon me for saying so, but Fearless Guster sucks.

GUS:
I don't care what you say, we're solving this case. So suck it up.

SHAWN:
Suck what up?

GUS:
What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
What are you talking about?

GUS:
I don't know. You got my mind all messed up.

SHAWN:
(motions to the right) I'm going that direction.

GUS:
(motions to the left) She went that way.

SHAWN:
Good luck. (runs off)

GUS:
What--

GUS nervously turns in a slow circle. A beam of light approaches from the direction they came. It is HAVERSHAM.

HAVERSHAM:
Hey, it's me. Not letting you do this alone. (looks around) Where is he?

GUS shushes him.

SHAWN:
(shouts from off-screen) I got her!

GUS and HAVERSHAM run over to SHAWN. They stop, stunned.

GUS:
What do you mean you got her?

SHAWN groans as he fights yards of material. He stands to find he only has a white gown.

GUS:
What is going on here?

SHAWN:
(panting) I don't know.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

LASSITER and MADDIE are in the same positions as they day before.

MADDIE:
I realized something. Yesterday, with all that talk about weapons, I neglected to ask you a very important question. What kind of gun do you carry?

LASSITER:
Would you like to see it?

MADDIE:
I would love to.

LASSITER:
(smiles, leans forward and takes his gun from its holster) Picked this up with a little extra cash after I decided not to go with a divorce attorney. (takes out magazine and shows off gun)

MADDIE:
You're going through a separation?

LASSITER:
Well, yeah. Yeah, it's... She went with one of these high-powered ambulance chasers but, uh, that's just her insecurities, you know.

MADDIE:
You know who you remind me of?

LASSITER:
Who?

MADDIE:
Did you ever see that movie Heartbreak Ridge?

LASSITER doesn't know what to say.

EXT. HAVERSHAM'S, DAY

SHAWN opens a window to the basement and peers in. All he can see is a storage space with boxes and crates. GUS, standing beside him, knocks on the window pane.

GUS:
Mold spores, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Well, I'm attracted to places I'm not allowed to go.

GUS:
Good luck with your stachybotros virus.

SHAWN:
(stands) Listen, man, we need to wrap this up quickly. I have dinner plans with my mom tonight. I've hardly had a chance to see her at all. (vapor comes out of his mouth as he speaks)

GUS:
(stares) Shawn.

HADEWYCH comes outside behind GUS to take out the garbage.

SHAWN:
What? Hadewych!

HADEWYCH drops the garbage in shock as she sees the vapor from SHAWN'S mouth.

SHAWN:
It's okay, I'm Shawn Spencer. It's me and my partner, Lemongrass Gogoloab. Have you noticed anything strange?

HADEWYCH:
Only now.

SHAWN:
We saw a woman in the woods last night that may not have been alive.

HADEWYCH puts her hands up before peering inside the kitchen window. Coast clear, she faces SHAWN.

HADEWYCH:
Saturday, the missus, she leave. Go to mother's, yes? Sunday, I forget my bag, come back. I hear voices, lady voices in the house.

SHAWN:
What did you do?

HADEWYCH:
I leave. Too much strangeness here lately. (goes back inside)

GUS:
Something's off with that woman, Shawn.

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

GUS is sitting on a chair facing SHAWN on the sofa. SHAWN is nervously tapping his fingers and looks at the clock.

SHAWN:
(stands) Okay, nothing's happening. I gotta go.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Gus, we made plans. My dad has been manipulating her time all week.

GUS:
(stands) Shawn, let me be clear. I'm not leaving here until Haversham not only wants me to keep moonlighting at Psych forever but also makes me a partner.

HAVERSHAM comes down the stairs.

SHAWN:
Sorry, buddy. (reaches for his helmet)

HAVERSHAM:
Wai-wait, what's this? Are you leaving?

SHAWN:
Mr. Haversham, it is my belief that we have done all there is to do here tonight.

The lights flicker.

SHAWN:
(continues like nothing happened) Tomorrow, we will look into the history of the house, see if there's anything there that can help us.

More lights flicker. GUS and HAVERSHAM watch them before turning back to SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Just don't have any leads at this point.

All the lights flicker.

SHAWN:
So! I think we should all pat each other on the backs for a job well done so far, reconvene first thing in the morning for a nice farmer's breakfast.

The lights throughout the house flicker.

SHAWN:
I have dinner plans with my mother.

The lights go out.

INT. RESTAURANT, NIGHT

SHAWN enters the restaurant just as MADDIE is walking past.

MADDIE:
(hugs him) Oh, you made it. Oh, I was sure you weren't gonna make it.

SHAWN:
(ends hug) I'm sorry, Ma. You have no idea the day I just had.

MADDIE:
Well, I'm just running to the ladies'. We're right over there. (motions behind her)

SHAWN:
We?

MADDIE:
Oh, your father was lonely and I thought I might have to eat dinner alone, so I let him tag along. That's fine, right?

SHAWN:
You're absolutely certain he's my father?

MADDIE groans and playfully slaps SHAWN on the chest before continuing to the ladies' room. SHAWN smiles as she leaves before looking over to the table where HENRY is. The smile leaves his face and he walks over to the table. HENRY is wearing a suit and tie. He's already eating.

HENRY:
Oh! Hey, Shawn. Grab a menu. We already ordered. I'm sure it's all right.

SHAWN:
All right, what is this?

HENRY:
What is what?

SHAWN:
This. (motions to take in HENRY) What is all of this? The aftershave, the pumiced scalp, the suit.

HENRY:
I can wear a suit.

SHAWN:
Which one of the three tenors did you borrow that from? Not the dead one, I hope.

HENRY:
It's my suit, Shawn. I dress up occasionally. You have a problem with that?

SHAWN:
No. (sits) I have a problem with this pretend Henry that showed up when Mom got to town.

HENRY:
I don't know where you're going with this. (wipes mouth with napkin)

SHAWN:
You're acting like a phony, and you know it, and it's bugging the hell out of me. Look at yourself!

HENRY:
Shawn, I order a braised quail salad and all of a sudden, you think I'm putting on airs?

WAITER:
Excuse me, who here has the guinea hen crostone with the liver pancetta?

HENRY:
(raises hand)That would be me.

SHAWN scoffs as the waiter places the dish on the table in front of HENRY.

HENRY:
(to SHAWN) Everybody here is ordering it.

SHAWN:
Look, I'm, uh... I'm just gonna make this easier for both of us, okay? I know exactly what you're up to and I'm not gonna let it happen.

HENRY:
Let what happen, Shawn? Yeah, if you don't mind my saying so, you've been a real jerk to me all week. I'm sorry I didn't tell you that your mother was coming back into town. I'm sorry you think that I messed up your whole youth. I'm sorry you think that I screwed up your life. Get over it. (slams hand on table)

SHAWN:
(stands) You had your chance. Now leave her alone. (walks away)

HENRY:
Shawn...

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

GUS and HAVERSHAM are in the living room. GUS is sitting on the couch as HAVERSHAM paces nervously.

GUS:
Did you know that Ogletree raises carrier pigeons?

The phone rings and HAVERSHAM answers.

HAVERSHAM:
Hello? Hello? (hangs up then turns to GUS) That's strange.

GUS:
Who called?

HAVERSHAM:
Me.

GUS:
(stands) You?

The phone rings again. They look at the caller ID.

HAVERSHAM:
There it is again. That's my number.

GUS:
From work?

HAVERSHAM:
No, from here.

GUS:
The call is coming from inside the house? Put it on speaker.

HAVERSHAM does so and all they can hear is indistinct whispering.

HAVERSHAM:
Hello? Who is this?

GUS:
Does this number have any other extensions?

HAVERSHAM:
No. Well, there's one, but it's not plugged in.

GUS:
Where is it? I'll go check it out.

HAVERSHAM:
Up in the attic.

GUS:
The attic?

GUS looks like he wants to run in the opposite direction.

HAVERSHAM:
I'll stay on the line. You... Good luck.

GUS strides to the stairs. He slows and looks over his shoulder at HAVERSHAM before continuing on.

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, HALL, NIGHT

At the top of the stairs, GUS hugs the banister and looks up the next flight towards the attic. He gathers himself and heads up the stairs that creak slightly.

INT. HAVERSHAM'S, ATTIC, NIGHT

GUS creeps towards a closed door and presses his ear against it, hearing the whispers. His hand trembles slightly as he grips the doorknob and opens it. He walks in and sees SHAWN sitting in a chair, a phone in his hand. SHAWN switches off the phone.

SHAWN:
Come on, don't be mad.

GUS:
You haunted my boss's house?

SHAWN:
It was the only way to show him how important and need you are. Look how brave you've been. If we're being honest, I think this has been a real confidence booster for you, buddy. Plus, once you solve the case, you're a hero, he never bothers you again. Maybe you'll get a numbered space in the green lot.

GUS:
Shawn, stop it. How did you even...

SHAWN:
(shushes) Gus. Friday, after you quit our business, I went to your office in hopes of haunting your Regional Sales Manager. Uh, Ogletree. Unfortunately, he doesn't believe in ghosts, so I had to go a little higher on the rung. [flash to SHAWN at Central Coast walking with a woman] Luckily for me, Katie from Accounts Receivable gave me a little tip about Haversham's wife. [in basement of house] Finally got to use my air conditioner and heating guy disguise. I had an ultrasonic beeper in my pocket for the dog. [Magnum in the kitchen barking] I actually thought you caught that one for a second. And, dude, hear me. [outside with vapor coming from his mouth] Don't ever, ever put dry ice in your mouth. It doesn't matter how well you wrap it up.

GUS:
Okay, what about the old woman?

SHAWN:
Young woman. She does Shakespeare in the Parking Lot down at the Albertson's by La Cumbre Plaza. [talks with her in the parking lot] She was all stoked to finally have a paying gig. Oh, and ditching the dress in the woods? Well, that was just an improv, because who knew Fearless Guster would come after her, you badass. The rest of it was pretty simple, really. I even visited Alice Bundy in prison to get a few pointers. [doctors the electrics]

GUS:
How do we solve it?

SHAWN:
Solve what?

GUS:
The ghost. How do we solve a case where you're the culprit?

SHAWN:
That is a very good question. I hadn't thought that far ahead.

GUS:
You haven't thought that far ahead?

SHAWN:
Well, give me a second.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

LASSITER is lying down on the couch describing a dream breakthrough.

LASSITER:
I'm hiding under the towel. And then I realize the towel's my life, and the pool is third grade, and the high dive is my father. (watch beeps and he sits up) Wow! Oh, wow, (puts gun back in holster) I... I poured out to you secrets even I didn't know I had. That was...amazing! I mean, it's so... liberating to-- to trust someone with your darkest innermost secrets. Where have you been? Why haven't you been here before? (puts on shoes)

MADDIE:
Oh, I used to be here quite a bit. I just recently came back. I know someone here who works for the department occasionally. Actually, he's my son.

LASSITER:
Really? Oh, you know, I know pretty much everybody who comes through the department. What's his name?

MADDIE:
Shawn Spencer.

LASSITER'S face falls.

INT. CENTRAL COAST, HAVERSHAM'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are reporting to HAVERSHAM about the case.

SHAWN:
Ghost gone. (makes "poof" motion with hands)

HAVERSHAM:
Just like that?

SHAWN:
Just like that. It's split. It's history. Will not be bothering you again. And that is a guarantee.

GUS:
100%.

HAVERSHAM:
How can you guarantee?

SHAWN:
Please don't ask. Just enjoy. And now, regarding our fee--

GUS shoves SHAWN with his arm.

SHAWN:
Of course, there will be no charge. Knowing that you appreciate the work that Gus does for the community...

GUS:
And for the company.

SHAWN:
It's more than enough reward. But if you were to insist on some sort of expense reimbursement, we, of course, would not accept.

HAVERSHAM:
Please, have a seat.

SHAWN and GUS sit.

HAVERSHAM:
I have a bit of the sixth sense myself, Mr. Guster. Helps me out when a business deal's about to go south. And it's bothering me right now. I don't understand this guarantee, and I don't like it. Last night, when that call came in, Guster, you went upstairs. At the end of that call, I heard something that made me question all of this.

SHAWN:
What was it?

HAVERSHAM:
It was the voice. Something was wrong with it.

SHAWN:
(leans forward) What was wrong with it?

HAVERSHAM:
It said "Gus."

SHAWN:
Gus?

HAVERSHAM:
Just like that.

SHAWN:
Well, sir, uh, I'm pretty sure that that can be easily explained.

HAVERSHAM:
(stands and walks to the door) Yes, I'm sure that it can. But there's something I really need for you to do for me right now.

GUS and SHAWN stand.

GUS:
Yes?

HAVERSHAM:
Leave. And, Mr. Guster, I will carefully ponder my next move and your future with the company.

HAVERSHAM opens the door to reveal OGLETREE waiting outside.

OGLETREE:
Let's talk, Burton.

GUS walks out into the hall and OGLETREE pulls him aside. SHAWN walks to the door and stops in front of HAVERSHAM.

SHAWN:
Well, thank you for your time, Mr. Haversham. I'm sorry you don't believe me. But I do understand.

SHAWN holds out his hand, and, after a pause, HAVERSHAM shakes it. His hand begins to shake and he pulls it away from HAVERSHAM'S.

SHAWN:
Can we speak privately?

Out in the hall, GUS shakes his head.

HAVERSHAM:
(to OGLETREE) Just one second. (shuts door) What's your game? (walks over and leans against the front of his desk)

SHAWN:
(wipes hand against chest) I have two games. Red Rover and lawn darts. (walks towards HAVERSHAM) We'd need at least four for even the most rudimentary game of Rover and they don't make lawn darts anymore. Too dangerous. But that's not why I'm here. I sensed several things in that house that I couldn't tell you with other people in the room.

HAVERSHAM:
This is getting desperate, Mr. Spencer, but, please, wow me.

SHAWN:
You weren't raised by your father. (puts hands to head and remembers photos) You were raised by your grandmother. It was her ring. Her ring that your wife wears now.

HAVERSHAM:
Okay, perhaps my father wasn't as present as I'd hoped and, yes, my wife wears my grandmother's ring. That doesn't mean anything.

SHAWN:
Maybe not to you, but the sanctity of marriage means a lot to your grandmother, and having an affair with, what? A secretary? That just feels wrong. No matter how good her pappardelle is.

HAVERSHAM:
And just what the hell are you accusing me of?

SHAWN remembers that the china HAVERSHAM used for his hot cocoa was the same that BIANCA used for her pappardelle. He also remembers HADEWYCH hearing a woman's voice at the house when the wife was gone.

SHAWN:
No accusations here. I'm just telling you, your grandmother is very disappointed in you. And she doesn't want you to go to jail.

HAVERSHAM:
Well, nothing you've accused me of is illegal.

SHAWN remembers GUS singing HAVERSHAM'S praises how he revamped the whole inventory system. He also recalls the boxes he saw in the basement.

SHAWN:
Repackaging samples and reselling them, while lucrative, is highly illegal.

HAVERSHAM:
So what is this now? A shakedown?

SHAWN:
No, there's no shakedown. I'm just telling you what I know. I'm a psychic, and with great power comes great responsibility. And that responsibility I share with Gus. (points towards the door) All we want is the opportunity to continue doing our work.

HAVERSHAM:
Just between us?

SHAWN:
I'm a psychic. I can't lie.

They shake hands.

INT. CENTRAL COAST, HALL, DAY

HAVERSHAM opens the door and he steps out followed by SHAWN.

HAVERSHAM:
Mr. Guster, back to work. As per our conversation, your raise will be reflected in your next check.

OGLETREE:
(scoffs) Uh, I'm sorry, I'm confused.

HAVERSHAM:
Spend a little more time on your own business, Frankjim. (slaps OGLETREE on the arm) Excuse me. (goes back into his office and shuts the door)

SHAWN:
(to OGLETREE) I know about you too.

SHAWN and GUS walk away down the hall.

SHAWN:
His hair is horrible.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN walks down the hall and meets up with MADDIE.

SHAWN:
She who bore me.

They hug.

MADDIE:
What are you doing here, Goose?

SHAWN:
Oh, I finished working on my case. And I had this amazing idea that I would come by and scoop you up, and take you to a movie, and it would just be us.

MADDIE:
Actually, your dad was planning on coming by.

SHAWN:
Of course he was. Okay, I'll go. (turns to leave)

MADDIE:
(grabs SHAWN'S arm) Wait. Enough. What happened?

SHAWN:
When?

MADDIE:
Between you two.

SHAWN:
(scoffs) Mom, that is a veritable lifetime of conversations.

MADDIE:
Follow me. (pulls SHAWN by the arm down the hall)

SHAWN:
No, Mom! Mom, come on.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

MADDIE opens the door, pulling SHAWN in behind her.

SHAWN:
My God.

MADDIE whirls SHAWN around so he's in front of the couch.

MADDIE:
Sit!

SHAWN:
Are we really gonna do this?

MADDIE:
Sit down! (puts hands in his shoulders, pushing him down)

SHAWN:
(sits) Okay.

MADDIE:
What happened? Don't mince words.

SHAWN:
With Dad? Mom, we were both there. You know, we don't need to revisit the past.

MADDIE:
Maybe we do.

SHAWN:
Well, I'm not sure I wanna forgive him for what happened.

MADDIE:
The divorce?

SHAWN:
It wasn't what happened, Mom. It was the way that it happened. (leans forward) I mean, let's call it what it was. He left us. He left you. (angrily) He ended up with the house, and he left you by yourself to pick up the pieces! That's not exactly what I call hero material, you know?

MADDIE:
Shawn, I left him.

SHAWN:
(laughs) Come on, Mom. You don't have to spin this for me, okay? (rests head in palms)

MADDIE:
Let me be clear. (stands and walks across the room) Your father was wonderful to me. He wanted to keep going to counseling, he kept saying we could make it, but the writing was on the wall a long time.

SHAWN:
You're losing me here, Mom. What are you...

MADDIE:
(walks back and sits) When I got that job out of town, it was an incredible opportunity. I was afraid I would never have a chance again, so I took it. You were into your senior year. Your path was set. (tears fall down her cheeks) It seemed the right time, if such a thing is possible. I thought, of all people, that you would be okay. And I am so sorry.

SHAWN:
(takes MADDIE'S hand) Mom, you don't ever have to be sorry. About anything.

MADDIE:
Don't you spin this. Sometimes I get the worst realizations. I know. I know that I failed you, but I think that day, my life began again. And that sounds terrible, but don't you ever think I wanted to leave you.

SHAWN looks out the office window and sees HENRY enter the station dressed in a nice shirt. He sees HENRY check himself in a mirror and straighten his collar. He turns and sees SHAWN and MADDIE and holds up his hand in a small wave.

Episode 3x02 Murder? ...Anyone? ...Anyone? ...Bueller?

EXT. LELAND BOSSEIGH HIGH SCHOOL, NIGHT

The lit sign at the front reads "Reunion Tonight!!! Welcome Back Class of 1995!"

INT. LBHS, GYM, NIGHT

The gym is decorated in an island theme. People are still moving tables and making last-minute adjustments. GUS is standing at the table holding the punch.

GUS:
Who put the orange slices in the punch bowl already? They'll be soggy by the time everyone gets here. This is a disaster, people!

SHAWN:
(wanders over) Yep. First, typhoid fever, now this?

GUS:
Shawn, this night has been 13 years in the making. Everything has to go perfectly. What I need from you is your support and your cooperation. Not your sarcasm and mockery.

SHAWN:
Okay, buddy. Let me know when I can mock, 'cause I'm ready to mock.

GUS:
(points to SHAWN'S shirt) Where's your grad pic?

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah, I'm not gonna wear mine. (chews on snack)

GUS:
Shawn, come on. Don't do this to me. You know that was my thing. (walks away) Instead of name tags, we'll know who everyone is from their class picture. Great idea, right?

SHAWN:
(checks watch) Is it mock time yet? (follows GUS)

INT. LBHS, ENTRANCE HALL, NIGHT

GUS and SHAWN walk into the hall to the welcome table. There's a pineapple sitting on the table with the other tropical decorations.

GUS:
Just put it on, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(clips on badge) Okay, fine.

GUS:
(takes clipboard from man at the table) Excuse me.

SHAWN:
There. You happy now?

GUS:
(looks up) Shawn, that isn't you, is it?

SHAWN:
No, it isn't.

GUS:
It's Judd Nelson, isn't it?

SHAWN:
Yes, it is, and it's sweet, sweet nice.

The door opens and in walks a man in a letterman's jacket with a beautiful woman. He is greeted by other athletes.

SHAWN:
Look who just rolled in. Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy. (sees he's wearing cowboy boots) From Fresh Horses.

GUS:
That's Howie Tolkin. He was our quarterback junior and senior year.

SHAWN:
We had a football team?

GUS:
Yes.

HOWIE puts his arm around the woman's shoulder.

SHAWN:
Tackle?

GUS:
Seriously?

SHAWN:
Who's the prom queen?

GUS:
She's the prom queen. Eileen Mazwell. You really don't remember any of this? They're married now.

A woman enters alone wearing a spaghetti strap red dress. SHAWN is surprised to see her.

SHAWN:
Dude, you didn't tell me Abigail Lytar was coming.

GUS:
(sees the look on SHAWN'S face) Oh, yeah.

SHAWN:
(clears throat) I should... Should say hello.

GUS shakes his head as SHAWN walks over to Abigail who is reading a poster.

SHAWN:
Abigail Lytar.

ABIGAIL:
(turns around and looks at his picture) Judd Nelson.

SHAWN:
In the flesh.

ABIGAIL:
I loved you in From the Hip.

SHAWN:
Thank you very much. You know, there are those who believe I flared my nostrils too much in that film.

ABIGAIL:
Oh, no. I mean, how else could we have possibly known how angst-ridden you were?

SHAWN:
I agree.

ABIGAIL:
So.

SHAWN:
Yeah, so...

GUS:
Shawn! Hello, Abigail.

ABIGAIL:
Hi.

GUS:
I need you to go to the cafeteria and grab another stack of folding chairs for me. We're already short.

SHAWN:
Consider it done. One problem: where's the cafeteria?

GUS:
Did you even attend this school? Just grab the chairs. (starts to walk away)

SHAWN:
I don't know where I'm going!

GUS:
Maybe Abigail could help you.

SHAWN:
(looks at ABIGAIL) I like that. I like that very much.

INT. LBHS, HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN and ABIGAIL walk through the hall lined with lockers. SHAWN is slightly ahead. ABIGAIL sighs and smacks SHAWN with her bag. They stop.

ABIGAIL:
You really don't remember what happened between us in high school, do you? Stern's Wharf? Senior year? The carnival on the pier? You pursued me, like, every day of senior year, and then I finally agreed to go out with you, and then you didn't show up.

SHAWN:
I... Uh, yeah, yes. (continues walking) Here's the thing, Abigail, and not a lot of people know this, I was actually working as a midwife back then, family business, and I got a call from a client late at night going into labor. 34 hours, it was a lot of screaming, fair amount of pushing, some dilation, tongs...

ABIGAIL:
I can see where it wouldn't have occurred to you to call me. But you know what? It was 13 years ago. Hardly matters now.

SHAWN:
Exactly, is what I'm saying! It was, like, forever ago! We're adults now, doing adult things. And you're a teacher. That's fantastic.

ABIGAIL:
What about you? Or are you still in midwifery?

SHAWN:
No, no. I've dabbled in quite a few things, actually, but I landed quite nicely on psychic detective.

ABIGAIL giggles.

SHAWN:
That's for real.

ABIGAIL:
Who would actually choose to be a psychic?

SHAWN:
First of all, it's a gift, it's not a choice. And I happen to be very, very good at it.

ABIGAIL scoffs.

SHAWN:
I solve crimes for the Santa Barbara police department. It's kind of a big deal.

ABIGAIL:
(sarcastically) You solve crimes?

SHAWN:
All the time.

ABIGAIL:
(giggles) Okay, well, you be sure to let me know if you sense that, you know, someone here at the reunion is gonna steal my lunch money.

SHAWN:
That's very clever.

They stop. SHAWN is facing the window. He sees what looks like a body in a letterman jacket fall past.

SHAWN:
Did you see that?

ABIGAIL:
What, is someone getting their lunch money stolen?

SHAWN:
I think it's a little bit bigger than that.

EXT. LELAND BOSSEIGH HIGH SCHOOL, NIGHT

SHAWN, GUS and ABIGAIL are outside on the grounds where the body should be. There's nothing there.

SHAWN:
Someone was murdered here. I am absolutely 100% certain that I sensed a body drop here. Right here. I don't know who. But I can see he was wearing a letterman's jacket of some sort.

GUS:
Are you doing this to me on purpose? Are you fabricating some kind of foul play just to mess up the night for me?

SHAWN:
Yes, I am. I killed someone here at our high school reunion just to foil your 13-year video retrospective of best pep rally moments.

GUS:
Do you even know what a pep captain is, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Yeah, he's a male cheerleader I believe.

GUS:
It's a leader among men, Shawn! A leader among men!

SHAWN:
Who cheers. I saw Bring It On.

ABIGAIL:
Oh, wait, I get it. You guys are dating? You're together? Everything makes sense.

GUS:
We are not dating.

SHAWN:
Are you kidding me? He was voted "Most Likely to Succeed". Think he's gonna date me?

GUS:
No body, no crime, Shawn. (turns and walks away)

SHAWN:
Gus, buddy...

GUS:
No body, no crime!

SHAWN:
Gus!

GUS:
No body, no crime. (voice fades)

SHAWN:
He's just gonna keep saying that, isn't he?

ABIGAIL:
I believe so, yes. (slaps him on the arm and walks away)

SHAWN:
But... You don't believe me either?

ABIGAIL:
No body, no crime, Shawn.

SHAWN:
But, Abigail!

SHAWN looks down on the ground and sees two pins: an "S" and "C".

INT. HENRY'S, KITCHEN, NIGHT

HENRY is preparing steaks for dinner. He looks up and sighs.

INT. MADDIE'S HOTEL ROOM, NIGHT

MADDIE is stretched out on the bed in her pajamas with files and her laptop. The phone rings.

MADDIE:
Hello?

INT. HENRY'S, KITCHEN, NIGHT

HENRY'S is standing at the counter.

HENRY:
Hey, hi.

MADDIE:
Henry?

HENRY:
Yes, yes, it's me, Henry, your ex-husband. Look, I don't want to bother you, but... How you doing?

MADDIE:
Great. And you?

HENRY:
Great. Doing great.

MADDIE:
Well, there's that.

HENRY:
Hey, Madeleine, listen. I'm just about to cook up a steak here, and I've got another one sitting right next to it. I was just thinking, you know, if you're hungry, you could, uh... Would you... Or not. I, uh...

MADDIE:
Honestly, I would love to taste one of your steaks, but I just had a delicious salad from room service.

HENRY:
Hey, no biggie. I, you know... Of course, I just was concerned that you hadn't eaten and now that I know that you had salad, I feel better and... Ba-ba-boom! (laughs) Have a good night.

MADDIE:
You too.

HENRY:
Okay, bye.

MADDIE ends the call.

HENRY:
Ba-ba-boom?

INT. LBHS, GYM, NIGHT

The reunion is well underway. Couples dance to the band. SHAWN hurries over to GUS.

SHAWN:
Okay, dude, I think I'm on to something. Now, true, there may not be an actual body, but I am telling you that a very real crime was committed here and there is very real evidence.

GUS:
I would like to see some evidence of some folding chairs, Shawn.

SHAWN:
If you're not gonna take this seriously, then I will pull out this phone, (holds up phone) and I will call Lassiter.

GUS turns around and talks to the man next to him.

GUS:
Hey, Could you start distributing these ballots for the reunion king and queen to everybody? (hands over ballots)

SHAWN:
Dialing, connecting. Ringing.

SHAWN puts the phone to his ear. The ringing sounds in the gym. SHAWN and GUS turn towards the sound to see LASSITER standing by the punch bowl, phone in hand. SHAWN and GUS walk over as LASSITER pours a glass.

GUS:
Lassiter, what are you doing at our reunion?

LASSITER:
Well, first off, of course it had to be yours, 'cause that's my luck. And secondly, I'm on a date.

SHAWN:
Well, we're on a case, and you're on it with us.

LASSITER:
Not tonight I'm not.

GUS:
On a date? With a person?

LASSITER:
Yes, with a person. Blonde, yellow dress. (looks over to woman dancing on the floor)

SHAWN:
Mindy Howland?

LASSITER:
Mmm-hmm.

GUS:
Isn't that the girl who stuffed Bobby Cobetts in his own car trunk when he wouldn't kiss her at the Spring Fling?

LASSITER:
We met at the Santa Barbara Bowl at the Ravi Shankar concert last week, and she asked me out on a date.

GUS:
Who goes to someone else's reunion when they barely even know them?

SHAWN:
Who goes to a Ravi Shankar concert?

LASSITER:
Look, I didn't realize it was a reunion until I showed up. But we have a very deep connection.

SHAWN:
Same connection you have with the sitar?

MINDY comes over and puts her hand on LASSITER'S shoulder.

MINDY:
(sighs) Where's my punch, Corey?

SHAWN:
Yeah, where's her punch, Corey?

MINDY turns around and makes a face at the two of them.

GUS:
Hello, Mindy. You look nice.

MINDY:
Give it up, Button-Up. I already have a date to this thing.

SHAWN:
Mindy, it's official. You've won "Bitchiest Banana". And now I am going to borrow Detective Lassiter for as long as I'd like. (takes LASSITER away by the arm)

MINDY:
Detec... Wait, he's a cop?

SHAWN:
All right, I have to be discreet. Gus has a very weak constitution for these sorts of things. I witnessed a murder here tonight.

LASSITER:
What? Who?

SHAWN:
I'm not entirely sure.

LASSITER:
What did you see?

SHAWN:
I didn't actually see anything. I psychically witnessed it with my third eye.

LASSITER:
Where's the body?

SHAWN:
There's not one.

LASSITER:
Listen up. Let me impart to you a little police wisdom we like to throw around down at the station. No body, no crime.

SHAWN:
What, do you guys put that on a t-shirt?

LASSITER:
Fine. Who did it? And why?

SHAWN:
I don't know. But, (taps LASSITER on the chest) I don't know.

LASSITER:
Do you have a murder weapon?

SHAWN:
Nope.

LASSITER:
Well, then good night, Spencer. (walks away)

SHAWN looks back to GUS who is nodding his head to the music. He walks over.

SHAWN:
Gus, this so-called football team of ours, were we any good?

GUS:
Yes, we won State Champ our senior year. Seriously, you didn't go to any of the games?

SHAWN:
The games were on Fridays. That would mean missing Step by Step. But this winning state, would that get you some sort of special pin?

GUS:
Yes, Shawn. The State Champs pin.

SHAWN flashes on all the letterman jackets but the only one with the "SC" pin is HOWIE.

SHAWN:
I got it. (walks over to LASSITER) Lassie, I know who the murder victim is.

LASSITER:
Who?

SHAWN:
Class of '95, Sabercats' starting quarterback (fake announces) Howie Tolkin!

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
What?

SHAWN turns around to see what GUS is looking at. HOWIE and EILEEN have just re-entered the gym.

SHAWN:
Howie.

LASSITER looks at him like he's made a fool of himself - again.

SHAWN:
Hold that thought.

INT. LBHS, ENTRANCE HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN exits the gym on the phone.

SHAWN:
Look, Jules, just get down here as fast as you can. I really need your help on this case. It's intense. Well, I will fill you in on the rest when you get here. Thank you. (ends call)

INT. LBHS, GYM, NIGHT

LASSITER and MINDY are with another couple.

MINDY:
So Carl, this is my ex-boyfriend from high school all four years, Eldon.

ELDON:
(shakes hands with LASSITER) Nice to meet you, buddy.

MINDY:
Yeah. (sighs and stares at ELDON before clearing throat) Right. And this is his, his brand-new wife, Stephanie. Yeah. So, I'm dating a cop now. (puts hands possessively on LASSITER'S shoulder)

ELDON:
(scoffs) Oh, really?

LASSITER:
(self-effacing) Yeah.

ELDON:
You ever shoot anybody?

LASSITER:
Well, I don't...

MINDY:
Of course he has. Probably a bunch of people.

LASSITER:
A bunch? I mean, you know, what is a bunch really?

MINDY clears her throat and grips him tighter.

LASSITER:
I... Yes.

INT. LBHS, HALL, NIGHT

Two men are leaning against the wall bemoaning their single status.

MAN 1:
Women. Absolutely nothing but heartache, man.

A third man agrees. He speaks with a thick Indian accent.

MAN 3:
All they want is a ring, man. They won't stop till they get the ring.

SHAWN is leaning against the wall at the end.

SHAWN:
Dude, I could not have said it better myself. Maybe clearer, but I agree. I'm just like you guys. I... I hope to kiss one, someday.

MAN 1:
Exactly. You know, dude, you're just like us, marginally employed, single, never been married. I mean, you get it.

SHAWN turns his head and notices the trophy case was broken into and everything having to do with HOWIE'S success has been scratched and tampered with. He turns to look at the others.

SHAWN:
Did you guys see someone tampering with this case?

MAN 1:
No, but I wish I'd thought of that. I would love to see that Tolkin guy go down. He terrorized me in high school.

MAN 2:
They build a shrine for him 'cause he can throw a football? Who cares?

SHAWN:
Exactly.

MAN 3:
Hey, why don't they build a shrine to my butt?

They all laugh. JULIET arrives wearing a dress.

JULIET:
There you are! I've been looking all over for you.

MAN 1:
Dude, you totally lied to us. You have a girl, and she is hot.

SHAWN:
(holds out a hand) Excuse us, dudes. (walks away with JULIET) Okay, what are you wearing?

JULIET:
What? You said you were on a case and there were possible criminal suspects down here that might get spooked by cops sniffing around.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but what are you wearing? This is a reunion, not the prom. I need you to fit in.

JULIET:
What? This? This isn't a prom dress.

SHAWN:
It looks like a prom dress. It's a little... Poofy.

JULIET:
It doesn't poof. There's no poof.

SHAWN:
A slight poof.

JULIET:
Look, it's what I was gonna wear to my high school reunion that I couldn't go to because I was on a case. Just show me where these suspects are that I need to vet.

SHAWN:
I don't know if you need to "vet" anything. The animals are fine. But let's poof on over, and I'll point 'em out to you.

INT. LBHS, GYM, NIGHT

MINDY is going through her purse as LASSITER watches the room.

MINDY:
Oh, thanks for playing up that whole tough guy cop thing, you know, with Eldon. (takes out compact) That was really nice of you. I think the "I'm packing heat" thing was a little overboard, but he seemed to buy it, so... (checks her makeup in the mirror)

LASSITER:
But I am packing heat. (opens jacket to reveal badge and holster)

MINDY:
(gasps) That's cute. What, do you squeeze the trigger and a little pen comes out so you can write people parking tickets? Barnaby Jones, why don't you hold my purse while I go dance? (slaps her purse on LASSITER'S chest and walks off)

SHAWN:
(takes JULIET by the arm and walks with her)I called you because I need your help... (sees HOWIE and EILEEN) Oh, my God! It's Howie and Eileen! (points at photo badge) Abe Frohman, Sausage King of Chicago.

HOWIE points at SHAWN to show recognition.

SHAWN:
(laughs) Yes! We all spent our wonder years together.

HOWIE:
Right.

SHAWN:
You guys look great. Especially you. I want you battin' clean-up, if you catch my meaning. Look at that package, huh? I don't mean to be a downer, guys, but did you know that somebody tampered with your football shrine?

HOWIE:
Ah! Dude, seriously, that's just old high school stuff. I don't even think about that anymore. I'm actually on to much bigger stuff now, so...

EILEEN:
Howie just announced his candidacy for State Assembly last month.

HOWIE:
Yeah, dude. I care about the issues. I actually think I can make a difference. Isn't that right, babe?

EILEEN:
That's right, baby.

HOWIE:
See, after I fix the state of California, I'm gonna write a motivational book for losers who need help. And the working title right now is Move It Or Move It!

SHAWN:
Wow, that is so much stuff.

JULIET:
Wow, yeah.

SHAWN:
When will you find time to tape Larry Lester's butt cheeks together?

JULIET laughs but HOWIE and EILEEN don't get the reference.

SHAWN:
Never saw Breakfast Club? Either of you?

HOWIE:
(holds out arm for EILEEN) Okay, baby, Howie wants one of those little mini quesadillas. Let's get after it.

HOWIE and EILEEN walk away.

SHAWN:
Who hasn't seen The Breakfast Club?

JULIET:
(shakes head) Um...

SHAWN:
You honestly don't think there's anything suspicious about those two?

JULIET:
I'm not sure. I mean, for a guy who's clearly stuck in the past, he seemed to brush off the whole vandalism of his trophy case thing pretty easily. (walks slowly) I could dust the case for prints, but that's it.

SHAWN:
(walking with JULIET) Jules, anyone who enters or exits this place is a suspect. This thing ends before I solve the homicide, you can kiss the murderer good-bye. (sees GUS at punch bowl) Gus, thank goodness. I need to get to the roof, I need to get into the library, I need to psychically remember everything about high school.

GUS:
That stuff is locked up tight. This place is like Fort Knox tonight.

SHAWN:
(slams hand on table) Fine. Where's the gymnasium?

GUS:
We're in the gymnasium, Shawn.

SHAWN looks around, noticing the basketball hoops and the scoreboard behind the decorations.

SHAWN:
Wow, buddy, you did a really nice job.

INT. HENRY'S, KITCHEN, NIGHT

HENRY is sitting alone at the table eating his steak dinner. The phone rings and he looks at the Caller ID before answering.

HENRY:
Hey, Shawn, what's up?

INT. LBHS, ENTRANCE HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN is standing off to the side.

SHAWN:
Listen, Dad, remember that box of my old high school stuff that Mom put away for me? There's... It was just a... It was a box of stuff.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. HENRY'S, KITCHEN, NIGHT

HENRY:
What box?

SHAWN:
The box.

HENRY:
What box, Shawn?

SHAWN:
What am I thinking? Mom's in town. Do me a favor. Call her, find out where she put it.

HENRY:
I can't. I can't.

SHAWN:
What do you mean you can't?

HENRY:
I can't. I just talked to her, Shawn, and I think she thought... I mean, supposedly... She had a salad. Who am I to think that she didn't have a salad? I just...

SHAWN:
Dad, I need this box. I'm on a case, okay? Just call her, locate the box. I will come get it from you.

HENRY:
(rubs hand on head) Fine.

SHAWN:
Fine. (ends call) What is he talk... I don't... (walks away)

INT. HENRY'S, ATTIC, NIGHT

HENRY is looking at a packed shelf. MADDIE is at another shelf.

HENRY:
I just don't see it.

MADDIE:
You're not looking.

HENRY:
There's so much stuff. What is all this crap?

MADDIE:
It's your life.

HENRY:
These boxes are not my life.

MADDIE:
Well, it's stuff from your life anyway. I boxed it all up 'cause I thought maybe someday you'd want to look at it again, when you're old and crotchety.

HENRY:
(picks up box) Yeah, well, I just want to dump it all. (tosses it aside)

MADDIE:
Which in your case would be today.

HENRY finds a small box on a shelf and picks it up, excited.

HENRY:
Look it this! (holds up a small car) Look at that!

MADDIE:
What is it?

HENRY:
It's a matchbox car. It's Shawn's first one. I bought it for him when I brought him home, remember?

MADDIE:
(takes car) I do.

HENRY:
He never even played with it.

MADDIE:
Henry, you bought him a squad car.

HENRY:
Kids love police cars.

MADDIE:
(puts the car in the box) But they're all police cars, all 20 of them.

HENRY:
No, no, no. They're all different. (holds up each car) You see that one there, that's a squad car. This one here, see that? (sits in old chair) It's a paddy wagon. A prison transport vehicle, that's an old one. Oh, look at that! A crowd control van. Look, it even has little tiny water cannons up on top.

MADDIE:
Here's the box he wanted.

INT. LBHS, GYM, NIGHT

GUS is chatting with a WOMAN by the buffet table.

WOMAN:
You know, I thought you would've become, like, a doctor or something like that.

GUS:
Well, what I do is pretty fascinating.

WOMAN:
Really? How so?

GUS:
Well, with my specialty, which is mucus reducers, I use a mixture of... (realizes he's losing audience) Did I also tell you that I have a side psychic detective business that I started with my buddy?

WOMAN:
Really?

GUS:
Yeah. And I may or may not have tracked down a counterfeiter, unveiled a nanny ring, saved the show American Duos, stuff like that.

WOMAN:
That was you? I remember that.

GUS:
So, I'm kind of working on a case right now. (shushes)

WOMAN:
Really? God, that's hot.

On the other side of the dance floor, HENRY and MADDIE enter the gym. SHAWN pushes his way through the dancers over to them.

SHAWN:
Hi! What are you guys doing here?

HENRY:
Whoa! Slow down. We brought you the box you were bitching about.

SHAWN:
No. No, no, Dad. I asked you to locate the box so that I could come pick it up from you, not to drag mom down to my high school reunion.

MADDIE:
Lighten up, honey. What are you so worried about? It's not like I'm gonna pull out a Kleenex, wet it, and then wipe the corners of your mouth.

HENRY laughs.

MADDIE:
Look, it's Gus. I have to say hello. (walks away)

SHAWN:
(bounces on his feet) No, Mom! There aren't really any other parents here. (turns to HENRY) Awesome. What exactly are you up to?

HENRY:
All right, look, Shawn, I went to this school too, so it was my school long before it was yours.

SHAWN:
Okay, fine. You win "Oldest Student Here" award. Now will you please leave? I'm sure the nondescript blazer rental place is about to close.

MINDY bumps into LASSITER who is clutching her purse to his chest.

MINDY:
Hey, hey, cutie patootie!

LASSITER:
Look, seriously, my name is Carlton, okay? How hard is that to remember? Carl-ton.

MINDY:
Yeah, I know your name, silly. I just think a better name for you is Cutie Patootie, you know, because you have such a cutie patootie. (gooses him)

LASSITER:
Hey, there! Exactly how much of that punch have you had?

MINDY:
Just enough to realize, you know, that I might've been a little short with you before and I'm very sorry. Can you forgive me? Hmm? (tickles)

LASSITER:
(giggles) Maybe.

MINDY:
Yeah? Yeah? Good, 'cause I... I have just one teensy weensy little tiny favor to ask of you.

LASSITER:
What's that?

MINDY:
I need you to make a move on Eldon's wife, Stephanie, 'cause I want that painted whore out of the picture. Okay? Can you do that for me?

LASSITER:
(appalled) No, I cannot do that for you.

MINDY:
Fine. You suck! (walks away)

LASSITER:
What? Hey, your purse! (the purse tips and items fall to the floor) Crap. Oh, great. (picks up prescription bottles) Well, that figures.

SHAWN takes the box and sets it on a table over in a corner. GUS follows. SHAWN digs around in the box and pulls out a large ring of keys.

GUS:
What are those?

SHAWN:
Just a copy of every key in the school. By the end of senior year, I managed to become a member of the Trans-American Western Custodial Union, Local 456. (puts the lid back on the box) Don't hold me to this, but I believe I still have voting privileges.

INT. LBHS, ENTRANCE HALL, NIGHT

HENRY and MADDIE exit the gym.

HENRY:
It's been 35 years since I've wandered these halls. I think I'm gonna take a look around. You wanna join me?

MADDIE:
That depends. Do you have a hall pass?

HENRY:
You kidding? I used to own these halls.

INT. LBHS, GYM, NIGHT

SHAWN walks over to ABIGAIL holding two cups of punch.

ABIGAIL:
Did you bring me a glass of punch as some sort of 13-year peace offering?

SHAWN:
Oh, no. Sorry, these are both for me, actually. (drinks one)  I can grab you one though if you'd like.

ABIGAIL:
No.

SHAWN:
I do have a question for you though. Assuming that Parker Stevenson had never been born... (pulls out the keys) Have you ever seen a very attractive man solve a crime before?

ABIGAIL:
I did see John Cusack prevent a jaywalking once.

EXT. LBHS, ROOF, NIGHT

SHAWN and ABIGAIL walk out onto the rooftop. SHAWN takes deep breaths before stopping.

SHAWN:
This is good. Yeah. Just, give me a minute. I'm gonna have to do my thing, okay? You might want to steady or brace yourself.

ABIGAIL:
Why, what's going to happen?

SHAWN:
Well, I can't really say with any degree of accuracy, but I can tell you that some animals, slow adults, and beautiful girls have been known to swoon.

ABIGAIL:
You just called me slow.

SHAWN:
Excuse me.

SHAWN dances 80s style around the roof, at one point crashing into a large vent.

ABIGAIL:
Are you okay?

SHAWN starts dancing again and ABIGAIL smiles.

SHAWN:
I'm a slave to it.

SHAWN dances up to ABIGAIL as she laughs. He holds his hands up on either side of her face, shushing her.

SHAWN:
Wait for it. (strokes his hands down her face his thumbs pinching her nose) Wait for it...

ABIGAIL snorts with laughter.

SHAWN:
Don't do that. Don't mock the spirit.

She laughs and SHAWN shushes her again.

SHAWN:
It's beneath you.

SHAWN removes his hands and breathes deep.

SHAWN:
Have you ever wondered why you haven't been married yet?

ABIGAIL:
I don't have to wonder. I know why.

SHAWN:
Well, why?

ABIGAIL:
I will get married someday. (sniffs) I just haven't met him yet.

SHAWN:
You don't think?

ABIGAIL:
What about you?

SHAWN:
What about me? Abigail, lots of strapping, brilliant-type guys never got married. Ludwig van Beethoven. Sir Isaac Newton, right? Doing his thing. Jon Lovitz... Jon Lovitz's brother...

SHAWN and ABIGAIL start leaning in closer to each other.

ABIGAIL:
Jon Lovitz has a brother?

SHAWN:
Does it really matter?

Just as their lips are about to touch, SHAWN sees a distinctive footprint in the dirt on the roof and knows it is from HOWIE'S boots.

SHAWN:
(pulls away from ABIGAIL) I just figured it out.

ABIGAIL:
What? Why you never got married?

SHAWN:
No, I know who our murderers are.

INT. LBHS, GYM, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are watching HOWIE and EILEEN across the gym.

GUS:
So, wait, now you are saying that Howie and Eileen are the killers?

SHAWN:
Yep.

GUS:
Wasn't Howie the victim at one point?

SHAWN:
Gus, that is so 40 minutes ago. I bet you're still telling your friends to "chillax."

GUS:
Shawn, why would two people who just killed someone be so casual, smiling, dancing?

SHAWN:
I agree. It is both surreal and disturbing to watch two murderers do the cabbage patch. That's the point, Gus. They're trying to look as casual as possible. But I'm not fooled. The question is why are they sticking around?

INT. LBHS, LIBRARY, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS search yearbooks.

SHAWN:
We're looking for info on our beloved couple. Anything that might say "future killers."

GUS:
What does that word even mean anyway? Greatness. It's like they purposely set you up for failure. I mean, what have I done in my life that anyone would say was great?

SHAWN:
Dude, the perfect cocoa roundness of your head alone makes you great.

GUS:
That's easy for you to say, Shawn. No one had any expectations you would amount to greatness.

SHAWN:
Gus, don't be an incorrigible Eskimo Pie with a caramel ribbon. It doesn't matter what these people think of you, but, and I put this out there as a challenge to you, you really want to show 'em you've lived up to your potential? Help me solve this case, please. Come on! How many of our classmates are out there solving a murder tonight? Huh? A handful, maybe? You could be one of them.

SHAWN continues to flip through an open yearbook. He keeps spotting the same student in the background of pictures with HOWIE and EILEEN as the main focus. In one, he has a letterman jacket.

SHAWN:
Duckie.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Dude! We've been looking in the wrong John Hughes movie. This isn't Breakfast Club, or Curly Sue or Mr. Mom. And it certainly isn't Flubber.

GUS:
Why are you hatin' on Flubber?

SHAWN:
I would never hate on Flubber.

GUS:
I'm not following.

SHAWN:
What do all the best John Hughes movies have in common? A love triangle. There's always a Duckie. (points at the guy in the picture) Do you recognize that guy?

GUS:
Vaguely. I don't know his name though. Check the grad pics.

They both flip through the pages.

SHAWN:
He didn't show up. 17 no-shows. He's one of them. The question is which one. Duckie, where are you?

GUS:
Is this the same guy? (points to a picture of the same man in auto shop)

SHAWN:
Good work, Gus. This is good. (remembers the lock on the trophy case) I think I just figured something out. I gotta make a quick stop. Are we back in business, partner? Milo and Otis. (holds out his fist)

GUS:
I get to be Otis?

SHAWN:
That's a given.

GUS:
Okay. (bumps SHAWN'S fist and stands) But look, I have to get back to the gym and make sure all the ballots are in or we won't have a reunion king and queen. Meet you there?

SHAWN:
Yeah. Or we could meet back here and give each other makeovers to Karla DeVito's We Are Not Alone. It's your choice.

INT. LBHS, HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN is outside Auto Shop going through his ring of keys to find the right one. He goes to unlock it and it creaks open. He steps inside.

INT. LBHS, AUTO SHOP, NIGHT

SHAWN switches on the lights and looks around. In one of the partial cars, HENRY is sitting behind the wheel.

SHAWN:
Dad? What are you doing here? (walks over to the car) How did... How did you even get in here?

HENRY:
Place was open. (reaches across and opens door) Your mom and I were just looking around. She's in the bathroom.

SHAWN:
(gets in the car) So what, you just... You just thought it was a normal thing so sit here in the dark?

HENRY:
Shawn, I used to fix up cars in this very place when I was in high school. I actually dropped the tranny out of a '57 Chevy just like this one, practically rebuilt the thing from scratch. When that thing was done, baby, I tell you, it purred.

SHAWN:
Now I feel awful.

HENRY:
Why?

SHAWN:
Mom. She's still in the bathroom. She missed that entire story.

HENRY:
Shawn, it's not my fault that you never cared about anything in high school.

SHAWN:
Yeah, well, as it turns out, it seems I did care about something. I guess it doesn't matter much anymore.

HENRY nods his head, telling SHAWN to explain.

SHAWN:
Dad, do you think you can miss out on a moment?

HENRY:
What do you mean?

SHAWN:
Like an opportunity. You think you could miss an opportunity in a moment, you know, and then it's too late, and the course of your life is changed forever?

HENRY:
Yeah. Absolutely. Wait a minute. Is this about a girl?

SHAWN:
Maybe.

HENRY:
Life is not made up of a single moment. It's made up of a gazillion moments. What defines us is the choice we make in the next moment, and the one after that. These moments, Shawn, they're happening. (continuously snaps fingers) They're all around us, all the time.

SHAWN leans backwards and sees a crushed beer can on the floor.

HENRY:
You're having one right now.

SHAWN:
I just keep wondering, like, what if I'd made a different choice, you know, like, on a particular night, in one of these moments, who would I be now?

HENRY:
Well, I suspect that you wouldn't be you. (pats SHAWN on the back)

SHAWN sees the same photo from the yearbook on the wall. His name is written in the bottom corner: Peter Colter.

SHAWN:
Good talk, Dad. I gotta run. (opens the door but turns back) Actually, there is one more thing. Do you think I could borrow your underpants? Just for, like, ten minutes.

HENRY shakes his head and raises his hands in disbelief.

SHAWN:
Oh, come on! We're already in the car! These are... These are iconic film references I'm making tonight. (leaves)

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS watch as JULIET searches the police database. SHAWN is sitting is LASSITER'S chair playing with a small ornament from JULIET'S desk.

SHAWN:
His name is Peter Colter, Class of '95.

GUS:
Can we hurry this up? I'm due back in the gym to make my presentation.

JULIET:
If Chief Vick knew I was running names for you guys, I'd lose my ass.

SHAWN:
We definitely don't want that to happen.

JULIET:
Oh, wait! I have something. (sits)

SHAWN:
What is it?

JULIET:
(prints hard copy) Well, it's not criminal, but it's an accident report. There was an accident on June 6th, 1995.

GUS:
That was three days before graduation.

JULIET:
Peter Colter was the driver. Alcohol was involved.
He hit another vehicle head-on. A man was thrown from the car 20 feet, he was rushed to the hospital, survived in a coma for seven months and eventually died from internal injuries. Peter Colter was then charged with involuntary manslaughter and received six years' probation. But there were two other passengers in the car with him.

SHAWN:
Let me guess. Howie Tolkin and Eileen Mazwell?

JULIET:
Yeah, how'd you know that?

SHAWN:
Because I've seen Pretty in Pink, like, 75 times. (reaches over for the report)

JULIET:
Wait, wait, and here's something else. Well, it's small, but some petty theft that was out of state, shoplifting in Fallon, Nevada, which leads me to a restraining order. It was placed one month ago by Eileen Mazwell on Peter Colter.

SHAWN studies the photos from the accident. HOWIE seems to have the beginnings of a bruise on his forehead. The driver's seat had been moved back on its track.

GUS:
For what?

JULIET:
Harassment.

SHAWN:
(puts a hand to his head and stands) Peter wasn't driving the car that night. It was Howie.

JULIET stands.

GUS:
What? And he took the rap for the accident? Why?

SHAWN:
A moment and a choice, Gus. Look, Howie and Eileen killed Peter. I know it all now.

JULIET:
But no body, no crime.

SHAWN:
Seriously, Jules? That has to be on a poster around here somewhere. (looks around)

JULIET:
It's just something we say.

GUS:
Wait, so we know who the killers are and we know who they killed, but we don't have a body? Where is it?

SHAWN:
Well, if I was just some average guy without any super powers, I'd say, "I don't know. Why are you asking me?" But as head psychic of the Santa Barbara Police Department, I'd say "I don't know, why are you asking me?"

GUS:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
It's still hidden somewhere at that school!

VICK walks over to them, checking her watch. JULIET angles the computer screen so VICK can't see what they were doing. SHAWN crosses his legs and tries to look anywhere but at JULIET. GUS just turns his back.

VICK:
O'Hara, what are you doing here this late? I thought you were off tonight.

JULIET:
Yeah, you know, I was out. Stopped back by. I, you know, forgot my, Chapstick, which I now have. Yay! (uses the lip balm)

VICK:
Where were you at? Your prom?

JULIET:
Why would you say that?

VICK:
Because you're wearing a prom dress. And are you two on a case?

SHAWN:
Chief.

VICK:
Because I don't remember assigning you one. (to JULIET) What are you looking at?

LASSITER arrives.

LASSITER:
She was helping me. I just made a bust.

VICK:
And who is that?

LASSITER:
(looks over to where MINDY is getting fingerprinted) That is a real schizoid. Elizabeth Reba Davis, a.k.a. Mindy Howland, who has been filling false prescriptions under fake names since '96.

VICK:
I see. Well, good work, people. (starts to walk away) Oh, and by the way, whatever it is you're really working on, you're not being paid for this. (leaves)

JULIET:
Thank you for that, Lassiter.

LASSITER:
Yeah, sweet. Look, if you don't mind, I'm gonna get back to this. I don't want to miss the mug shots. I'm having fun. It's the best date I've been on in a long time. (leaves)

EXT. LELAND BOSSEIGH HIGH SCHOOL, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are once more at the site where COLTER'S body fell.

SHAWN:
He landed here. We know that.

GUS:
There's no other entrance they could've gotten into unless they dragged the body 200 yards all the way back to the gym.

SHAWN:
Right. (tilts head) Wait a minute.

SHAWN and GUS walk around the corner of the building and see windows at ground level.

SHAWN:
That is the girls' locker room. (pulls out Swiss Army knife and sets to work on the lock)

GUS:
Oh, now that he remembers. How would they even get a body down there anyway? That's like a 13-foot drop.

SHAWN:
(stands and puts knife away) There's only one way to find out, partner. I'm gonna ease you down, and I'll be right behind you.

GUS:
You must be out of your damn mind, Shawn. I'm not going down there first!

SHAWN:
Are you kidding me? You're gonna do this to me now after I've laid all the ground work? Now will you just get down there?

INT. LBHS, GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT

GUS is hanging from the sill. SHAWN is looking through the open window.

GUS:
I don't want to do it. Help me back up.

SHAWN:
What do you mean? You're in.

GUS:
Help me up, Shawn!

SHAWN:
All right.

SHAWN licks the palms of both hands before holding them out to help GUS. Rather than get SHAWN'S germs, GUS lets go and drops to the floor.

GUS:
(stands and looks towards the window) Okay. Now you, Shawn. Shawn?

GUS turns around to find SHAWN standing right there.

SHAWN:
Dude, I am so sorry. (holds up the keys) I didn't realize I had the keys all along.

GUS:
Let's just get to it.

SHAWN:
Okay, indeed. Let's find us a body. But first, let's both of us take a private moment to pay homage to all of the wonderful things that have occurred here over the years.

They hear a door open and duck into the shower stalls. A man and a woman pass. SHAWN and GUS peer over the top of the stall doors.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Dude, it's Howie and Eileen. That's why they haven't left the reunion. They stashed the body, but now they've got to move it.

GUS:
(whispers) Yeah, but where is it?

They exit the stalls and one of the doors bangs behind them. SHAWN and GUS duck down behind some lockers.

EILEEN:
Did you hear that?

HOWIE:
I think there's somebody in here with us.

EILEEN:
I think it came from the stalls.

HOWIE and EILEEN walk back to the stalls. SHAWN and GUS are hiding in the alcove right behind them. They crawl backwards and into a supply closet.

INT. LBHS, GIRLS' SUPPLY CLOSET, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS duck down where they can't be seen from the window in the door. HOWIE slams his hand against the window and peers inside and SHAWN and GUS cower in the corner.

HOWIE:
Nobody's there. Check the lockers. (walks away)

SHAWN looks across the room and points to the school mascot costume sitting propped against the wall. They make their way over and kneel in front of it.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Do you have a stick or a small leaf?

GUS:
(whispers) Why would I have a stick?

SHAWN pokes the head between the eyes. GUS pokes it on one side and SHAWN pokes it on the other. They then lift the head off to reveal Peter Colter's body. GUS gives a strangled scream and SHAWN covers GUS' mouth. GUS squeals until he runs out of air. SHAWN takes his hand away.

SHAWN:
(whispers) We gotta get this body to Lassiter if I'm gonna accuse them of the crime.

GUS:
(whispers) Why don't we bring Lassiter down here?

SHAWN:
(whispers) Yeah, we come back and the body's gone again? Come on!

GUS:
(whispers) If Tolkin finds us, he's gonna strangle us! He strangles people, Shawn!

SHAWN:
(whispers) Head or feet?

GUS makes a face and SHAWN challenges him with a look.

INT. LBHS, HALL, NIGHT

A couple of women are chatting by the lockers as SHAWN and GUS hurry past carrying Colter's body in the mascot costume. GUS has the feet. SHAWN backtracks to talk to the women.

SHAWN:
Shawn. (shakes hands with one of the women) Shawn Spencer. Were you girls able to get some punch?

GUS yanks him away and they continue down the hall.

INT. LBHS, GYM, NIGHT

Everyone is watching the slideshow GUS prepared. HENRY and MADDIE are also there.

HENRY:
What are you doing tomorrow?

MADDIE:
Flying to San Francisco for work. You know I'm just here for a little while.

HENRY:
Yeah, of course. I, just, I... Actually, I thought you might want to see my elementary school.

MADDIE:
You did?

HENRY:
Yeah, sure, this is... This is only half the picture.

The slideshow ends and GUS is on the stage putting on his jacket. SHAWN is behind him holding the crowns.

GUS:
Yeah! That was fun, right?

HOWIE and EILEEN hurry into the gym at the back.

GUS:
So it is now time to announce the reunion prom queen and king! Howie Tolkin!

GUS points to HOWIE and the spotlight finds him. The crowd applauds. HOWIE freezes, eyes wide.

GUS:
And his real life bride, Eileen Mazwell!

HOWIE and EILEEN try to leave.

GUS:
Where you going? Howie! Eileen! Come up here!

Realizing there is no way out, HOWIE and EILEEN make their way to the stage.

GUS:
This is exciting! (takes the crowns from SHAWN)

EILEEN and HOWIE arrive and GUS hands them the crowns.

GUS:
Congratulations.

SHAWN:
Looks like history has repeated itself.

HOWIE and EILEEN put on their crowns and sit in the thrones.

SHAWN:
Those crowns sure are heavy.

GUS:
Yes, they are.

LASSITER and JULIET arrive at the gym.

SHAWN:
Heavy with lies. You see, my fellow alumni, one of your classmates was murdered here tonight. His name was Peter Colter. Smart kid, he was a wiz at fixing cars. He was also the water boy for the football team. The reason you probably don't remember him very well is because he lived in their shadow. He worshipped them, do anything for them, including taking a rap for a tragic car accident that was actually caused by Howie. (walks around to the back of the thrones) And you let him do it because you didn't want to lose your precious scholarship. Poor Peter's life was stuck in that moment, and he never recovered. That's why he didn't show up to take his yearbook photo and that's why he moved away and ended up committing petty crimes. Meanwhile, the two of you moved on to UCLA. You married your prom queen. Probably never gave your old friend peter another thought. That is, until about a month ago. Isn't that right, Eileen? See, it's no coincidence that the restraining order that you filed against Peter just happened to coincide with Howie here announcing his candidacy in the State Assembly. Peter couldn't take it anymore. He needed the truth to come out, so he contacted you. You two did everything you could to prevent him from coming here tonight, but he came anyway. He wore his letterman's jacket with his special State Championship pin, still stuck in that one moment. [we see Peter wandering the halls and drinking a beer in auto shop] He visited all his old haunts, made a stop at the auto shop. [Peter trashes the trophy case] He got a little upset when he saw the trophy shrine built to celebrate you. Finally, he confronted you both on the roof, drunk and upset. [they argue and HOWIE pushes Peter from the roof] But you couldn't let him uncover the truth. There was way too much to lose, so you gave him one final push, silenced him once and for all.

Officers take position on the floor as LASSITER and JULIET go up on stage.

LASSITER:
Three arrests in one night. Not bad. (to SHAWN) Please tell me you have a body.

SHAWN:
It's the furry sabercat backstage.

LASSITER:
Great.

LASSITER and JULIET walk over to the thrones and LASSITER gives JULIET a set of handcuffs and the two arrest HOWIE and EILEEN.

SHAWN:
Homicide Howie, ladies and gentlemen.

SHAWN and GUS applaud as HOWIE and EILEEN are taken away by the officers. LASSITER and JULIET go back into the audience.

SHAWN:
And now I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank someone who's not only responsible for planning all of this tonight, complete with a Rastafarian theme that you all embraced so heartily, but who is also the mastermind behind the solving of tonight's crime. I know, it's true, I'm the psychic, but, often times my revelations are nothing but a cryptic mess. Tonight, for instance, all I could see were scenes from Pretty in Pink, a giant rhombus in a t-shirt that read "Soccer Moms are Easy." Now I don't know what these things mean, but Gus is somehow able to shape them into cold hard evidential facts. But that is not what makes him great. No, sir. Burton Guster has been my best friend since we were five. And maybe, just maybe, if any of you can look yourselves in the mirror and know that you've been half as good a friend to someone else as Gus has been to me, well, you too can be considered great. Give it up, for my best friend, Burton Guster.

The crowd applauds as GUS comes forward to the microphone.

MADDIE:
Oh, Henry, we must've done something right.

HENRY:
That was all you.

MADDIE:
You know that's not true.

SHAWN finds ABIGAIL on the dance floor and taps her on the shoulder. She turns around and smiles.

ABIGAIL:
I must say that was quite impressive. If you're that good of a detective, I can only imagine what sort of midwife you made.

SHAWN:
Okay, this is 13 years overdue, but here goes. I know that you think that I didn't show up the night I was supposed to meet you at the carnival, but the truth is I did. You were standing at the end of the pier. You were wearing a blue, thin-striped baby doll dress, Doc Marten sandals, black. You had a row of red butterfly clips in your hair, short jean jacket and the right pocket was ripped because you always used to shove your fist in there when you got nervous. You were pacing back and forth that night. You waited around almost an hour before you walked away. These are our tickets to the carnival. I saved them. I was so nervous, I choked. And you know what? That hardly ever happens to me. But the truth is, Abigail, I think I liked you too much. And somewhere in the back of my head, I knew what that night would mean and even how my life could be different now if I hadn't let you walk away. But this is a different moment, and it's a chance to make a different choice. And you're really amazing, and I know we can't go back in time, but I do wish that there was some way back...

ABIGAIL grabs SHAWN and kisses him passionately. The kiss ends and SHAWN picks up where he left off.

SHAWN:
So I'll just keep thinking, and if there's anything that comes to mind, I'll let you know. That was really nice.

ABIGAIL:
Pretty much perfect.

SHAWN:
Yeah. (sighs as he looks across the room to see JULIET) Pretty much perfect... So where do we go from here?

ABIGAIL:
I don't know.

SHAWN:
Maybe this is what closure feels like?

ABIGAIL:
Maybe. I guess I'll see you at the 20-year reunion.

SHAWN:
Yeah, uh... Well, knowing Gus it'll probably be our 23rd. But I'll see you there.

ABIGAIL:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Sure.

ABIGAIL:
Okay. Bye, Shawn. (puts a hand on his shoulder before leaving)

MONTAGE

Over a montage of the evening, GUS has a voice-over.

GUS:
Dear Leland Bosseigh High Administrative Board. We accept that you are withholding our deposit of $1,500 for damages. We also accept that you just see us as you want to see us: in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. A snarky psychic, an uptight pharmaceuticals salesman, a pretty female blonde detective, and a not so pretty, unusually lanky detective. But each of us is all of those things. Plus our normal fee for solving a murder in one meaningful evening is twice that. So enclosed is a bill for $3,000.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are strolling along the field towards the goalpost. SHAWN is dressed like Judd Nelson in "The Breakfast Club". GUS' voice-over continues.

GUS:
Please remit payment in the form of a check made out simply to "Psych."

Episode 3x03 Daredevils!

1987

EXT. ROAD, DAY

Kids are lined along the road chanting Shawn's name and pumping their arms. A young BOY is standing by a ramp with a walkie-talkie.

BOY:
(into walkie) Shawn, this'll never work. I've done the math. The ramp's too short. You'll have to let me duck.

At the opposite end of the road from the BOY, SHAWN is on his bicycle wearing a towel over his shoulders like a cape. He also has on HENRY'S police helmet. He lowers the visor and begins to pedal. The kids continue to chant.

BOY:
(into walkie) Shawn! Shawn! Shawn, stop! Abort. Abort. Abort! Oh, crap.

HENRY grabs SHAWN and the bike continues up the ramp. His audience runs away.

HENRY:
(picks up helmet) What the hell do you think you're doing, Shawn?!

SHAWN:
(angry) Dad, you ruined everything!

HENRY:
Of all the boneheaded stunts you've pulled in your life, this is without a doubt the dumbest. Shawn, what in the name of everything that's holy would possess you to do something so incredibly stupid?

SHAWN:
All the kids from my class wanted to see me do it. See?

No one else is there.

HENRY:
No, see what, Shawn? Come here. Listen to me. (kneels and puts a hand on SHAWN'S shoulder)  You think your fans came out here to see you make this jump?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

HENRY:
They came out here to see you crack your head open. Which basically makes you no different than the kid in class who can shoot milk out of his eye.

SHAWN:
(excited) Do you think I could be as popular as him?

HENRY stands and walks away.

PRESENT DAY

INT. STADIUM, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are at an arena in town walking to their seats with snacks.

GUS:
I can't believe you did this, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Apparently you're unaware that some churros have more nutrients than carrots. 12 more of these, I'll have my RDA of riboflavin.

GUS:
No, I mean accepting tickets to some ridiculous tractor pull as payment for a case.

SHAWN:
Gus, (to woman as they take their seats) excuse us - when your clients are carnie folk, it's this or 20 rides on a rusted Tilt-a-Whirl. And I remember the last time you got on one of those.

GUS:
You know I had early onset vertigo.

SHAWN:
The important thing is that Wolf Boy and his gold teeth have been reunited.

SHAWN reaches for GUS'S snacks and GUS slaps him.

GUS:
Don't play, Shawn.

ANNOUNCER:
(over loudspeaker) Ladies and gentlemen, please give a huge Santa Barbara welcome to our opening act. Put your hands together for the heart-stopping, gravity-mystifying, death-defying, Dutch "The Clutch" Jenkins!

An older man with long greying hair steps out to greet the audience. He is wearing a blue suit with red lapels with silver stars. The audience claps. SHAWN is surprised to see him. GUS has no idea who the man is. DUTCH gets on his motorcycle.

SHAWN:
I can't believe it, dude. It's Dutch the Clutch.

GUS:
What, you know that guy?

SHAWN:
Dude, you don't remember Dutch the Clutch? He was on That's Incredible once when we were kids. And he jumped Springfield Gorge.

GUS:
That was Homer Simpson.

ANNOUNCER:
(over loudspeaker) Dutch will attempt to launch himself through the ring of fire and land safely on the other side. But for the first time ever, Dutch will attempt this stunt without the benefit of his sight!

Two crew members come out to help with the blindfold and his helmet.

GUS:
That guy is crazy.

SHAWN:
Crazy awesome.

DUTCH starts the engine as confetti falls and lights come on along the ramp.

ANNOUNCER:
(over loudspeaker) Here we go, folks. Hold on to your seats!

They light the ring on fire. DUTCH slaps his helmet twice and accelerates onto the ramp, flames coming out of the exhaust. As he's in the air approaching the ring, SHAWN sees gas leaking from the tank. DUTCH goes through the ring and the tank explodes and DUTCH falls off the bike. Some of the audience stands and applauds, thinking it part of the act. DUTCH rolls down the ramp and that's when people gasp. Two of his crew rush over, calling for a medic. Two paramedics hurry over with a gurney.

ANNOUNCER:
(over loudspeaker) Everyone, please remain calm.

Two firemen use extinguishers on the bike and DUTCH. SHAWN and GUS exchange looks, not knowing what's going on. DUTCH then stands with some assistance. He then pushes them away, takes off his helmet, puts his arms out wide.

DUTCH:
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

The audience cheers and applauds like crazy.

ANNOUNCER:
(over loudspeaker) He's okay! Everyone, show your appreciation for a true American hero, Dutch the Clutch Jenkins!

A young woman runs up to DUTCH and hugs him followed by his crew.

GUS:
That was insane.

SHAWN:
No. That was attempted murder. (takes a bite of his churro)

EXT. CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk past some booths.

SHAWN:
Dutch! Dutch the Clutch! You honestly don't remember him?

GUS:
No. Why is this such a big deal for you?

SHAWN:
Gus, guys like me and him are cut from the same cloth, okay? We cast aside the rules of society. We laugh in the face of danger. We ignore the tiny voice in our head that tells us not to do stuff.

GUS:
The tiny voice in my head says, "There's a reason I'm the only black person here."

SHAWN:
I'm telling you, man, someone tried to kill him. Take it from a fellow motorcycle guy.

GUS:
Please, what was the last repair you did to your bike?

WOMAN:
Can you get that?

GUS picks up a basketball that escaped one of the games and throws it, missing completely.

SHAWN:
Does adding a sticker count? Regardless, fuel lines do not randomly spring leaks. There's a killer out there, and he or she failed. So, they're bound to try again.

GUS:
How the hell are we supposed to protect someone who straps himself to a rocket-powered bike and sails through a wall of fire?

SHAWN:
I'm working on it.

They are stopped by a tall muscular man.

MAN:
Can I help you?

SHAWN:
Yes, I'm Shawn Spencer, police psychic, amateur daredevil, denture-wearer and strawberry crepe enthusiast.

MAN:
You're not on the list.

SHAWN:
List? Dude, they're about to start racing ocelots in half an hour. There's no way you have a velvet rope here.

GUS:
Let's go, Shawn.

SHAWN:
No, no, no. I'm here to tell you that something was off with Dutch's last stunt. He is in danger and I sense foul play. It's both a daredevil and a psychic thing. You'll just have to trust me.

As SHAWN is talking, a YOUNG MAN in the background listens.

MAN:
Sir, I want you to turn around and get the hell out of...

YOUNG MAN:
(to MAN) Hey, give me a sec with these guys, yeah? (puts an arm over each of their shoulders and walks them away) I'm Lewis. Dutch is my dad.

SHAWN:
Ah!

LEWIS:
So, uh, what the hell do you mean by foul play?

GUS:
We're private investigators. He's a psychic.

SHAWN:
You left out the daredevil part.

GUS:
And that's why he knows the stunt was tampered with.

LEWIS:
A psychic, huh? I don't know about that sort of thing, but, uh, you might be on to something. My dad's last two stunts didn't go off right either. And I have been noticing some weird things lately.

SHAWN:
Well, you're lucky. We're in the business of weird.

LEWIS:
(looks SHAWN over) What would you need for me to hire you?

GUS:
A retainer check for $2.000.

SHAWN:
(talks over GUS) Dutch's autograph.

GUS shoves SHAWN in the back.

SHAWN:
Man, I will punch you in the knee.

GUS:
(raises his knee) Go ahead, I dare... aah! (cries out after SHAWN slaps him)

LEWIS:
Look, guys, money's a little tight right now. Last month we shared the bill with Yippy the hiccupping terrier.

GUS:
He's still hiccupping?

SHAWN:
Dude, you know that, but you don't know who Dutch the Clutch is?

GUS:
He's been hiccupping for nine years, Shawn. It's a canine record.

LEWIS:
Hey! Guys, please. Look, no offense, but my dad's not gonna let some psychic guy hang around him. His circle's air-tight. But we'll work something out. Come on. There's an after party. Let's go.

LEWIS puts his arms around their shoulders again and leads them backstage.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER signs a form for a WOMAN.

LASSITER:
Okay.

WOMAN:
Thanks.

JULIET enters seeming chipper.

JULIET:
You ready? Interrogation Room A.

LASSITER:
Great. (puts on suit jacket)

JULIET:
So?

LASSITER:
So what?

JULIET:
Your date Friday night. Details! What happened?

LASSITER:
Well, we ordered the crab cakes.

JULIET:
Mmm.

LASSITER:
(straightens tie) And she went to the bathroom and didn't come back.

JULIET gasps.

LASSITER:
So, either it went badly or she's still in the bathroom.

JULIET:
Oh, Carlton, I'm sorry.

LASSITER makes a non-committal sound and heads for the door.

JULIET:
(realizes what went wrong and follows) You told the dead clown story, didn't you?

LASSITER:
What? That is a funny story.

JULIET:
Clowns are funny. Stories about them being shot to death, not so much. Please tell me you didn't draw a diagram of the bullet holes.

LASSITER:
Well, there were crayons on the table. What was I supposed to do?

JULIET:
You took her to a restaurant that had crayons on the table?

LASSITER:
(puts his hands on her shoulders) Thank you for your concern. I am fine. (goes down the stairs) Interrogation Room A, right?

JULIET:
Yes.

EXT. BEACHSIDE BAR, DAY

As LEWIS leads SHAWN and GUS to the deck where the party is happening, DUTCH'S AGENT is on the phone. Loud rock music is playing.

AGENT:
What do I sound like? An agent in the Valley? This is Dutch the Clutch. What are you, deaf? He doesn't get out of bed for less than two grand. 3,500. 3,500, that's it. That's it.

SHAWN:
Wow. You know, The Allman brothers generally tend to inhibit my psychic powers. So, why don't you just tell me, is there anyone that'd like to see your dad bite the bullet?

LEWIS:
Just about everybody that comes to the show.

GUS:
Anyone in here in particular have a grudge with him?

LEWIS:
Against my dad?

GUS:
Yeah.

LEWIS:
No way. Everybody here loves him. Can't understand why anyone would want to hurt him. In fact, I've been trying to get him to retire altogether. (takes them to the bar)

SHAWN:
Why doesn't he listen?

LEWIS:
Give up the spotlight? Give up the applause? The love? Never. Besides, well...

GUS:
Oh, no. (refuses the beer)

LEWIS:
...my dad thinks he's unkillable. But he's wrong. He's flesh and blood. My flesh and blood. That's why I'm counting on you boys. Okay, let me... let me introduce you to my dad. (leads them away)

GUS:
Do we have our cover stories yet?

LEWIS:
Don't worry, I take care of all the finances and hirings. Pop, found us the two new Diehards you asked for.

DUTCH is sitting at a table with the same woman who hugged him after the accident. LEWIS sits down at the table.

DUTCH:
Damn, already?

SHAWN:
Actually, I'm Die Hard. He's Die Harder. We have two other guys in our crew, but they aren't nearly as good as us.

DUTCH:
Well, how the hell you do that so quick? Especially after what happened to that last bunch.

GUS:
Excuse me, what happened to the last bunch?

DUTCH:
Well, we can't talk about it for legal reasons. All I know is our attorney said that it ain't decapitation if the head don't come off all the way. (laughs) I joke, I joke!

GUS:
He better be.

SHAWN:
That's morbid!

The younger woman who was laughing with DUTCH reaches out her hand and introduces herself.

VIKI:
Hi, I'm Viki, Dutch's wife. Now you boys have experience, right? It's up to you to keep my man safe.

DUTCH:
That's right. Hey, what's the most dangerous thing you boys done?

SHAWN:
We eat at Taco John's with some frequency. So that puts us right there on the edge.

DUTCH:
Oh, we got ourselves a couple of comedians.  (laughs) I like that! Okay, you boys got the job... (slams his fist on the table) Oh, damn!

GUS:
Did you just break your wrist?

DUTCH:
Yeah, well, it's okay. Nothing busted through the skin.

LEWIS:
Dad, maybe you should take a break. I mean, you almost got killed today.

DUTCH:
Oh, come on, son. You just worry about your own safety. I'll be fine.

VIKI:
Well, maybe Lewis is right. And we can finally take that vacation to Dollywood!

GUS:
Uh, not to overstep, but I think you may still have a concussion from earlier.

DUTCH:
Concussion? (stands) Hell, I've had a concussion since 1982. True story. (to everyone) Anybody else's beer taste like metal? (lifts his beer with a whoop)

An ad comes on the TV at the bar for another daredevil.

TV ANNOUNCER:
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday...

DUTCH:
(walks to the TV) Who the hell put that on there?!

GUS:
Okay, did we miss something?

LEWIS:
Hell, that's El Diablo.

SHAWN:
What is an El Diablo?

LEWIS:
He's nobody. Just some wannabe daredevil. No one knows who he is because he always wears a mask.

DUTCH:
Right there! (points at TV) See that right there? That's why we can't take no damn vacation. That son of a bitch is right on my heels.

LEWIS:
Relax, Dad. He's amateur hour compared to you.

The AGENT joins them.

AGENT:
Dutch, forget about El Diablo. I got you that canyon jump in September.

DUTCH:
Rock on, Manny!

They shake hands and DUTCH cries out in pain.

MANNY:
I told you, Clutch. Explosions. Crashes. That's what people pay to see. You keep that up, I'm gonna get you on TV. And it won't be that infomercial for the home stomach pump. This is gonna be one of those rain delay filler shows.

They chuckle. LEWIS stands and walks to them.

LEWIS:
Dad, please. It's too soon to be adding new stunts.

DUTCH:
Oh, bull piss! Ain't nobody telling me I can't do anything no more.

GUS:
I think that was the worst English I've ever heard.

DUTCH climbs up onto one of the tables near the railing still holding his beer.

DUTCH:
All right! $200 that I'm gonna take a fall!

MANNY:
$300!

DUTCH:
(auctioning as crowd gathers) 300! 350! 400! 450! 550! 650!

DUTCH falls backwards over the railing. SHAWN and GUS rush over to see that he has landed on a pile of garbage bags.

DUTCH:
Glen Campbell rocks! Oh, damn. I spilled my beer. (laughs)

SHAWN:
It might be harder to keep this guy alive than I thought.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

JULIET enters the office.

JULIET:
You need me, Chief?

VICK:
(seated at desk) Why is someone lodging a complaint against my head detective? That's the third one this month.

JULIET:
He's just going through a rough patch right now. He'll be fine. I think he's having some serious dating problems.

VICK:
Oh. (stands and walks to small fridge for water) You know, when I used to work vice, my partner was an alcoholic. And one night I went over to his house, handcuffed him to a radiator and made him dry out. And when he finally sobered up, I gave him a choice. Go into department rehab program or chew your hand off for freedom. He chose the program.

JULIET:
Is that a real story?

VICK:
Maybe it is. Maybe I saw it on an old Police Woman rerun. The point is, O'Hara, sometimes it's up to the cop's partner to keep their head above water, huh? To do what's necessary to make sure that they stay on course. Get me?

JULIET:
Yes, Chief. (exits)

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

JULIET doesn't know what to make of the advice she was just given. BUZZ meets her.

BUZZ:
(gives JULIET phone message) Hmm, this is for you. What's wrong?

JULIET:
The Chief just gave me some really weird advice.

BUZZ:
Well, what does she want?

JULIET:
Well, I can't be sure, but I think she wants me to find Lassiter a girlfriend.

BUZZ:
(makes a face) Good luck with that.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

GUS is on the phone while at his desk.

GUS:
That makes sense, I guess. Thanks, Lewis.  (ends call) So, Dutch doesn't have a will because apparently invincible people do not need them.

SHAWN sets a box on the desk and takes out a large sheaf of papers, handing it to GUS before taking some to his own desk.

GUS:
What is all this?

SHAWN:
Those are forms that must be filled out so that we can be Die Hards. Just sign them.

GUS:
These release the employer from any liability in case the stunt tester is torn to shreds? Stunt tester? Is that what we're doing? Are you crazy?

SHAWN:
Trust me and be cool. (signs form)

GUS:
Wait, this one is in case we're accidentally chewed to death by a malfunctioning robot? Oh, hell no!

SHAWN:
Relax, we'll be fine.

GUS:
(reads through pages) Deboned? Killed and re-killed? How does that even work?

SHAWN:
(goes to pinball machine) Gus, don't be an old sponge with hair hanging off it. I'm all over this case.

GUS:
Mimed to death?

SHAWN:
That's clearly a typo. They meant "maimed." What, are we gonna be killed by Marcel Marceau?

GUS:
Marcel Marceau is dead.

SHAWN:
See, there's nothing to worry about.

GUS:
(walks over) We are solving this case, Shawn, before we have to do any of this stuff.

SHAWN:
Fair. I've been checking out this El Diablo guy. He always rolls into town the day after Dutch. And they've been competing for the same gigs for almost a year. Including that canyon jump that Dutch just got.

GUS:
All right, motive. Wipe out Dutch and the field is clear. And El Diablo is a daredevil so he would know how to sabotage the stunts to make it look like an accident.

SHAWN:
I'll buy that.

GUS:
And someone at the party told me that El Diablo performed at the fair the night before Dutch, when Dutch's team was, no doubt, prepping for their stunt.

SHAWN:
You're saying they had access to Dutch's equipment.

GUS:
I'm sold. He's our guy. So where is he? Where do we find this El Diablo?

SHAWN:
How do you feel about checking out some old antique motorcycles?

EXT. MOTORCYCLE SHOW, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk around the few tents set up.

SHAWN:
They call this a motorcycle show? There's, like, four motorcycles here. They don't even have the bike from Blue Thunder.

GUS:
That was a helicopter.

SHAWN:
You're right. I was thinking of Blue Lagoon.

GUS:
There wasn't a bike in Blue Lagoon.

SHAWN:
How'd they get off the island, Gus?

EL DIABLO is signing autographs in full racing gear.

SHAWN:
Yo, El Diablo! What's up, man? Shawn Spencer, this is my partner, Squirts Macintosh. Just have a couple sort of serious questions for you.

EL DIABLO turns to mount his bike.

SHAWN:
Oh, no, no, no, you don't have to get on the bike.

EL DIABLO revs his bike then takes off, forcing SHAWN and GUS to move out of the way.

SHAWN:
Dude, he's running. International sign of guilt. Let's go! Quick.

They run to a vintage motorcycle with a sidecar. SHAWN puts on a leather jacket.

SHAWN:
Get in the sidecar.

GUS:
Are you out of your damn mind? I'm not getting in that thing. You get in there.

SHAWN:
Gus, you have absolutely no idea how to drive a motorcycle. Get in the sidecar. (zips up the jacket and puts on gloves)

GUS gets in the sidecar and they both put on helmets and goggles. SHAWN looks at his reflection.

SHAWN:
Dude, it's like High Road to China.

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
We're going, we're going.

SHAWN revs the engine and takes off, leaving GUS behind, coughing the exhaust.

EXT. PARK, DAY

EL DIABLO races through the park, scaring pedestrians. SHAWN chases him and begins to gain when EL DIABLO has engine trouble. SHAWN passes him and blocks the trail, causing EL DIABLO to swerve and crash, his helmet coming off. SHAWN takes off his helmet and hurries over, grabbing EL DIABLO as he starts to get up. He pulls off the headcover to reveal LEWIS.

SHAWN:
Lewis? You're El Diablo?

GUS arrives on a tiny putt-putt motorcycle.

GUS:
Lewis?!

SHAWN:
That is the sexiest thing I've ever seen.

GUS:
Shut up, Shawn. (stands and heads over to the others) You're guilty of attempted patricide.

SHAWN:
And you tried to kill your own dad. (throws headcover at him)

LEWIS:
I never tried to kill anyone. You really think I'd hire detectives if I wanted to bump off my own dad? What kind of psychic are you?

SHAWN:
The kind that loves bees and historical novels. The kind that knows a lie when he hears one.

GUS:
And knows that only the guilty make a run for it.

LEWIS:
The only thing I am guilty of is not telling my dad that I do this too. And I ran because I don't want you two exposing my secret.

SHAWN:
Why hide it?

LEWIS:
My dad forbids me from being a daredevil because he didn't want me to get hurt. Do you know what it's like to have your father tell you not to follow in his footsteps?

SHAWN:
I wish.

LEWIS:
(picks up helmet) I did this because I care about my dad. As soon as El Diablo starts making some noise and he knows I'm legit, then I'll tell him. (picks up bike) Then maybe he'll let me take over the family business and finally retire. Hopefully before he gets really hurt.

SHAWN looks closely at the motorcycle and sees that LEWIS painted over the name "Vicki" - the name that is on DUTCH'S current bike.

SHAWN:
Whoa! Psychic vision! Incoming! I see colors. On your hands. On your bike. On your hands. My daughter... My sister... My Father the Hero.

LEWIS:
Yeah, I repainted my bike recently. I had paint on my hands.

SHAWN:
Repainted why? Because you stole it from your dad?

LEWIS:
I borrowed it. Dad was supposed to use this in the last jump but Manny got us a sponsor and a new bike. Tech specs said the new bike was way safer. Left this one for me.

SHAWN:
Who the hell is Manny?

GUS:
The agent.

SHAWN:
Oh.

LEWIS:
Look, you guys aren't gonna tell him who I am, right?

SHAWN:
Mmm (picks up LEWIS' helmet)

LEWIS:
It's a sensitive subject. He won't understand it right away. I just want him to come to grips with... This is what I am. I didn't choose it.

SHAWN:
Yeah. (hands LEWIS his helmet) I had a similar experience with my dad when I told him I wanted to take Gus here to the prom. (laughs)  Come on, you and me at the prom? No? Misfire? Okay.

EXT. PARK, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are walking to the car.

SHAWN:
So the exploding motorcycle was provided at the last minute by Dutch's agent Manny. Who probably slapped those sponsor decals on himself. I'd say that warrants investigation.

GUS:
Doesn't make sense. Why would an agent risk his client's life? Isn't that his money train?

SHAWN:
Remember the after party?

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

MANNY:
I told you, Clutch, Explosions, crashes. That's what people pay to see.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

SHAWN:
Manny may not be trying to kill Dutch.

They get into the car.

GUS:
But he's making the stunts more dangerous to add a little pizzazz to Dutch's act.

SHAWN:
Which in turn gets Dutch more gigs!

GUS:
Which in turn is only increasing Manny's 10%.

SHAWN:
Which in turn makes me wonder why you would use the word "pizzazz".

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is watching all the women as they passed by, assessing them for girlfriend material. SHAWN and GUS come up behind her.

GUS:
What are you doing?

SHAWN:
I'll give you an A-plus for the skulking, but a C-minus for the leering.

JULIET:
I have to find Lassiter a date for the weekend. I've narrowed it down to three prospective candidates.

SHAWN:
Jules, why would you possibly want to jump into that snake pit?

JULIET:
Vick ordered me to.

SHAWN:
All right. Would you like me to give your candidates the psychic once over?

JULIET:
(stands) If you have to.

SHAWN:
I'm sensing it'll be easier to get a stranger to go out with him than someone he works with.

GUS:
Or knows him.

SHAWN:
Or has ever had a conversation with him.

GUS:
Or he hasn't shot.

SHAWN:
One more question. Are we locked into the same species?

JULIET:
Enough already. What are you guys doing here?

GUS:
We need a background check on Manny Robertson.

JULIET:
Oh, I know that name. Yeah, we've had him in here a few times on some get-rich-quick scams. Why him?

SHAWN:
I'm getting a very strong vibe off him on this awesome daredevils case we're working.

JULIET:
(laughs) Daredevils, really? They're still around?

SHAWN:
Don't... don't do that. Don't hate on the devils.

JULIET:
I just... I-I never got it personally. I mean, "Ooh, I can jump over a flaming trashcan." I mean, why do people care?

GUS:
Allow me. (does his "cool" rubbing his nose with his thumb)

GUS takes two straight-backed chairs and places them side-by-side in the hall.

JULIET:
What is he doing?

SHAWN:
Wait for it.

GUS takes a few steps back and eyes the chairs before getting down into starting position.

SHAWN:
Wait for it!

GUS then runs and jumps over the chairs.

SHAWN:
(applauds) What's up?

Others join in clapping.

ALL:
Gus! Gus! Gus!

Sometime later there are six chairs lined up and a crowd has gathered to watch. JULIET looks at SHAWN who nods. GUS then gives advice to BUZZ who runs and makes the leap, only to have his foot get caught on the last chair. He wipes out. GUS groans in sympathy.

SHAWN:
Ow.

BUZZ:
(gets up) I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

SHAWN:
Need any more proof?

JULIET:
No, I got it.

Everyone walks away, spell broken.

BUZZ:
I'm...I'm fine.

EXT. DUTCH'S HQ, DAY

SHAWN and GUS drive up ready to confront MANNY.

GUS:
We need to find Manny as soon as possible.

SHAWN:
We should have a little breathing room, actually. If Manny's our mad saboteur, he won't strike until he has an audience.

GUS:
During the actual stunt. Not during rehearsal.

SHAWN:
Exactly.

At this point, DUTCH comes peeling into the lot.

SHAWN:
Next stunt's tomorrow. (gets out of the car) A jump, closing night of the fair. Dutch should be safe till then. Clutch!

SHAWN and GUS raise their hands in greeting and witness DUTCH'S car explode. They cough from the smoke.

SHAWN:
Or not.

DUTCH gets out of the car coughing and bends over.

SHAWN:
Holy...

SHAWN and GUS hurry over to DUTCH.

GUS:
Are you all right?

DUTCH:
(straightens) What?!

GUS:
(loud) Are you all right? Should we call the cops or the ambulance?

DUTCH:
What the hell for? I've done that stunt a thousand times. That was just a rehearsal.

Four people come out and use fire extinguishers on the car.

DUTCH:
Now it's your turn. Come on, I got you set up over at the stadium.

SHAWN and GUS look at each other as DUTCH walks away. SHAWN smiles and follows.

INT. STADIUM, BACKSTAGE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS follow DUTCH.

SHAWN:
You know, Dutch, seeing as how Gus and I are just getting started, we've a couple questions about representation. Namely, your agent Manny.

DUTCH:
First we rehearse. Then I gotta strip Viki down and oil her joints.

GUS:
Wow, not too shy about your wife, are you?

DUTCH:
I'm talking about my bikes. I name 'em all after my wife.

GUS:
Maybe we could just talk to Manny himself. Whereabouts is he?

DUTCH:
I'll call him later, after I give Viki a lube job and pull her nuts. Hey, guys, come on! We gotta get ready for that catapult stunt! (walks off)

A CREW member comes over with two bodysuits.

CREW:
You boys ready to work? Strip and put these on.

Some time later, SHAWN and GUS have changed into the suits and are standing in a baby pool. The same CREW member comes over and makes sure that the suits are done properly.

CREW:
All right, this one's easy. All you gotta do is stand here. (walks away)

GUS:
How the hell are we supposed to help Dutch when we're stuck doing this stuff?

SHAWN:
As long as we're making sure the stunts are safe, he can't get killed.

GUS:
I'll make it safe for me outside.

SHAWN:
You need to man up.

The CREW member returns and hands them head-covering masks.

CREW:
I'd put these masks on if I was you.

SHAWN:
What for?

Another crew member starts spraying them with liquid from a cannister.

GUS:
What is this, an underwater stunt or something? Wait, is that gasoline?

The CREW member starts up a flamethrower and SHAWN and GUS scream like girls and jump out of the pool.

GUS:
You must be out of your damn mind!

CREW:
(turns off the flamethrower) Well, we had to see how fire retardant these suits were.

GUS:
You didn't know that before you tried to set us on fire?

SHAWN pats GUS down and GUS slaps his off.

CREW:
What do you think you're getting paid for?

At that moment MANNY drives up honking the horn.

MANNY:
Dutch, Dutch! Great news, baby. Apparently some crazy fan ran El Diablo off the road at the classic bike show and he injured his shoulder. He can't do the clock tower death drop stunt and I got it for you.

DUTCH:
Rock on, Manny!

They high-five and DUTCH grips his hand in pain.

CREW:
All right, we're gonna have to rig these two up and drop 'em off the building first.

SHAWN raises his hand to say something.

MANNY:
No, no, no time to rehearse.

GUS:
Thank you, Lord.

MANNY:
The time of the event was already advertised. If we want it, we gotta do it now. You up for it, Dutch?

DUTCH:
What, are you kidding? (climbs into the back seat and around to the front) Hell, one time I bungee jumped off a building twice as high as that tower. And even though the bungee cord snapped on the way down, I still made it to the George Thorogood concert that night. True story. Yeehaw!

MANNY:
Yes, sir! We're gonna make some money, Dutch.

MANNY and DUTCH drive away.

GUS:
No rehearsal? That's convenient. Manny's rushing Dutch into another stunt unprepared.

SHAWN:
Another stunt. Another chance for sabotage.

EXT. TOP OF CLOCK TOWER, DAY

SHAWN and GUS look out over the side of the tower. There is a small tent where DUTCH is getting ready. There is also a camera crew.

GUS:
What is going on?

SHAWN:
Apparently Dutch is going to jump from the building, spread his arms, and glide down to that large pillow, all live on camera for some daredevil web site.

VIKI opens the curtains with a flourish and poses for the cameras. DUTCH then steps out wearing his suit and also poses.

DUTCH:
Red!

SHAWN and GUS turn away to face him and sigh. They watch as RED, the crew member from earlier, helps adjust the stunt suit. He is wearing a jacket advertising Dunkin' Donuts.

SHAWN:
You see that?

GUS:
Yes. Now I'm in the mood for some coffee.

SHAWN:
What are you talking about?

GUS:
Coffee, Shawn.

SHAWN:
What are you looking at?

GUS:
The same thing you're looking at.

SHAWN:
It's a Dunkin' Donuts patch, Gus.

GUS:
And they have excellent coffee. They have one on my extended route.

SHAWN:
You know what, dude? You astound me. And now I must have a blueberry crumb. It's totally triggered my donut launch sequence.

GUS:
Will you focus, Shawn?

SHAWN:
I can't.

SHAWN looks over and sees MANNY whispering in DUTCH'S ear. DUTCH then mounts the steps by the edge and hold out his arms to his sides, showing his paneled red, white & blue cape. He knocks on his head with his fist a couple of times and prepares to jump. SHAWN then sees a hastily sewn seam attaching two panels.

SHAWN:
No, don't jump!

SHAWN grabs DUTCH by the waist to pull him away from the edge but the momentum sends them over, screaming. Everyone runs over to see that DUTCH his holding onto the ledge and SHAWN is holding onto him.

MANNY:
Jeez!

DUTCH:
What the hell's wrong with you?

MANNY:
Everything's wrecked now. (reaches down to help pull up DUTCH)

VIKI:
Are you all right, baby?

SHAWN:
Gus! A little help!

GUS:
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

GUS pulls SHAWN up while MANNY and LEWIS help DUTCH.

VIKI:
(hits SHAWN on the back) You could've killed my husband, you idiot!

MANNY:
Gotcha!

DUTCH is safely back on the tower.

SHAWN:
Idiot? How about mind-blowing genius? Dutch, please. Spread your arms the way you would in the middle of the stunt.

DUTCH:
I don't take orders from nimrods like you.

VIKI:
Dutch, do it. Do it!

DUTCH does so and the cape rips at the seam. He realizes that he could have died. VIKI gasps.

SHAWN:
If you would've jumped, you would've died.

INT. DUTCH'S TRAILER, DAY

Everyone is inside and DUTCH is pissed at SHAWN.

DUTCH:
What the hell kind of stunt was that you tried to pull out there? Nobody steals my spotlight! Nobody! You're just damn lucky Manny pulled me off that roof before I got a chance to throw you off it!

SHAWN:
Dutch, I'm gonna level with you. We're not really professional stuntmen.

GUS:
No.

DUTCH:
Now that'd explain all the screaming. So what the hell's going on?

GUS:
Uh, we're, um, uh...

SHAWN:
Animal activists!

GUS:
Right.

SHAWN:
And that is the truth. We are here to stop you from abusing any more large impressive exotic game in your act. Shame on you, Dutch the Clutch.

DUTCH:
I ain't got no animals in my act!

SHAWN:
Well, that settles that. Gus and I will be going.

GUS and SHAWN stand and try to leave.

DUTCH:
Sit down!

They sit.

DUTCH:
Now the next thing that comes out of your mouth better be the truth. Otherwise we're gonna start rehearsing that "bury you alive" stunt.

GUS:
(stands) We're detectives. He's a psychic. We were hired by your son.

LEWIS:
Look, Dad, I can explain.

DUTCH:
I'm a Christian man! What the hell are you trying to do getting me all mixed up in that voodoo dark force stuff?

GUS:
He... We think that someone is trying to sabotage your stunts.

LEWIS:
Let's just hear 'em out. Have you guys found anything?

GUS:
Yes, we think that it's your...

SHAWN:
(interrupts) We're not sure who it is yet, exactly. (stands)

DUTCH:
That's because nobody's trying to kill me. News flash! Almost dying's par for the course for my line of work.

SHAWN:
(puts hand to head) Dutch, someone tampered with that gliding suit. The spirits are sure of it.

DUTCH:
That gliding suit tore because I bought it during the gliding suit boom in 1977. And that fall wouldn't have killed me! Damn, one time I jumped out a blimp 500 feet in the sky. Had a heart attack on the way down. Two hours later, I was eating a BLT in Red Robin. True story!

SHAWN:
Dutch, please listen to us.

DUTCH:
No! You listen to me because I'm only gonna say it one time. You're fired! Red, help these boys out.

RED grabs SHAWN by the shoulder.

GUS:
Wait a second. Whoa, Red! Whoa!

SHAWN sees a tattoo on RED'S arm that says "Vikings". RED pushes him towards the door.

SHAWN:
Huh, so we're not gonna shoot Gus out of a cannon later? No?

EXT. DUTCH'S TRAILER, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are thrown out.

SHAWN:
Okay, okay.

They look back at the trailer questioningly.

INT. CAR, NIGHT

JULIET and LASSITER are on a stakeout. LASSITER is taking photos.

LASSITER:
There's something I love about these low-rent stakeouts. All you gotta do is snap some pictures of a guy with some stolen merchandise.

JULIET:
Why didn't you wear the burgundy turtleneck?

LASSITER:
Because it didn't occur to me to change for a stakeout. Why?

JULIET:
No reason. I just... I really like you in that burgundy turtleneck. And with short hair. And you know what else? A little cologne wouldn't kill you.

LASSITER:
All right, you think I don't know what's going on here. Look, I've noticed you kind of checking me out at the squad and asking about my dating habits.

JULIET:
It's not a big deal. It's just...

LASSITER:
Listen, it is perfectly normal for a junior officer to develop feelings for her superior, someone she feels is a mentor and...

JULIET:
Oh, no! (laughs) No, no! Oh, my God, no.

LASSITER:
O'Hara, it's okay.

JULIET:
No, no, Vick ordered me to find you a girlfriend.

LASSITER:
What?

JULIET:
Yeah. You know, we've noticed that you've been on edge lately. And thought it might help. And I have this friend you can meet later who likes cops...

LASSITER:
I don't believe this. That's a total invasion of my privacy, not to mention unprofessional. And so what? I sleep alone. So what if I saw a frozen dinner in half before I microwave it every night? So what if I seriously considered planting evidence on my wife's new boyfriend? I mean, that's... It's just... Oh, God. I may need your help.

JULIET:
That's all I want to do. (checks phone) Oh, damn, I'm not getting a signal. All right, I'm gonna go find a hot spot and then when I get back, I'll tell you all about my friend. (leaves)

INT. PSYCH, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS enter.

GUS:
Why didn't you tell them about Manny?

SHAWN:
Because it's not him. When Manny was adjusting Dutch's suit before the stunt he whispered something in his ear. I, of course, read his lips. He said he didn't want him wearing that gliding suit. He wanted him to wear the black one because it was far more slimming. And then he said, "Purple camel lawn mower, man."

As he is talking, SHAWN takes two cans out of the fridge. GUS takes one as SHAWN puts the other away. After GUS opens the can, SHAWN takes it and drinks from it.

GUS:
How the hell are we supposed to help Dutch now that we've been banished?

SHAWN:
I'm gonna go over there and start working on it. (walks away and leaves fridge open)

GUS:
You're wasting energy, Shawn. Do you see solar panels up in here? (takes a can from fridge before closing it)

INT, STADIUM, BACKSTAGE, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are with LEWIS.

LEWIS:
Come on, now, you guys gotta hurry. The next stunt is coming up fast. Dad'll kill me if he finds out I let you back in here.

SHAWN:
Don't worry, Lewis. We'll be as nonexistent as an Aldo Nova fan.

LEWIS opens a door and lets them into the area where they test stunts.

GUS:
So, what are we looking for?

SHAWN:
Red. When he gave us the heave-ho, I saw an old tattoo on his arm. First four letters spelled "Viki" but in a slightly different font from the rest.

GUS:
So?

SHAWN:
So he was probably seeing her before she married Dutch. Right? She leaves him, he gets a different tattoo artist to add the "n-g-s" to conceal it from his boss.

GUS:
Maybe Red's trying to eliminate the competition.

SHAWN:
Bingo.

They see RED wheeling out one of DUTCH'S motorcycles. He's acting a little cagey. They follow, staying out of sight. They stop near a machine with snacks. SHAWN twists the dial to take food without taking his eyes off RED.

GUS:
Let me go first. I'm more stealthy.

SHAWN:
In your dreams.

GUS:
I'm as graceful as a gazelle, Shawn.

SHAWN:
You are not.

GUS:
A jackal.

SHAWN:
Dude, a jackal is not graceful. It's like a rabid, vicious badger.

SHAWN holds out his hand and GUS takes some of the food.

GUS:
Ssshhh. (enters Jackal Mode)

SHAWN walks alongside GUS and they watch as RED takes out a small red plastic case.

SHAWN:
Now what is that?

GUS:
This is it. I bet you that's a bomb and he's gonna put it on one of the bikes.

RED leaves the room with the case.

SHAWN:
Hmm.

They sneak over to the door and peer through the window. They see RED setting up an IV and DUTCH unbuttoning his shirt.

DUTCH:
Come on, Red. Let's get this over with.

GUS:
What the heck?

SHAWN sees the names on the IV bag and the bottle.

SHAWN:
Dude, why would someone take gemcetabine or capecitabine?

GUS:
Wow, you were nowhere close on the pronunciation.

SHAWN:
What are they for?

GUS:
Those two together, you probably got pancreatic cancer.

SHAWN:
Prognosis?

GUS:
Not good. It's pretty terminal.

SHAWN:
He's dying?

SHAWN and GUS walk back through the main area.

GUS:
So Red is not the bad guy. He wouldn't smuggle in drugs to help Dutch and then turn around and kill him.

SHAWN:
This case is bizarre. Why kill someone if he's already dying?

GUS:
That begs the question who knows he's dying?

EXT. STADIUM, DAY

SHAWN:
We don't come up with something soon, he's a goner. We need to know who stands to gain from Dutch's death. And for that we need his will.

GUS:
But Lewis said there was no will.

SHAWN:
(peers into the trailer window) He doesn't know his dad's dying, Gus. If you were dying of cancer, wouldn't you have a will? (listens at the door)

GUS:
Are you kidding? I've had my estate planner on speed dial ever since we started this stupid business. Do you know how many times I've had a gun shoved in my face because of you?

SHAWN:
Three? (opens the door)

GUS:
Wrong answer.

They go inside and GUS shuts the door after them.

INT. DUTCH'S TRAILER, DAY

SHAWN is kneeling on the floor looking through a file box while GUS looks in the bedroom.

GUS:
We're never gonna find it.

SHAWN:
(looks at floor tile) Wait a minute. There's something weird with this tile.

GUS:
Looks fine to me.

SHAWN:
(opens Swiss Army knife) No, no, no. The pattern's off, just a little bit. Like someone pried one up and put it down wrong.

SHAWN pries up the tile to reveal an envelope.

SHAWN:
Bingo. (grabs the envelope)

GUS:
Is that his will?

SHAWN:
(opens envelope) It's just as good. A life insurance policy.

GUS:
That doesn't make any sense.

SHAWN:
Tell me about it. Dude, seriously, Tell me about it. I have no idea what this means. (gives GUS the policy)

GUS:
You never could understand legalese.

SHAWN:
Oh, really? Remind me who it was that set up our Psych 401(k)?

GUS:
Oh, you mean our 601(k)s? Because India doesn't have 401(k)s.

SHAWN:
It's a growth economy, Gus. We've already made, like, 500 rupees.

GUS:
That's $13.

SHAWN:
Man, just tell me what I need to know.

GUS:
Shh! Do I rush you when you're doing your whole, "Ooh, I'm sensing this, I'm sensing that?"

SHAWN:
Always, and you usually jab me in the ribs with your elbow. Which is like a chocolate harpoon.

GUS:
Are you finished?

SHAWN:
Maybe.

GUS:
On first read it says if Dutch dies of natural causes, there's barely a payout.

SHAWN:
That doesn't make any sense for someone who's always putting himself at risk.

GUS:
But Dutch has a unique indemnity policy. If he dies during one of his stunts, his beneficiaries receive $1.2 million.

SHAWN:
Who are the beneficiaries?

GUS:
His wife and his son.

SHAWN:
Gus. I know who our killer is. (knocks head against cabinet before getting up)

INT. STADIUM, BACKSTAGE, NIGHT

ANNOUNCER:
And it is a packed house here for tonight's main event!

SHAWN waves down DUTCH on his motorcycle, preparing the enter the stadium proper.

ANNOUNCER:
The legendary Dutch "The Clutch" Jenkins in his most dangerous stunt ever. We are moments away from show time, ladies and gentlemen!

DUTCH stops and removes his helmet.

DUTCH:
What the hell are you doing here? I thought I fired your ass.

SHAWN:
(walks to side of bike) I just came to apologize to you, Dutch.

DUTCH:
For what?

SHAWN:
I was wrong about you. All this time, I thought you were the kid who shot milk out of his eye. You know? Willing to do just about anything for attention regardless of how it affects the people around you. But that's...that's not the case, is it?

DUTCH:
Son, I'm getting tired of the sound of your gums flapping.

SHAWN:
You're all about family. Aren't you, Dutch? You love 'em more than life. That's why you've been trying to kill yourself. I sensed a dark cloud over you. You're terminally ill. I'm sorry, man. It must be so scary knowing that you're gonna die, especially when you're all that your family has. And that's why you took out that special insurance policy, the one that only you know about. Now all you gotta do is make sure that you die in the middle of a stunt and your family gets a windfall. Right? It should've been a simple matter of you sabotaging your own stunts. But, Dutch, you're a victim of your own talent. You actually are a little unkillable. Even with all your faulty mechanics, your instincts kicked in and prevented you from failing.

ANNOUNCER:
(muffled) It's almost show time, folks. Dutch "The Clutch" Jenkins is here to perform a gravity defying spectacle.

SHAWN:
Look, I know this is your last stunt for a while, and that's my fault. If this disease gets you before your next show, your family gets nothing. So, I'm sure whatever your method is tonight, it's foolproof.

DUTCH:
What are you gonna do now?

SHAWN:
Nothing. I'm not gonna try and stop you. And I will not say anything if you go through with it. (holds his hand up) You have my word.

DUTCH looks at him slowly before taking his hand in a firm grip. They let go and DUTCH puts on his helmet.

SHAWN:
Just let me leave you with this, Dutch. It doesn't take a psychic to see how much people love you. Your son came to me, and hired a psychic against his better judgment to keep you alive. And you don't know this yet, but all he wants in the world is to be more like you. You go to your son or your wife or anyone on your crew for that matter, and you ask them which they'd rather have. Six more months with you or a million dollars. You know damn well what they'll answer and they won't have to think about it for a second.

DUTCH:
(lifts visor and looks at SHAWN) Is that right?

SHAWN:
(nods) True story.

DUTCH:
You're wrong. (reaches down and does something to the bike) I was that kid in class who shot milk out of his eyes. And I was damn good.

DUTCH closes his visor and starts up the engine. He then taps his helmet twice before speeding through the open doors into the stadium proper. SHAWN can only rub the back of his head as he watches him go.

ANNOUNCER:
And here he is now! Dutch "The Clutch" Jenkins!

The crowd chants his name as DUTCH takes position. SHAWN walks away. He stops as he hears the ANNOUNCER.

ANNOUNCER:
And he's off. Speeding down the ramp. He's past the point of no return. It's all or nothing.

SHAWN turns around and stares at the space outside the open doors, waiting.

ANNOUNCER:
He did it! He did it! A perfect landing! Give it up as Dutch is doing a victory lap around the arena. What a night! You've witnessed history here tonight, folks! Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it...

SHAWN smiles in relief and walks away.

EXT. STREET, NIGHT

JULIET is walking back to the car with coffee but pauses when she sees LASSITER talking and laughing with a WOMAN in the car.

LASSITER:
No, really? You grew up your whole life in Santa Barbara?

WOMAN:
Yeah. I didn't like it much...

JULIET reaches the car.

LASSITER:
Oh, no. Who did, right? I just cannot believe that! That's amazing. That's fascinating.

JULIET walks over to LASSITER.

JULIET:
(through window) What are you doing?

LASSITER:
Oh, I'm just talking to your friend Blair here. She's great. We have so much in common.

JULIET:
She's not my friend.

LASSITER:
What do you mean? You didn't send her down here to meet me?

JULIET:
No! I don't invite friends to dangerous stakeouts. But I know her. She's a professional.

LASSITER:
(turns to BLAIR) Please tell me you're a hit man.

JULIET:
Oh, Carlton!

BLAIR:
So are we gonna do this or not?

LASSITER and JULIET show her their badges.

BLAIR:
I gotta go. (gets out and walks away)

LASSITER:
So, I guess we're not on for Saturday, huh? (facepalms)

Episode 3x04 The Greatest Adventure in the History of Basic Cable

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

We are looking at SHAWN, HENRY and GUS sitting at a table in an interrogation room from the angle of a surveillance camera. It says "Monday, 8:15pm". HENRY leans back in his chair, GUS rubs his face with his hand and SHAWN drums with his hands on the table. The angle switches to their level and into color.

HENRY:
Don't say a word.

SHAWN:
(after a long pause) Fergulous.

HENRY:
Shawn, I said no words.

SHAWN:
Oh, I see how works. Two weeks ago, playing Scrabble, it's not a word. Now, suddenly, it is a word because it's convenient for you. Oh, buddy.

SHAWN reaches behind GUS' ear and GUS slaps him away.

SHAWN:
Dude, you've got some peat moss jammed behind your ear.

GUS reaches behind his ear himself.

SHAWN:
It could be infested with mites.

GUS:
Mites? (puts his leg on the table) I lost a $200 shoe. Your dad almost got a skull fracture. You're the one who got us into this, and absolutely nothing happened to you.

HENRY:
Would you two stop it? I've been on the other side of this table a thousand times. You'll tell them only what they need to know.

SHAWN:
What do we say about Uncle Jack?

HENRY:
He's not here, is he, Shawn? Why don't we take care of ourselves? We didn't do anything wrong. We didn't break any laws.

SHAWN looks a little cagey and won't meet HENRY'S eye.

HENRY:
Oh no. Oh no. What... What did you do, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Nothing. It's just the laws keep changing. It's getting very challenging to keep up with them all. Did you know, for instance, that is it now illegal pretend to give a perm to a possum? What?

HENRY:
Shawn. Did you or did you not break any laws?

GUS:
We impersonated priests.

HENRY:
What?

SHAWN:
What? We were professors.

GUS:
We were priests, Shawn.

The door opens and VICK, LASSITER and JULIET enter.

VICK:
You gentlemen have a lot of explaining to do.

LASSITER:
You can bet your ass I'm getting to the bottom of this.

SHAWN:
Don't I get a phone call or something?

LASSITER:
No.

SHAWN:
Fine. How about a text message? I'll be quick. I just need to respond, "OMG, LOL." Here's a question. How do you make the face that's winking with the tongue coming out one side?

HENRY elbows SHAWN in the side.

VICK:
Mr. Spencer! Now, by my estimation, you may be in some serious trouble here, so I am only going to ask you this once. (leans down) Where's the gold?

SHAWN looks to HENRY.

HENRY:
It's not quite as simple as that.

SHAWN:
Right, if we were to really answer that question, we'd have to go back quite a while.

VICK:
How long?

SHAWN:
About 20 years.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. CLASSROOM, DAY

About twenty years ago, in an elementary school classroom, a man is standing in front of the students, telling a story of some glamourous adventure. The children are enthralled. The MAN'S nametag reads "Shawn's Dad" though he is obviously not HENRY.

MAN:
As the rain thundered down from the dark night sky and 30-foot waves crashed over his ship, the great pirate Bouchard stood on his bow, pointed at the California coast, and yelled, "We shall take this land as ours, men!"

The kids all cheer and applaud.

BOY:
Your dad's awesome.

SHAWN:
I know.

BOY:
I'm so glad my dad didn't come. I mean, I don't even know what a manager of debt consolidation does, anyways. Except drink.

MAN:
Rumor has it that Bouchard was obsessed with searching for Spanish gold. They also say he may have had syphilis and went crazy searching for something that never existed. But I say the gold did exist! (dumps fake coins out of his pack)

While the MAN has been talking, a police car pulls up and HENRY steps out. SHAWN sees him and tries to hurry things up.

SHAWN:
Okay, my dad has to go now. Thanks, Dad. See you later. Bye.

HENRY walks in at that moment and the two men look at each other.

HENRY:
Wh... Wh... What the heck's going on here?

The TEACHER walks over.

TEACHER:
Officer, we're just in the middle of a class. Is there a problemm with something?

HENRY:
Yes, there is a problem. That's not Shawn's dad, 'cause I'm Shawn Spencer's father.

TEACHER:
You're not Shawn's dad?

MAN:
Uh, well, uh, you know technically...

HENRY:
Uh, technically, that is my brother Jack, who technically didn't tell me he was coming to town and obviously cooked up this ruse with Shawn to fool his new teacher. What were you thinking?

SHAWN:
I don't know. I just thought it'd be cooler if Uncle Jack spoke.

HENRY:
Look, class, I'm sorry to break this to you, but... He's not a real treasure hunter. And this is not real gold.

The class groans in disappointment.

JACK:
Kids, my big brother Henry is absolutely right. This is not real gold. But it is real chocolate! (throws the coins into the air)

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

LASSITER:
What does this have to do with the gold?

SHAWN:
Relax, Lassidophilus, we're getting there. Last night...

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, NIGHT

HENRY, SHAWN and GUS are walking along the road towards HENRY'S house. We learn it is Sunday night at 10:20.

HENRY:
What can I say? The movie didn't make any sense.

SHAWN:
Of course, it didn't make any sense to you. You came in 20 minutes late, fell asleep for an hour, then woke up and asked me what happened. You always do this.

They enter the yard through the open gate.

HENRY:
What can I say? They're making the movie theaters too damn dark. It makes me sleepy.

SHAWN:
So basically I paid $10 for you to take a nap.

GUS:
Uh, basically, I paid...

SHAWN stops them when he sees movement inside the house.

SHAWN:
Dad, someone's in the house.

GUS:
Oh, my God. Let's call the cops. We should call the cops.

HENRY goes over to a birdhouse and pulls out a gun.

SHAWN:
You keep a stun gun in the birdhouse? What's under the garden gnome, an M-80?

HENRY points the first two fingers of his left hand towards his eyes and then points to the roof of the house.

SHAWN:
You want me to poke you in the eyes on the roof?

HENRY then points at SHAWN and motions for him to move. He then goes around the side of the house.

GUS:
We're calling the cops, right?

SHAWN sighs and goes around the opposite side from his father.

GUS:
Why aren't we calling the cops? (puts up hands like he's about to fight)

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, NIGHT

SHAWN enters carrying an oar. HENRY comes down the stairs with the stun gun. SHAWN stops when he sees a penny on the coffee table. He picks it up and smiles.

SHAWN:
Dad, wait.

HENRY:
Stop!

HENRY turns on the living room light and we see Uncle JACK kneeling by a table where he quickly closes a drawer.

SHAWN:
Uncle Jack! I knew it was you as soon as I saw the penny.

SHAWN hurries over and hugs JACK.

JACK:
(laughs) The kid! Shawn, my boy. Hey. And by the way, that's a '59 penny. It's the first year they used the Lincoln Memorial on it. I want you to keep it. (pats SHAWN'S shoulder)

HENRY puts the stun gun down and doesn't look too pleased at seeing his younger brother.

SHAWN:
Thanks, man.

GUS runs into the room with an attempted battle cry. He is carrying the garden hose aiming the spray nozzle. He stops when he sees JACK.

GUS:
Jack?

SHAWN:
Dude. A hose, really? What were you gonna do, give him a high colonic?

GUS:
Shut up, Shawn. (starts to leave)

JACK:
No, no, no, no. I get it. You bust in here, you blind him with water, and then you make your move, baby! Come here, you! (hugs GUS)  Ah, boys. (puts an arm around each of their shoulders) It seems like only yesterday I was bringing you kids to the track, and we were betting the ponies.

GUS:
I was the only 8-year-old kid who knew what a trifecta meant.

SHAWN:
Uncle Jack, I haven't heard from you since you sent that e-mail from Prince Albert's boat in the Maldives.

JACK:
Yeah, well, I had to sign a confidentiality agreement there, guys. Can't really talk about it. Ooh! By the way, I got presents for everybody. (opens backpack) I got these when I was excavating near Machu Picchu. Dug them up myself.

JACK pulls out what looks like tribal masks and hands them to SHAWN and GUS. They look at the masks before switching them. They then hold them up to their faces and make growling noises. JACK walks over to HENRY with a small bowl in his hand.

HENRY:
It's been three years, Jack. What are you doing here besides breaking into my house?

JACK:
Breaking in. You gave me a key, Henry.

HENRY:
I didn't give you a key. I don't give anyone keys, not even Shawn. (flips bowl over and sees remnants of a tag underneath)

SHAWN:
(lowers mask) Oh, that's not true. I actually made a copy a while back. It was when I was hooked on Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! on Noggin. I didn't have cable. Oh, I also stole your toilet paper for about a year, and a huge box of sporks. (puts mask to face again)

JACK looks at a framed photo on the mantel before turning to face them.

JACK:
I guess you are wondering why I came back. I want you to help me find Bouchard's treasure.

SHAWN and GUS lower their masks to look at him.

HENRY:
Come on, not that again, Jack. I hate to break it to you, little brother, but Bouchard's treasure does not, has not, and will not ever exist. It's a pipe dream.

SHAWN:
Don't listen to him, Uncle Jack. He's a dream killer.

JACK:
Ah, I understand his frustration. All those years spent listening to me drone on about the whole "treasure" thing without even a semblance of proof. I get it. One thing confuses me, though. If it is just a figment of my imagination, where'd I get this? (holds up treasure map)

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION, NIGHT

Monday night, 9:45. LASSITER and JULIET are watching SHAWN from the observation room and he seems to be staring right at them through the one-way glass.

JULIET:
Why do I feel like he can see us?

LASSITER:
No, it's impossible. He can't see or hear a thing.

LASSITER leans forward and so does SHAWN. He then moves his finger and SHAWN turns his head to follow it. VICK doesn't know what to make of it either.

LASSITER:
That's just weird. (he looks off-screen then back to VICK) So, what, we're just gonna let this guy listens in on everything?

There's a MAN sitting in the corner at a desk watching a monitor showing the interrogation room.

VICK:
It's out of our hands, Detective. Now just get in there and get to the bottom of this.

LASSITER:
You got it.

LASSITER and JULIET leave the room.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

iLASSITER and JULIET enter and SHAWN turns to face them.

SHAWN:
When are we gonna find out the deal with suit guy in there?

LASSITER and JULIET exchange a glance.

LASSITER:
Let's just get back to the story.

Everybody sits back down at the table.

JULIET:
I can't believe your Uncle Jack actually had a treasure map.

LASSITER:
I can't believe you actually pretended your uncle was your dad.

SHAWN:
I wanted Gus' dad to do it, but there was a genealogy issue I just couldn't resolve.

JULIET:
What else can you tell us about the Bouchard guy?

GUS:
We could only remember bits and pieces of the Bouchard myth, but Jack filled us in on the rest.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, NIGHT

Sunday 11:15 PM - JACK has the map spread out on the kitchen table. SHAWN and GUS look through all the papers JACK has on Bouchard.

JACK:
November, 1818. Bouchard sailed up and down the California coast, searching desperately for the mythical Spanish gold. He ravaged and looted the mission in Monterey, was repelled at San Juan Capistrano, and finally made land here, at Santa Barbara, where he did battle with a small Spanish garrison and the Chumash Indians.

HENRY takes some glasses from a cabinet.

GUS:
Yeah, I remember reading about that. They say he made off with millions in Spanish gold coins, but his boat sunk off the coast north of here. He disappeared, and years later he showed up in Argentina.

JACK:
Superior retention of historic detail, Gus. Bouchard was also fond of hiding clues to the treasure's whereabouts in the map. And I stumbled upon this one while researching him in Argentina.

HENRY:
(pouring drinks) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! First you say you're in Machu Picchu in Peru, and all of a sudden, now you're in Argentina, so which one is it?

SHAWN:
Dad, he's not a suspect.

HENRY:
(scoffs) He's suspect, all right.

JACK:
Forget him. Forget him, okay? My big brother's always been just a little cynical. And that's what I love about him.

HENRY walks over and hands JACK a whiskey.

HENRY:
You still haven't answered my question. (walks away)

JACK:
What about it, boys? Want to be treasure hunters? (sips his drink)

SHAWN:
Are you kidding me? That's like asking me if I want my own jet pack. Or if I've ever wanted to be a koala bear.

GUS:
Okay, I think he means, yes, you can count him in. And me too.

JACK:
Superb. Mm. (puts drink down and leans against counter) You know, I've been, uh, reading a lot about that detective stuff you do, and it seems to me that having a psychic might be a real asset. Who knew I had one in my own family?

SHAWN:
Well, Uncle Jack, I... I don't know. I'm not really... I wouldn't necessarily say psychic.

JACK:
Stop that right now. Don't you do that to yourself, young man. Do not sell yourself short. Do not feel embarrassed just 'cause you're a little different. Didn't I always tell you you'd be great, didn't I?

SHAWN:
Yeah, you did.

JACK:
Okay, now, here's the plan. Everything we find, we split 50/50...

GUS:
That's after we donate most of it to a museum, right?

JACK:
We are so gonna do that, Gus.

GUS:
Right.

JACK:
You and I are really, up here, in synch. Okay, so the first thing we need to do is...

GUS:
Get matching fedoras?

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

LASSITER has his face half-buried in his palm.

GUS:
Get matching fedoras? You're the one who wanted the fedoras, not me. Stop changing the story.

SHAWN:
My mistake. He wanted the yellow gauchos. I said no to that.

HENRY:
Would you please put me in a separate room from these idiots? I will tell you everything.

JULIET:
Just continue.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION, DAY

Monday morning, 10:15 -

SHAWN: (v.o.)
Jack had told us to meet him at the front steps of the mission, because that was the first step on the map. Gus and I could barely contain our excitement.

GUS trips on the stairs but stands back up quickly.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
I contained mine a little better.

JACK is waiting for them at the door. He sets a penny down on the steps.

JACK:
Okay, just follow my lead. Say yes to everything.

JACK goes inside and SHAWN and GUS follow.

INT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION, HALL, DAY

JACK, SHAWN and GUS are greeted by a WOMAN and MAN.

WOMAN:
Oh, welcome. Welcome. I'm Karen Raven, head of the Santa Barbara historical society. We are delighted to have such a distinguished professor as yourself visiting us.

There are three men paying their respects and lighting candles at the shrine behind them.

JACK:
(Spanish accent) Ah, gracias, gracias. I am Abner Espinoza, and these are my compatriots, Ernesto Agapito Garces con y a de Abelar and Juan Priestly.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

SHAWN:
Oh, now I see where you got the priest thing.

JULIET:
What does that mean?

BOTH:
Nothing.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION, HALL, DAY

RAVEN:
Well, welcome. Please, come this way. (leads them to a door marked private) Now, as you know, most of our prized collection pieces are kept away from the public, but, well, we're happy to open our doors for visiting dignitaries such as yourselves.

BOTH:
(horrible nasal accent) Yes.

RAVEN:
Okay, then. Um... Take as much time as you need. (unlocks and opens the door) And, uh, Bill here will be waiting just outside.

INT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION, ROOM, DAY

Once inside the room, they resume their real voices.

JACK:
All right, boys, we got about 10 minutes before the real Espinoza shows up.

SHAWN:
There's a real Espinoza?

JACK:
Well, technically speaking, we used to be partners. He's a great guy, but we had a little falling out when I had a small dalliance with his wife. And his sister. And his housekeeper, Debbie.

SHAWN:
Uncle Jack, what's really going on here?

JACK:
My research has told me there are clues about the treasure's whereabouts hidden somewhere in this room. (looks around) And it all has to do with the number 152.

GUS:
Why don't we just use the map?

JACK:
Well, technically, there's, uh, something I haven't told you about the whole map.

JACK walks over to a desk and unfurls the map. Part of it is missing.

SHAWN:
Uncle Jack, this is a pretty big thing to leave out.

JACK:
Yeah, I know, I know, I know. It's a long story. (scratches chin) A one-legged woman, a bottle of Cutty Sark... The point is that the missing part of the map is the first step of the hunt. Now, come on, kid, use that psychic gift you got. Come on. (pats SHAWN on the back)

SHAWN studies the map and singles out the capital letters.

SHAWN:
Oh, boy. I- I'm seeing letters, swarming. They're... They're zinging. They're... They're...They're forming... They're forming words. They're forming words... Couleur. C-couleur.

They all keep repeating the word.

SHAWN:
What is that? What does that mean?

JACK:
French... Color... Paint! Painting! That's it. Come on, let's go. Hurry up, more.

GUS:
There are paintings over there.

GUS walks to where paintings are leaning against the wall and starts to flip through them. SHAWN stands with his back to them but angles his head just enough so he can see without being obvious. One painting looks similar to one of the sketches JACK had.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, wait. Go back. Go back.

SHAWN reaches back "blindly" before pulling out the painting.

SHAWN:
Hello, Bouchard. Let me see the map.

SHAWN takes the painting to the desk and sets it down next to the map.

SHAWN:
Where did you hide that clue, you old syphilitic sea dog?

SHAWN sees part of a tower on the ripped section of the map. In the painting, Bouchard's telescope is pointing to the top of a similar tower on the coast.

SHAWN:
I know where the map starts. And I know where the first clue is.

EXT. PARK, DAY

Monday, 11:25AM - SHAWN, GUS and JACK run up to the remains of a tower or column. There is a brass plaque on the base. "Monta√±a de Oro Lighthouse Built in 1816" Underneath that "California State Landmark #152".

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

LASSITER:
Wait. The map was actually real?

GUS:
Oh, yeah. We couldn't believe it.

JULIET:
The lighthouse was the first clue. What happened from there?

SHAWN:
We didn't make it to the second clue.

LASSITER:
Why not?

HENRY makes a motion like he wants them to keep quiet.

GUS:
Because we weren't the only ones who found the lighthouse.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

EXT. PARK, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and JACK run away from the lighthouse and three men emerge from the other side and start shotting at them while chasing them.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

INT. SBPD, OBSERVATION, NIGHT

Tuesday, 2:30AM. The MAN is the suit is still watching the interrogation while talking on his cell phone in Spanish.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

LASSITER, JULIET and VICK re-enter the room.

LASSITER:
All right, Spencer, tell the Chief what you just told us.

SHAWN:
Okay, Chief, here it goes. We're so hungry. I can't get the burrito place on Coda Street out of my mind. They're open late. Gus, children's burrito, no sauce, Dad, I know you're a fan of the carne asada.

VICK:
All right, Mr. Spencer, let me be frank.

SHAWN:
As long as I can be Dean and Gus can be Sammy.

GUS:
Why do I have to be Sammy?

SHAWN:
Fine. He's Sammy. (points to HENRY) That makes you Joey Bishop. Is that what you really want? You want to be Joey Bishop?

JULIET:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, Jules. How often does someone set you up with "let me be Frank"?

JULIET:
(leans over and slaps the table) Shawn!

SHAWN, GUS and HENRY lean back in their chairs. Even LASSITER looks at her, surprised.

JULIET:
Don't forget that you are in a lot of trouble here. And I am probably the only person in this room who cares to see you get out of it. Now, it's 2:30 in the morning, we've been here for hours, enough with the jokes, stop delaying, and tell us what we want to hear! (stands)

SHAWN:
(turns slowly to look at GUS) Oh my God. That was so hot.

LASSITER:
Spencer, tell the Chief what you told us about the guys who chased you away from the lighthouse with the guns.

GUS:
Not just chasing us. They found us hiding in a cabin.

LASSITER:
Who were they?

HENRY:
Jack's partners. Because the one thing that you could count on with my brother Jackie, he always had partners.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. CABIN, DAY

Monday, 2:00PM - The men have tied SHAWN, GUS and JACK to chairs, back-to-back in a circle.

MAN:
Jack! What the hell are you doing?

JACK:
Mark, calm down, will ya? It's all part of the plan.

SHAWN:
Wait a second. You guys know each other?

MARK:
Oh, yeah. We were partners.

GUS:
I thought we were partners.

JACK:
Oh, technically, you're all my partners.

SHAWN:
Well, I don't know where you guys went to partner college, but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to shoot at your partners.

MARK:
Yeah? Should partners do this? (punches JACK)

GUS:
(to SHAWN) Maybe we shouldn't use the word "partners" anymore. It seems to make him mad.

JACK:
(groans) Mark. (spits) Kitten, listen, this is my nephew Shawn, okay? He's psychic. For real. Works with the cops sometimes. Fully legitimate, fully. I only brought him around to help with the hunt. And I was just gonna pay him a small finder's fee. That's it.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) What's finder's fee? Is that like 50%?

GUS:
Not even close.

MARK:
No. Not buying it. You were gonna sell us out. (gets ready to punch JACK)

SHAWN:
Whoa! Psychic things are happening to me! Oh! Running down my legs.

SHAWN peeks with one eye and the other two men with MARK. He remembers seeing them at the mission at the shrine lighting candles. It was the shrine of St. Gerard Majella, Patron Saint of Pregnant Women.

SHAWN:
You don't worry about the pregnancy. Your girlfriend's gonna be just fine.

The man looks over at MARK who looks at SHAWN and JACK.

JACK:
Hmm, hmm, hmm? What did I tell you? Now, why don't you just let us go? We'll all find the treasure. We'll be stinking, filthy rich, and live fabulous lives.

MARK:
No. Give us the map.

JACK:
We don't have the map.

MARK:
Really? That's too bad. (grabs JACK by the collar and prepares to punch him)

SHAWN:
Okay, it's in the backpack.

GUS turns to SHAWN, questioning.

MARK:
Thanks. (lets go of JACK and goes to the backpack)

GUS:
What are you...

SHAWN:
Wait.

GUS:
What...

SHAWN:
Just wait.

MARK tips out the backpack. JACK looks at SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Wait. (to MARK) It's in... It's in the side pouch. (to GUS) Ssh!

MARK pulls the map out of the side pocket then comes back.

SHAWN:
(in stage whisper) Hey, Gus, should we tell Mark that there's a tear in the map?

They watch as MARK opens the map.

MARK:
Son of a bitch, Jack!

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

LASSITER:
Hold it. So, you just gave them the map and told them everything?

SHAWN, GUS and HENRY are eating take-out meals.

SHAWN:
No, not everything.

GUS jabs him in the side with his elbow while sipping his drink.

SHAWN:
Okay, everything.

LASSITER:
So, they found the treasure?

SHAWN:
(scoffs) Not exactly.

SHAWN:
The spirit world is just one of life's little mysteries, like why the Oxygen Network airs Goodfellas, or why fools fall in love.

SHAWN tries to steal a chip from GUS, but GUS slaps his hand away.

VICK:
(enters with a boot and sets it on the table) Oh, here you go, Mr. Guster. This is all they had in lost-and-found in your size.

GUS:
An UGG boot? I can't wear an UGG boot with... (VICK glares at him) It'll be dope with my one Puma. (takes the boot)

VICK:
Now, Mr. Spencer.

BOTH:
Yes.

VICK:
Oh, I meant the older...

HENRY looks at her.

VICK:
Sorry, not old, less...

SHAWN:
Handsome? Less hair? Less friends on Facebook?

HENRY:
Less nose.

SHAWN:
Ooh.

VICK:
Henry. Did you fill out a burglary report on your house yesterday?

HENRY:
I did. But nothing was taken.

VICK:
Oh. And yet why do I feel this somehow plays into this whole mess, doesn't it? (tosses file onto table)

HENRY:
I was the one who picked them up. (takes a bit of his food)

LASSITER:
Wait, wait, wait, wait. How did your dad know where to find you if that Mark guy took all your cell phones?

SHAWN:
That is a good question.

The three of them are still tied up.

SHAWN:
I have to pee.

GUS:
No. No way, Shawn.

SHAWN:
What am I supposed to do?

GUS:
Hold it like a man.

SHAWN:
I'll get a urinary tract infection.

GUS:
Like a man.

JACK:
You know what? You can link your legs underneath your chairs and form a wheel and roll to the bathroom.

GUS:
I don't even want to project how that's gonna happen. I'm not rolling anywhere. I don't know why I listened to either one of you. No one is gonna find us. We're probably gonna die out here.

SHAWN:
Gus?

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
What is that on your leg?

GUS:
Nothing. (moves leg)

SHAWN:
Dude, you are strapped with another cell phone?

JACK:
I can't believe you actually pretended your uncle was your dad.

GUS:
No, no, we're not calling anyone. That is my work phone. For work.

SHAWN:
This is work!

GUS:
My boss is watching everything I do, Shawn. Plus, you already used up half my minutes waiting on hold for concert tickets.

SHAWN:
That was Tony, Toni, Tone and Wet Wet Wet playing together!  You know I can't resist that. The symmetry alone...

JACK:
All right, Gus, this is our only choice, man.

GUS:
Fine. Shawn, reach down and get it.

SHAWN:
Me? I'm not gonna reach down and... You get it.

GUS:
With what hand?

SHAWN:
Fine. I'll do it. Hold still.

SHAWN maneuvers in his chair to try to lower himself. Because of the proximity of their chairs, GUS' chair moves too. He grunts.

SHAWN:
Stop it. You're wobbling!

GUS:
Hold on, now.

They both topple to the floor. SHAWN uses his mouth to get the phone out of its case. GUS jerks his leg.

SHAWN:
Stop flexing.

GUS:
Ow!

SHAWN pulls the phone out by the antenna and drops it on the floor. He then uses a pen in his mouth to dial.

SHAWN:
Wha...No, wait, it's ringing.

MAN: (over phone)
Fu's palace. Want to place order?

GUS:
You must have dialed the wrong number. Hi. We're stuck out in a cabin on Tunnel Road. Can you send help?

MAN: (over phone)
For pickup or delivery?

JACK:
This is Jack Spencer, and I'm willing to offer you a 50/50 split on pirate treasure.

GUS:
Hang up, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Hold on. While he's on the line, you guys want anything?

GUS:
Will you dial it again? And this time try to dial the right number.

SHAWN:
Look, man, I'm dialing with a 10-year-old Erasermate in my mouth. It's not an exact science.

SHAWN dials again and it rings.

HENRY: (answering machine)
You've reached Henry Spencer. Leave your name and number, but speak slowly, because people talk too fast on these things, and I can never understand it. (the message beeps)

SHAWN:
Hey, Dad, what's going on? Uh, I got good news. Great news! The electric wrench you've been wanting is in stock at Home Depot. Uh, what else? There was something else. Oh, I know. If you're not too busy, Gus, Jack, and I are tied up in a cabin about...

With some people, I can communicate through psychic wavelengths. My father is one of them. Val Kilmer is another.

JULIET:
Here's something I don't understand. Jack's partner wanted the map, right? So why would they trash your dad's house? They'd know Jack wouldn't let the map out of his sight.

GUS:
Mark and his men, they weren't looking for a map.

JULIET:
So, what were they looking for?

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN is putting stuff away in a cabinet, HENRY is just standing there, JACK is sitting on a chair while GUS crosses the room.

JACK:
You know you're my boy, Shawn. Why'd you have to go and give Mark the map?

SHAWN:
Because I don't need it. Uncle Jack, trust me. I can re-create the map psychically in my head.

JACK:
Hey, hey! Spare me, kid, okay? You can't snow the snowman. We were so close.

Everyone appears dejected. SHAWN then remembers what JACK was doing when they first saw him.

SHAWN:
(leans on the coffee table) Oh! I feel jittery! (stands) It starts with beans. Gus likes it in the morning. (falls back to the table) Now he has gas!

GUS:
Something having to do with coffee?

SHAWN:
Yes! (hits the table every time he says "coffee") Coffee! Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee table! Coffee table. (pulls out one of the drawers) Mark and his goons weren't looking for the map, were they? (reaches into the space) No, no. They were looking for something else. A different piece of the puzzle. (pulls out a key) Something you didn't want connected to the map at all. (gasps and stands)

JACK:
Oh! That is downright scary! Maybe you really do have a gift, kid. My bad for doubting it. (takes key) Now, this key is also from Bouchard's stuff I found in Argentina. It was useless without that map. But if Shawn can actually re-create that map, that plus this key means we are back on track!

JACK and SHAWN both whoop. HENRY is not impressed.

JACK:
Guys, I got to hit the head. But when I come back, we are finding us a treasure!

SHAWN slaps JACK on the back as he leaves. JACK in turn slaps Henry on the shoulder as he passes.

SHAWN:
(exhales) Hope he bought that.

GUS:
With Jack, you never know.

SHAWN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But if that key is real...

HENRY:
Shawn, come on. Take a look around. Haven't you had enough? These guys... They've destroyed my living room.

SHAWN:
Mark and his goons aren't gonna stop. We got to get back out there! Dad!

HENRY:
No! No. Shawn, no!

SHAWN:
Just come with us. Come with us.

HENRY:
Why do you need me?

SHAWN:
It's not that we need you. We want you. Plus, we need you.

GUS:
We need your truck because my car is still at the lighthouse, and Mark has the key.

HENRY:
There you go. Thank you very much. Sorry. Count me out.

SHAWN:
Shocker!

HENRY nearly bumps into JACK on his way out.

JACK:
(claps hands) Okay, guys, ready? Good. All we got to do now is borrow a car. Now, technically, the term is hot-wiring. However...

HENRY rushes back in.

HENRY:
I'm in. But I drive, I'm the one who decides if and when we go to the police. (points at them emphatically) I don't want any more surprises. Do you understand?

SHAWN:
Yes, Dad!

JACK:
Big bro, I knew you'd come around. Okay, psychic, what's the next step?

SHAWN recalls the map and sees a building that seems to have the key drawn next to it. He puts the key to his forehead. He pulls it away with a deep, shaky breath before putting it back to his head. He does this a couple more times until HENRY yells at him.

HENRY:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
The key will guide us now.

SHAWN holds the key out in front of him and runs from the room. GUS follows.

JACK:
(taps HENRY on the chest) I love this. 50/50 split between me and you guys! (runs after SHAWN and GUS)

EXT, HENRY'S HOUSE, DAY

They all cram into the cab of his truck.

HENRY:
No more surprises, right, Jack?

JACK:
Of course.

They drive away. Hiding down the road is a black sedan. The two men inside are wearing dark suits and sunglasses. The passenger talks into a radio in Spanish. They follow the truck.

EXT. STREET, DAY

Monday, 5:00PM - There is a plaque on the building bearing a sketch and the words "El Presidio del Pacifico - A fort built by the Spanish in 1782 - Destroyed by a fire in 1898". SHAWN holds the key up to the bell tower. It lines up perfectly.

GUS:
Tell me this, Shawn. How are we supposed to find clues from a bell tower that hasn't been around for over 100 years?

JACK:
The Presidio was huge. It would've taken up several blocks. So, what should we do now?

SHAWN sees a local street map showing sights and landmarks for tourists.

SHAWN:
There's only one thing we can do. Go back in time.

SHAWN closes his eyes and overlays the sketch and the street map, getting a location where the bell tower would have stood. With arms stretched out to his sides, SHAWN goes down the sidewalk. GUS, JACK and HENRY follow. A la Indiana Jones, a red line on the map shows their progress.

SHAWN:
The bell tower is calling me!

He stops quickly and GUS bumps into him.

GUS:
Shawn!

HENRY:
Come on. (slaps SHAWN on the arm)

SHAWN continues to lead them through the neighborhood. HENRY is lagging behind.

HENRY:
Shawn, wait up! Shawn!

HENRY turns to look behind him and walks into a door when he turns around again. GUS helps him keep up. SHAWN stops in front of a muffler shop.

SHAWN:
This is it. This is where the bell tower stood.

JACK:
What do we do now?

SHAWN:
Let's buy some mufflers. (goes inside)

GUS:
He doesn't even own a car. I bet you I end up paying for this.

EXT. MUFFLER SHOP ROOF, DAY

SHAWN sighs and HENRY walks up to him, a Band-Aid on his head.

SHAWN:
You all right?

HENRY:
Yeah. Yeah, I'll survive. What are we doing up here, Shawn?

SHAWN:
I'm not sure yet. But that's part of the fun, isn't it? (pats HENRY on the stomach)

JACK and GUS join them.

JACK:
We are good to go. The manager said we can take as much time as we need. Alvin. Good guy. Filipino. He loved me.

GUS:
And Jack offered him 50% of the treasure.

JACK:
I also gave him an '82 penny. It was the first year they used zinc instead of copper.

GUS:
Okay, what is the deal with you and all these pennies?

JULIET: (v.o.)
Yeah, I don't get that either.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

The meals are gone and a street map is spread on the table. HENRY is standing but leaning on his chair from behind. GUS is lying on his side on the table, fiddling with a pen.

JULIET:
So, Jack collects them and then leaves them places? What's that about?

HENRY:
Jack was always interested in history. Collecting pennies was his way of being a part of it.

SHAWN:
But leaving the pennies was his own personal philosophy. See, Uncle Jack always said...

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

EXT. MUFFLER SHOP ROOF, DAY

JACK has an arm about GUS' shoulder.

JACK:
I leave the penny because it's good luck. And Lord knows, the world could use more good luck.

GUS:
Are you for real?

HENRY:
All right, Shawn, what are we doing up here? You think that when Bouchard captured the fort, he stood up here on the bell tower, gazing out into the big blue ocean, looking for a place to hide the treasure?

SHAWN:
If I were a French pirate with a bad temper and at least one venereal disease, where would I be looking?

SHAWN looks out at the coastline and pictures it against the map.

SHAWN:
(points) That's it. That's it, right there. We're so close! Let's go!

EXT. STREET, DAY

They exit onto the street and are spotted by MARK and his goons.

MARK:
Hey!

GUS:
How did he find us?

JACK:
He's got the map. He must've figured it out. Come on, let's go!

They run. JACK and his men get into their car. On the map, the red line progresses into the hills away from the city.

EXT. FOREST, DAY

They run through the woods, JACK and HENRY in the lead, followed by SHAWN and then GUS. GUS slips in mud and cries out. His foot gets stuck but the others don't notice and keep running.

GUS:
Shawn! Shawn!

SHAWN runs back to GUS.

GUS:
I can't leave my Puma, Shawn!

SHAWN pulls GUS by the arm, pulling him free but leaving the shoe behind. MARK and his men are still chasing them. JACK bumps into a tree, knocking his bag to the ground. SHAWN and GUS catch up.

SHAWN:
(grabs bag) I got it.

They stop at the edge of the bluff.

SHAWN:
This is it. This is the bluff on the map.

A black helicopter rises up to face them. SHAWN, GUS and HENRY raise their hands. JACK takes off.

SHAWN:
(looks back) Uncle Jack!

The men in the helicopter are the same ones who followed them earlier.

SHAWN:
I know this probably isn't the right time to say this, but, dude, I think we're gonna get to ride in a helicopter!

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

Tuesday Morning, Right Now - VICK is arguing with the MAN who had witnessed the interrogation.

MAN:
You're obligated to let me speak with them.

VICK:
I'm not obligated to make you do anything.

MAN:
(holds up paper) Chief, perhaps you should see this one more time.

VICK:
No, I don't need to see the letter one more time.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET are looking through the open door at VICK'S conversation.

SHAWN:
Jules. Lassie, what's going on out there? What's the deal with that guy? He didn't say a word to us when he brought us in.

JULIET:
His name is Andres Candelaria. He works for the Spanish government.

LASSITER:
Apparently, he's part of some inter-governmental task force on stolen antiquities.

VICK clears her throat as she and CANDELARIA enter. JULIET and LASSITER stand and move out of the way.

CANDELARIA:
Hello, Mr. Spencer. I believe you know why you're here.

SHAWN:
And I believe you know I know why I'm here. Now, why am I here?

CANDELARIA:
To help us find the treasure that rightly belongs to my government.

GUS:
But we didn't find anything.

CANDELARIA:
Si. And my men have been searching the bluffs all night, as well, with no luck.

SHAWN envisions the letters from the map once more.

SHAWN:
That's because you stopped us one step short. Your treasure's not in the bluffs, che. (stands and exclaims) The spirits are guiding my man paw! (starts writing on the two-way mirror) It's like... It's like that movie Idle Hands, except with no nudity, which means I must be completely unwatchable right now. Do either of these words mean anything to anyone? It could be the clue we're looking for.

SHAWN has written "Coleur" and "Cueva".

CANDELARIA:
"Cueva" is Spanish for cave.

JULIET:
"Couleur" could be French. I think it means paint. I spent a semester in Paris. Got salmonella poisoning and lost 20 pounds. Best diet ever!

GUS:
(moves to stand next to SHAWN) Painted caves. That's it! Bouchard was French, but he was fascinated with the Chumash Indians.

HENRY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa! The Chumash Indians? Well, they used to paint caves all over the area. We used to roust punks in there from drinking all the time.

SHAWN:
"Roust punks"? Thank you, Jack Lord. We will now lead you to the treasure. (tosses pen onto table) I know the cave.

CANDELARIA:
Very well. Let's go.

VICK:
(steps in) Stop. You are not doing this.

CANDELARIA:
The only reason I brought these men here in the first place was because Spencer would not talk with us unless he was in the station.

VICK:
Okay, look, I said we would cooperate with you, but they are employees of the SBPD, and they're not going anywhere without my detectives.

CANDELARIA:
Chief, we have been through this, no? (pulls out letter) This is from your Treasury Department, giving me full power to call the shots. Now, I thank you for your help, but it will no longer be needed. Vamos.

CANDELARIA heads out with his men. VICK, JULIET, LASSITER and HENRY are not pleased with the situation. GUS leaves and SHAWN follows, bumping into JULIET as he does so.

SHAWN:
Sorry.

INT. PAINTED CAVE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are digging a hole. CANDELARIA and his two men watch.

GUS:
I can't believe we're actually digging for buried treasure.

SHAWN:
I know, dude. And you're getting your pants totally dirty, and you don't even care. I'm so proud of you.

CANDELARIA:
Keep digging!

GUS' shovel hits metal. They stop and look at each other. They put down the shovels and SHAWN grabs one of the lanterns. They crouch down and wipe away the dirt to reveal initials.

SHAWN:
H. B.

GUS:
That could be for Hippolyte de Bouchard.

SHAWN:
Or Harry Belafonte.

GUS:
No.

SHAWN:
No, that does... That doesn't make any sense.

CANDELARIA:
Just get it out!

SHAWN and GUS pull the chest out of the hole and rest it on the ledge. They open it to reveal a smaller coffer. They lift off the lid to reveal a canvas bag.

GUS:
Oh, my God. It's real.

CANDELARIA:
Si.

SHAWN grabs a fistful of coins and lets them fall through his fingers back into the bag.

CANDELARIA:
Well done. Buen trabajo. You should know the Spanish government owes you a great debt of gratitude. Now, could I please have the coins?

CANDELARIA motions for one of his men to fetch the bag.

SHAWN:
(hands GUS the bag) Before we do that, I should tell you, I know three things that you probably don't know. Uno, the secret of NIMH and the secret of my success? Same secret. Dos, I know that you don't work for the Spanish government. And tres, these caves are actually quite slippery.

SHAWN throws a shovel at CANDELARIA, causing him to fall into the man behind him. He then pushes the other man into the hole.

GUS:
What are you doing?!

SHAWN:
Bag! Bag! Bag! Bag! Bag!

GUS tosses SHAWN the bag and they run from the cave. They stop in the tunnel and shove the bag of gold into their own then continue running. In the cave, CANDELARIA gets up, yelling at his men. They then chase after SHAWN and GUS.

EXT. FOREST, DAY

SHAWN and GUS run through the woods.

GUS:
What is going on? Why are we running? Why did we leave the caves?

They pause running but spot MARK and his men.

MARK:
Hey!

They continue running as CANDELARIA and his men join the chase. GUS runs alone and stops, calling for SHAWN. SHAWN joins him, coming out from behind some trees.

SHAWN:
What happened to your other Puma?

GUS looks down at his shoeless foot.

GUS:
You got to be kidding me! I lost another shoe?

SHAWN:
Let's go!

They continue running.

MARK:
This way!

CANDELARIA:
Vamos!

EXT. WOODS, ROAD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stop when they come to a road. A car skids to a stop.

BOTH:
Jack!

They run up to the car.

SHAWN:
Yes!

JACK:
Hey, guys! I told you I'd come back. I've been tracking you the whole time. Do you, uh... Do you have the treasure?

SHAWN:
This is it.

JACK:
(exclaims) I always believed in you, kid! I always knew you were special!

They hear CANDELARIA shouting and try to get into the car.

JACK:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't come in here. We gotta split up for safety. Now, listen, they're not gonna hurt you if you don't have the gold. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

GUS:
What?

JACK:
Come on, let's have it.

After a slight hesitation, SHAWN tosses the bag to JACK who catches it and places it in the passenger seat.

JACK:
Remember the place on Foothill where I used to take you when you were a kid, get you burgers and shakes?

SHAWN:
Yeah, it's Red Robin. It's still there.

JACK:
That's the one. I'll meet you there in an hour. I'll be there. (drives away) Yee-haw!

MARK arrives with his men and aims a gun at them. SHAWN and GUS raise their hands.

MARK:
Damn it! You gave him the gold, didn't you?

CANDELARIA runs up with his men.

CANDELARIA:
Hey, that's my gold!

Both parties turn their guns on each other.

MARK:
Who the hell are you?

SHAWN:
If there were doves flying around, we'd be in a John Woo movie.

MARK:
Son of a bitch!

CANDELARIA:
I'm going to kill Jack!

MARK:
Oh, you know Jack?

CANDELARIA:
He was my partner.

MARK:
He was my partner.

SHAWN:
Uh, technically, Iron Giant guy, he was all of our partners. And the guy who answers the phone at Fu's Palace.

GUS:
And the guy at the muffler shop.

SHAWN:
Good catch, Gus. Look, fellas, we're just gonna roll on out if that's cool. Let you settle your business here. (starts backing away)

Guns are aimed at them once more.

MARK:
Not so fast. Why don't we just take the nephew here and ransom his ass for the gold?

CANDELARIA:
We have no other choice.

SHAWN:
No, no, no, no. No. You... You always have a choice. You could ransom Gus's ass. You could swirl it up. You could ransom half my ass and half his ass.

At that moment, the police arrive. JULIET, HENRY and LASSITER are in the lead car followed by black-and-whites. LASSITER gets out of the car and aims his gun at the men.

LASSITER:
Drop it!

JULIET:
(also has gun drawn) Hands in the air!

MARK, CANDELARIA and their men lower their weapons. SHAWN mouths to HENRY that he's okay and HENRY nods. Later, the men are being led away in handcuffs and HENRY is standing with SHAWN and GUS.

GUS:
Shawn, you know I don't curse very often. So, when I do, you know I mean it. What the hell just happened?

SHAWN:
I thought you weren't a big fan of the wrap-up.

GUS just glares at him.

SHAWN:
All right, I'll give it to you. So, back at the station, I realize Andres' accent isn't Spanish, it's Argentinean. And that's where Uncle Jack just got back from, so I figure he's one of Jack's partners.

GUS:
How did you know that?

HENRY:
You worked at that winery in Argentina for a year. I kept the postcards.

SHAWN:
You did?

HENRY:
I use 'em as beer coasters.

SHAWN is surprised by this revelation.

GUS:
Okay, Shawn, but...

SHAWN:
So that's why I called Andres "che", to see if he'd react. Which he did. because in Argentina, "che" is slang for "buddy" or "pal". Sort of like I call you "black star" or "home skillet" or "big baby Burton."

GUS:
Don't ever call me "home skillet."

SHAWN:
Right.

GUS:
But why didn't you tell anybody?

SHAWN:
I did. She knew just what to do with it. (looks over at JULIET)

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, DAY

We see that when SHAWN bumped into JULIET, he slipped her a note: "Andres is not real. Follow us. You smell nice."

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

EXT. WOODS, ROAD, DAY

HENRY:
Doesn't matter what happened. The important thing is you guys are safe, and nobody got hurt. Now, let's get out of here. I -I'm too old to be staying up all night. (walks away)

SHAWN and GUS start following.

GUS:
I can't believe I lost my other shoe.

SHAWN:
Dude, I will buy you another pair. Just tell me you didn't really drop 200 bones on sneakers.

GUS:
No, Shawn. I was making a point.

SHAWN:
How much were they really?

GUS:
80 bucks. And I have $32 left on my Foot Locker gift card.

SHAWN:
So, what am I looking at, like 30 bucks?

GUS:
48.

SHAWN:
I'm in for half. We'll get some jerk chicken on the way home.

GUS:
Fine.

INT. RED ROBIN, DAY

SHAWN is sitting alone at a table. He has a meal in front of him.  HENRY shows up.

HENRY:
Hey.

SHAWN:
Hey.

HENRY:
(sits) Strawberry, huh?

SHAWN:
(slides glass across) Oh, you got to taste it.

HENRY:
(takes a sip) I'd still go vanilla, but it's good.

SHAWN:
Are you kidding me? That is the best shake on the planet. One part ice cream, two parts awesome.

HENRY:
It's been a long time since you called me for a ride.

SHAWN:
Yeah, well, Gus got tired of waiting for someone who wasn't gonna show.

HENRY:
All right, look, Shawn, here's the thing about your Uncle Jack. He'll always come back. You're not the first to get duped. You certainly won't be the last. Welcome to the club, kid.

SHAWN:
I guess I probably owe you an apology. I can see now where Uncle Jack might not have been the best role model.

HENRY:
Yeah, maybe not.

SHAWN:
Why didn't you say anything when I was a kid?

HENRY:
Because I always wanted you to have the... The "fun uncle" in your life. I was only hard on you because I didn't want your life to turn out like the "fun uncle".

SHAWN:
Well, it didn't. Not totally.

WAITRESS:
Here you go. (takes away basket and leaves change)

SHAWN:
Thanks.

HENRY:
(picks up a penny) You know the penny thing? Your grandpa taught me that, and then I taught it to Jack when we were kids. He just took it to another whole level.

SHAWN:
(chuckles) Yeah, he, uh, he seems to do that a lot.

HENRY:
I still can't believe that he got away with the gold. You got to think that someday all this stuff is gonna catch up with him, huh?

SHAWN:
Yeah. And that day might just be today. (drops gold coins onto the table)

HENRY:
(taken aback and whispers) Does Gus know about this?

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah. He's got the rest of it. Don't worry, we're donating it to the museum.

HENRY:
All of it?

SHAWN:
Ish.

HENRY stammers, unable to get out a coherent sentence.

SHAWN:
I saw Jack following us. I knew he was gonna show up in the car. I made the switch when we were running through the forest.

HENRY:
So, what does Jack have?

SHAWN smiles.

EXT. ROAD, DAY

JACK has pulled over to the side of the road. He chuckles as he opens the bag. However, instead of the coins, he dumps out rocks. He pushes the rocks around in the hopes of finding gold. The only shiny thing he finds is a penny.

JACK:
Well done, Shawnie. (chuckles) Well done. Well done.

Episode 3x05 Disco Didn't Die, It Was Murdered

INT. APARTMENT, NIGHT

1978. A MAN is building a bomb using an alarm clock. He places it carefully into a zippered bag.

EXT. APARTMENT, NIGHT

Sgt. HENRY Spencer listens at the door before motioning to his fellow officers.

HENRY:
Okay, come on. Move it out.

One of the officers uses a small ram to smash the door open.

INT. APARTMENT, NIGHT

The MAN gets to his feet and finishes putting the bomb in the bag just as HENRY enters, gun drawn.

HENRY:
Listen, Franks...

FRANKS hugs the bomb to his chest. HENRY sees the bottles of chemicals on the table.

HENRY:
You have the right not to get shot. Make the wrong move, you lose that right. Put down the bomb.

FRANKS puts down the bomb and raises his hands.

HENRY:
Good move.

EXT. SBPD, DAY

A press conference is being held by the CHIEF. HENRY is standing near the podium.

CHIEF:
We recently obtained intelligence of a bomb plot by an anti-government radical. His intended target was this very building. We owe the success of this investigation and, indeed, our very lives to Sergeant Henry Spencer.

There is applause and choruses of "Well done" and "Good job".

CHIEF:
Sergeant Spencer, would you like to say a few words?

HENRY:
No, thanks, Chief. A police officer doesn't deserve any special attention for just doin' his job.

PRESENT DAY

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter with a WOMAN who is carrying a notepad.

SHAWN:
You may be able to sense the electricity in the room. That's because our arrival usually signals that a huge case is going down.

VICK is standing in the doorway to her office.

VICK:
Step in here please, gentlemen.

SHAWN:
That's the Chief. She likes the two of us very much.

LASSITER and JULIET are already in the office. VICK sees the WOMAN.

VICK:
I'm sorry, you are?

SHAWN:
Oh, sorry, Chief. I got roped into doing a silly interview
with The Independent. They've been calling and begging for weeks, and I finally relented.

WOMAN:
But... you called me.

SHAWN:
And you called me back, which means we're both right. The important thing is that you got your cover story.

WOMAN:
Actually, this is page 64.

SHAWN:
It really depends on how you fold it, doesn't it?

VICK:
She can't be in here, so get her the hell out.

GUS and VICK go into the office while SHAWN walks the WOMAN around to a different wall.

SHAWN:
Come to think of it, I think you'll probably get a better shot here through this window. Now, try to catch me with a good expression, preferably with this eyebrow raised... like so. Or my serious face. Best-case scenario, snap a shot when my signature look comes up. I call it Se√±or Gotcha!

WOMAN:
How will I know what that is?

SHAWN:
You'll know. Good luck. We're all counting on you. (leaves)

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN enters with a sigh.

SHAWN:
Lassie, you're here! I need you...here. (moves LASSITER aside and pulls up the blind so the WOMAN can see) Thank you. (goes over to VICK) Chief, what's up?

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, as you may be aware, a Cal...

SHAWN strikes a pose, putting his foot up on a chair.

VICK:
California prisoner's advocacy... Are you okay?

SHAWN:
Right as rain. (turns and poses for the camera)

VICK:
Long story short, a handful of convictions, some of them decades old, have been recently called into question.

JULIET:
Unfortunately, the biggest one was a Santa Barbara P.D. conviction. (hands VICK the file)

VICK:
So we're reopening the case and launching a new investigation. Now we're hiring y...

SHAWN hits some modeling poses.

VICK:
You to provide us with any psychic leads that you may have. Now, normally, we don't devote department resources to this, but these are... special circumstances. (hands SHAWN the file)

SHAWN:
Could you do the handoff again, Chief?
SHAWN forces VICK to take it again and then he turns to face the WOMAN who snaps a picture.

SHAWN:
Thanks. (opens and reads the file) Oh, no.

GUS:
What is it?

SHAWN:
It's my dad's biggest case.

SHAWN makes an "ugh" face and the WOMAN snaps a photo and gives a thumbs up. SHAWN shakes his head.

EXT. SBPD, DAY

VICK walks down the stairs with SHAWN and GUS.

VICK:
It goes without saying, Mr. Spencer, that your father is in no way to participate in this investigation. He's no longer on the force, and his meddling could compromise the case in court. Do I make myself clear?

SHAWN:
Yes, you do, Chief. What isn't clear is why people always say, "it goes without saying," yet still feel compelled to say the thing supposed to go without saying. Doesn't that bother you?

VICK:
No. And frankly, I could care less.

GUS:
Now, that's the one that bothers me. Why do people say, "I could care less" when they mean "I couldn't care less"?

VICK:
Why don't you tell me how to properly say this: if you share any official information about this case with your father or let him anywhere near any new evidence, then the two of you will have to find another police department to work for. And I will personally see to it that each of you is charged with obstruction of justice.

GUS:
You split an infinitive.

SHAWN:
Good catch, Gus.

VICK:
You two realize I carry a gun, right?

GUS:
That was perfectly elocuted.

After a look from VICK, they leave.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk in the front door.

SHAWN:
My dad's gonna freak when he sees this. We have to go into stealth mode. No taking his calls. This won't hit the news till tomorrow. That should give us a 24-hour head start.

HENRY is at the fridge in the main office.

HENRY:
Hand it over.

SHAWN:
Dad, how did you get in here?

HENRY:
The unlatched window? The unlocked back door? Maybe this key that I made? You choose one.

SHAWN:
What do you want?

HENRY:
I dropped by to share my new chocolate chip raisin bread recipe with you, Shawn. What do you think? I know Chief Vick just gave you the new Franks case. Why don't you let me take a look at what you're hiding in that folder so I can get moving on this?

SHAWN holds the folder behind him.

SHAWN:
Okay, you're right. Chief Vick did just hire us. But there is no way...

GUS:
Nope.

SHAWN:
...that I'm showing you what's in this folder.

HENRY:
You're lucky I'm asking you. I could do this the simple way. I could grab it, clean up any evidence of struggle before you and your friend knew what hit you.

SHAWN:
In some states, that's child abuse.

GUS:
I think all of them.

SHAWN:
Look, Chief Vick made it clear that you, specifically, were to come nowhere near this case.

HENRY:
This shouldn't even be a case. The son of a bitch was let out on some microcrap problem with my search warrant.

GUS:
Everybody makes mistakes.

HENRY:
(angrily) There was no mistake! (points at GUS)

SHAWN:
Whoa.

SHAWN at GUS sit at their respective desks.

HENRY:
It was the 70's. We did what we had to do. But only when we knew we had the right guy, and I got the right guy. Period.

SHAWN:
Okay. You got the right guy. Still doesn't mean I'm gonna put you on this case. Nor would I even want to. Dad, you have no idea how Gus and I roll... Gus, tell him.

HENRY:
You know what? You go ahead and handle this half-assed like you do everything else. But you bear this in mind. (to GUS) This case is important to a lot of people who could have died if he had blown up our headquarters. (to SHAWN) It should be important to their family members too. (leaves)

SHAWN:
Whoa. (puts file in drawer) Never seen my dad beg before.

GUS:
That's how he begs?

SHAWN:
He's clearly not gonna let this go. So, look, if we're gonna investigate this thing undisturbed, we're gonna have to jump a few steps, fill in the blanks when we're done. We should go straight to the D.A.'s office.

INT. DA'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS sit down on either side of a man reading a newspaper.

HENRY:
Beat you by eight minutes. (lowers paper) Not too embarrassing.

SHAWN and GUS stand quickly.

SHAWN:
Dad, I knew you would come and try to investigate this on your own. Do you have any idea how dangerous this is?

HENRY:
Why? I'm a tax-paying, voting citizen. Therefore, I have a right to speak to any elected official, such as the D.A., I please.

SHAWN:
You don't have to be a tax-paying, voting citizen, do you?

RECEPTIONIST:
May I help you?

The three of them hurry over to the booth.

SHAWN:
Yes. My name is Shawn Spencer. I am the head psychic for the Santa Barbara Police Department. And that is my partner...

HENRY:
Yeah, yeah, that's his partner, Methuselah Honeysuckle, which makes me Old Scratch Johnson. We need to see copies of the original court transcripts for the Eugene Franks case.

RECEPTIONIST:
I'm not sure I can release those.

SHAWN sees a photo of the man with his wife and baby, a selection of paint slips and a boxed Louisville Slugger.

SHAWN:
I'm getting a very soft, cuddly vibe here. It seems like you and your wife are...

HENRY:
They're gonna have another kid. It's a boy. Congratulations. Do yourselves a favor. Don't call it Shawn. Problems. More importantly, according to the Freedom of Information Act, those transcripts are available for viewing. So...

RECEPTIONIST:
Very well. Good point. I'll have our records department make copies.

SHAWN:
Thank you very much.

The RECEPTIONIST takes off his headset and leaves.

SHAWN:
You know, you're putting a damper on the proceedings.

HENRY:
You call it a damper. I call it working...

SHAWN pulls HENRY away from the booth.

SHAWN:
All right, that's it. Come here. All right, I need you to hear me, okay? If you insist on staying involved in this case, there are going to be rules. I was hired by the police department, therefore, it is my ass on the line, and those rules will be made by me. You are no longer a cop. And unless you plan on going back to the Academy climbing the wall, doing the obstacle course where you shoot the bad guys, but not the lady with the sack or the guy with the cane or the squirrel with the tail and the big, fat nut... That started off well.

GUS:
It really fell apart at the end. You should have had a name for the wall or something.

SHAWN:
What I'm saying is that you need to listen to me, is what I'm saying.

HENRY:
All right, Shawn. Point taken. You got a deal. (walks past SHAWN to the door)

SHAWN:
(calls after HENRY) That means you're workin' for me now. Why don't you grab some coffee for us? Black.

HENRY'S already out the door.

GUS:
Two sugars.

SHAWN:
(calls) Two sugars!

INT. PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN and HENRY are sitting at his desk looking over the documents of the Franks case.

SHAWN:
I don't understand... You guys had to handwrite everything? What if you need multiple copies?

GUS sits on the corner of his own desk.

HENRY:
Well, we had one computer, but it took up the entire second floor. Generally, we would use the mimeo machine. (looks at the document in SHAWN'S hand)

SHAWN:
How long did that take, a week?

HENRY:
All the high-tech fancy gadgets they use today don't solve crimes any better than we did. A good detective is born with all the tools he needs right here. (points to his forehead)

The office phone rings and SHAWN looks at the caller ID before answering.

SHAWN:
Hello. Chief, what's the good w... My dad, down at the D.A.'s office? (looks at HENRY who waves his hands in the negative) No, I-I don't think so. I think I can clear this up for ya, Chief. That wasn't my dad. That was Phil Collins. We saw Phil down at the courthouse. My dad gets mistaken for him all the time.

HENRY:
(whispers) I don't look... Shawn, I don't look anything like Phil Collins.

SHAWN and GUS both shush him.

SHAWN:
No, I'm... I'm fairly certain about this, Chief. He was humming "Invisible Touch", if that helps you. No, I- I wasn't aware that Phil Collins lives in Switzerland. (covers the phone and talks to GUS) How does she know so much about Phil Collins?

GUS:
I don't know.

SHAWN:
Yes. I do hear you. I will make sure he stays away. (ends call) Love you too. (slams phone into stand) Do you see? Do you see? We have to be more careful...

HENRY:
Okay, hot shot! All right, I get it. Tell me what you can glean from this. (puts paper on the desk in front of him)

SHAWN:
You'd like to know what I can glean?

HENRY:
Glean.

SHAWN looks at the paper and sees only "Exhibit A" listed.

SHAWN:
The D.A. arrested after only submitting the initial evidence?

HENRY:
Correct-a-mundo. The evidence I uncovered in that department was so strong, the D.A. didn't need anything else to get a conviction.

GUS:
But all the evidence is poisonous fruit because of the search warrant.

HENRY:
This evidence, yes. Good thing I got a different warrant for the second round and the D.A. didn't submit any of that stuff which means we can use that now. All the high-tech gadgets in the world won't tell you that, will it?

SHAWN:
(gets a drink from the fridge) We gotta get the Chief to let us into the county archives so we can take a look at that evidence. Gus, gimme your keys.

GUS:
That would be a no. Ogletree's checking my mileage.

HENRY:
We'll take my truck. (stands)

SHAWN:
No, we won't. That raises the chances of you being seen again. We'll have to take my motorcycle. I've always wanted to try threesies. Who wants the handlebars? Gus? Feels like you.

GUS:
No.

HENRY:
Yeah, that shouldn't draw any attention. We'll cab it.

SHAWN:
Fine. It's funny. It's usually me who can't show my face in public.

INT. EVIDENCE LOCKUP, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and HENRY are looking at some boxes on a table.

GUS:
Just think, the contents inside these boxes could determine whether someone spends the rest of their life in jail.

SHAWN:
Catch.

SHAWN throws a hammer at GUS who catches it.

SHAWN:
Better hope they don't reopen the Handyman Killer case. Your fingerprints are all over the murder weapon.

GUS:
(drops the hammer) That's not funny, Shawn!

SHAWN:
Dude, I'm kidding. It's not really evidence. It was just lying here. (flips through a notebook)

GUS:
Well, stop it. You know I'm afraid that being wrongfully convicted is the tragic way my story ends.

HENRY:
(brings over a box) Would you two girls stop bitching and see what we got here?

SHAWN:
What is this stuff?

HENRY:
Various possessions, personal effects of Eugene's we found after he was arrested. (opens box) All right, what do we got here? Pawn ticket made out to Eugene a few days before he was arrested.

SHAWN:
(reads ticket) "Goldstein's Pawn". Anybody?

GUS:
Wait. That place is still around.

HENRY:
Desperate people pawn things. Let's see what Eugene pawned and never got back, huh?

SHAWN pulls the ticket out of HENRY'S hands.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

VICK is standing in front of JULIET and LASSITER.

VICK:
Two new cases just came in. One involves an international diamond smuggling ring.

LASSITER:
Sweet!

JULIET:
Bingo!

VICK:
The other involves fraudulent permits at a plastics factory.

JULIET and LASSITER groan and make faces.

VICK:
Well, I'll leave it up to the two of you to decide who gets which. (hands them each a file and leaves)

LASSITER:
(turns to JULIET) I am the head detective.

JULIET:
(faces LASSITER) Who owes me. I covered your butt on last month's paperwork.

LASSITER:
Damn it. (looks around and sees BUZZ) Follow my lead. McNab! Get over here!

BUZZ walks over.

LASSITER:
I don't know, O'Hara. I don't think he's ready.

JULIET:
Yeah, I... I don't think he is either.

BUZZ:
No. I'm ready.

LASSITER:
All right. McNab, how would you like to do some real police work?

BUZZ:
I'd love to.

LASSITER:
Now, technically, you'll be working under Detective O'Hara and myself, but we'll let you take the lead on this. (gives BUZZ a file)

JULIET:
It will be such a good experience for you. It might even earn you a spot on the detective bureau someday.

BUZZ stands a little straighter and looks over at LASSITER who shrugs.

BUZZ:
Wow! Thanks, guys. This means a lot. The fact that you think so highly of me to trust me...

LASSITER:
Yeah, yeah, we love you. Get back to work.

BUZZ smiles and walks away. LASSITER and JULIET look knowingly at each other.

INT. PAWN SHOP, DAY

HENRY, SHAWN and GUS stand at the counter as GOLDSTEIN reads the ticket.

GOLDSTEIN:
This ticket is from 30 years ago when my dad ran the shop. I'll have to go look through the box. (walks to shelves)

SHAWN:
The box? What do you think the box is? A giant room like in "Raiders"?

GUS:
I think it's a box.

SHAWN:
Secret catacombs underneath the building like in "National Treasure"?

GUS:
Shame on you for knowing that.

GOLDSTEIN:
(returns with box) This is where we keep all the old unclaimed stuff from over the years.

GUS:
As I said, a box.

SHAWN:
What do you think's inside the box?

GUS:
Will you calm down?

SHAWN:
I can't, man! There's stuff in there! All kinds of stuff, old stuff, shiny stuff, secret stuff... How come you're not as excited as me?

GUS:
Because I'm not a raccoon.

SHAWN:
You look like a raccoon.

GOLDSTEIN:
Hey, you're in luck. This ticket here matches this old receipt. Not a lot of info on it, I'm afraid.

SHAWN takes the receipt and reads a long number.

HENRY:
I know what that...

SHAWN:
Sshh, let me get it.

HENRY:
Right. Your case.

SHAWN:
Oh, I'm getting something here. Oh, this is intense. I can see Eugene. He's desperate, he's sweating nervously, he's stinky! He wants to get rid of something, cover his tracks, hide where he's been. So, he brings in the title to his car! That must be the Vehicle Identification Number right in there.

HENRY:
(whispers) Right. Whose benefit was that for?

SHAWN:
(whispers) Don't ever question my methods in front of a civilian. OK? Never do that.

HENRY:
Come here.

HENRY pushes SHAWN and GUS over to an area of the shop away from the counter.

HENRY:
I always thought that Eugene was gonna use the car in a bomb plot. That was a common M.O. back then. He probably pawned the title to cover his tracks.

GOLDSTEIN:
If nobody reclaimed the title, we would have sold it.

The trio goes into a tight huddle.

GUS:
We could use the VIN number to track where it ended up.

SHAWN:
That could take us all over the city or the state, for that matter, thus increasing the chances that you'll be seen by someone you work with and you being caught by the police.

They all sigh in frustration. SHAWN looks around the shop.

SHAWN:
Unless... (goes to a rack of clothes and pulls out a pair of pants) Nobody recognizes us.

EXT. PAWN SHOP, DAY

HENRY, GUS and SHAWN exit wearing 70s outfits. They walk down the street.

GUS:
I feel ridiculous.

HENRY:
Speak for yourself. I've got this shirt at home. His mother used to love it.

GUS:
Yeah, like 30 years ago.

HENRY:
Kid, I wore it to lunch last week.

EXT. USED CAR LOT, DAY

HENRY spots the car.

HENRY:
There it is.

MAN:
It's been sittin' in some old lady's backyard for dang near 30 years.

HENRY:
You got the keys? Let's take a look inside.

MAN:
Make me an offer and it's yours.

HENRY:
You gotta be kiddin'.

The MAN holds his arms out in an extended shrug.

SHAWN:
Just... give us a second here. (pulls the others away for a sidebar) How much money do we have between us?

HENRY:
What? (pulls out wallet) I think I got about... 50 bucks.

GUS:
I got about $400 between my wallet and my sock. (pulls money from sock) It's my "just in case" money.

SHAWN:
All right. (takes their money) Add in what I have, and we've got about... (pretends to add) $450.

HENRY:
(reaches for money) All right, let me go talk to him.

SHAWN:
Uh, uh, uh. You stand down, Popeye Doyle. I'll handle this. (walks over to MAN) Got about $450 here. Now, how much is this gonna cost me?

MAN:
$450.

SHAWN:
Done.

SHAWN slaps the money into the MAN'S hand. The MAN walks away and SHAWN turns to the others with a laugh.

SHAWN:
He's good!

GUS:
Nice goin', Shawn. That was all of our money.

HENRY:
That's what happens when you send in the one guy who's never bought a car before.

SHAWN:
We had exactly enough.

GUS opens the driver's door while HENRY walks around to the passenger side.

HENRY:
All right, look at it this way, Gus. It isn't a car, it's a time machine. (starts looking in the back seat) This little kitty's gonna tell us about Eugene 30 years ago.

GUS:
Well, looks like a car to me. And if I bought it, I'm drivin' it. That means my same car rules apply. (sits in driver's seat) Wipe your shoes before entering. No slamming doors. (adjusts the seat) No food. (the seat lies back flat)

SHAWN grunts as he tries to open the hood. He gives up and wipes his hands together.

SHAWN:
Looks good up here.

SHAWN then spots a partial faded decal in the corner of the windshield. It looks like a stylized rearing horse.

INT. CAR, DAY

HENRY pulls down the back seat to reveal a welded panel. He sees a join at the top.

HENRY:
Doesn't look like factory soldering. (pulls down the panel to reveal a cubby) Smuggler's hatch. (picks up old roll of film and laughs)

EXT. USED CAR LOT, DAY

HENRY stands and holds up the film.

HENRY:
Gotta get this down to the crime lab.

SHAWN:
Uh, uh, uh.

HENRY:
Let me guess. This is where we take one step back before involving the police.

SHAWN:
We need to see what's on that film first. (holds up his right hand)

HENRY throws the film but GUS catches it instead.

SHAWN:
That's how we roll.

SHAWN attempts to slide across the hood on his butt in a cool 70s move but fails. He pushes himself to the other side and stands, clearing his throat.

SHAWN:
(gets into the car) Gonna need a tetanus shot.

EXT. STREET, DAY

HENRY exits the store with the envelope of developed photos.

HENRY:
Got it. Miracle anything came out.

SHAWN takes the envelope and opens it as HENRY leans against the car. GUS is wiping it down with a cloth. Some of the photos are double-exposed and some have the "burned" effect. Most seem to be of Franks posing with the car.

SHAWN:
Whoa, this guy really loved his car, huh?

GUS:
After seeing it all cleaned up, I like it too. In fact, I love it.

SHAWN finds a picture of Franks with another man and woman in militia gear posing with rifles.

SHAWN:
Bingo! You think these two other ones could have had something to do with the bombing?

HENRY:
From the AK-47s they're holding, they had something to do with something. I think it's worth checkin' out.

SHAWN:
There's no telling where they are, if they're even still around.

HENRY:
You know, back then, I used to have this snitch working for me. His name was Pookie. Real weasel. The guy would turn on his Siamese twin for a buck. If these two had anything to do with this, Pookie's the guy who would have known.

SHAWN and GUS smile at the name.

SHAWN:
(clears throat) Sorry. What... What was his name?

HENRY:
Pookie.

GUS:
(laughs) Do you know where we can find this...

HENRY:
Pookie.

SHAWN and GUS laugh.

HENRY:
Yeah, his name is... His name is Pookie Wiggington, and I know where to find him. What's so funny?

SHAWN:
(still laughing) Stop, please! Nothing's funny, you just... But you're keepin' it real right now.

GUS:
Right on.

HENRY:
Let's see if we can find Pookie.

SHAWN and GUS bend over laughing.

HENRY:
See if he still remembers the'70s.

EXT. DANCE CLUB, NIGHT

The car pulls into the lot then turns and skids perfectly into a parking space. The three step out of the car somewhat unsteadily. SHAWN grips the door.

SHAWN:
(looks sick) If that had been on purpose, that would have been totally cool.

GUS:
I need to get that power steering fixed. Not to mention the seat is jammed all the way to the front and makes my entire left side fall asleep. (walks like 70s cool)

They walk to the entrance of the club.

INT. DANCE CLUB, NIGHT

The club is decorated like the 70s and disco is playing. Everyone is dressed like the 70s as well.

DJ:
And remember, tomorrow night will be Ladies' Night at the Top Flight Dance Club, where it's the'70s every night!

SHAWN:
Don't worry! I think Pookie remembers the'70s just fine. By the way, I'm just puttin' this out there. Once we re-solve this case, preserve your legacy as a detective, you don't have to say thank you. No biggie.

HENRY:
Course it is. Heck, let me say it right now. Thank you, Gus.

GUS:
You're welcome. (takes off sunglasses)

HENRY:
(sees a black man up by the DJ) That's Pookie. Let's go.

HENRY walks away, and, after a shared glance, SHAWN and GUS follow. They meet up with POOKIE behind a beaded curtain.

POOKIE:
Officer Spencer. Long time no see. What brings you gentlemen to my establishment?

SHAWN:
Well, Mr. Pookie...

GUS laughs.

SHAWN:
As you may have heard, the D.A. recently overturned the conviction on the Eugene Franks bombing case.

POOKIE:
Maybe I heard. Maybe I didn't.

SHAWN:
Right. We're lookin' for information on a few people that might have used to run with old Eugene.

POOKIE:
Sorry. I don't know what you're talkin' about.

HENRY:
All right. I know how this works. Hit the other sock. Give him some money.

POOKIE:
No offense, guys, but I don't need your pocket change.

SHAWN:
(puts hands to his head) Mr. Pookie, I can see two of Eugene's partners in crime, a man and a woman. Dangerous, highly skilled with military weapons, but not U.S. military, smuggled weapons.

POOKIE:
I used to trip like that, always looking for the escape.

HENRY:
Pookie, he's cool. He's... Psychic.

POOKIE:
Really? Then I can dig it. Spiritual.

SHAWN:
Yeah.

POOKIE:
(taps forehead) Third eye.

SHAWN:
(points) That's where it is.

POOKIE:
You guys are deep. Like me. Gimme five.

POOKIE and GUS slap hands.

POOKIE:
So, listen, you were dead on it. Check this out. The cats you were describing ran with Eugene, all right. There were two of 'em. Derek Ford, white guy, stringy hair, and his old lady Melanie, really fine. I got shot over a white girl like that once. Anyway, they were together in a militant organization with Eugene called S.A.G., Soldiers Against Government. They were into all kind of radical stuff.

SHAWN:
Why would Eugene go all those years and not rat them out?

POOKIE:
Word on the street was that SAG was ruthless. Nobody dared cross them, not even one of their own.

HENRY walks away from the table, dejected.

SHAWN:
So, Eugene was just a patsy?

POOKIE:
You didn't hear it from me. No, them suckers are dangerous!

SHAWN sighs as he walks over to HENRY who is leaning on another table.

HENRY:
He had partners. My biggest bust, and I was wrong.

SHAWN makes to put a hand on HENRY'S shoulder, but his father waves him off and he rubs his head instead.

EXT. SBPD, DAY

A disheveled LASSITER slams the car door shut and turns to face an equally disheveled JULIET.

LASSITER:
Everything hurts.

JULIET:
(rubs her upper arm) You had to be a tough guy and go in first. Let's just fill out the incident report and be done with this fiasco. Ow.

INT. SBPD, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET trudge into the station. BUZZ spots them.

BUZZ:
(walks with them) What happened to you guys?

LASSITER:
The diamond smuggling case that Detective O'Hara wanted to take didn't go quite as planned.

JULIET:
That I wanted to take? You're the one who insisted on it, Mr. Head Detective.

LASSITER:
(sighs) Basically, we conducted a stake out to catch the smugglers red-handed, but when we opened the cargo container to seize the evidence, we discovered we had the wrong one.

JULIET:
This one belonged to exotic animal smugglers, and it was filled with wild marmosets.

LASSITER:
I hate marmosets.

JULIET:
Apparently, they don't like being shot at.

LASSITER:
No, apparently not.

JULIET:
All I can remember after that are hundreds of those tiny, razor-sharp claws and teeth!

LASSITER:
Lower primate, my ass. I recognize a military formation when I see one.

BUZZ:
You'll be happy to know that case you gave me took a fun turn.

LASSITER:
(sarcastically) That's great!

LASSITER and JULIET walk around either side of BUZZ.

BUZZ:
It turns out that plastics factory was a front for real-life sea pirates. (grins and walks away)

LASSITER and JULIET stop and turn around.

JULIET:
You're kidding.

BUZZ:
No. They've been using high-tech boats and GPS to rob freighters in the shipping lanes. Now, I'm teaming up with the Coast Guard for a showdown off the Santa Barbara coast.

LASSITER:
On the high seas?

BUZZ:
Appears so.

JULIET and LASSITER exchange a look.

LASSITER:
Aw, gosh! I'm sorry, Buzz, but... you need a certain level of clearance to work with the Coast Guard. It's... It's department rules. (slaps BUZZ lightly on the arm)

BUZZ:
Really?

JULIET:
Yeah. Yeah, I'm afraid we're gonna have to take over from here. But good work on getting us to this point.

BUZZ:
Oh. Well, it was fun while it lasted.

JULIET:
Yeah.

LASSITER:
(takes file from BUZZ) Yeah. Good work, buddy.

LASSITER and JULIET walk away from BUZZ.

LASSITER:
(whispers) We're gonna capture pirates!

JULIET:
(whispers) I know!

They slap each other's hand.

JULIET:
Ow!

LASSITER:
Almost makes up for the rabies shots.

JULIET:
Almost.

They walk off in different directions.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, YARD, DAY

HENRY is raking as SHAWN watches. They are back in their regular clothes.

HENRY:
Let's face it, Shawn. I blew the case.

SHAWN:
You're quitting on me?

HENRY:
I'm not quitting. I just realized that maybe Chief Vick is right. I should stay out of it.

SHAWN:
Dad, this was your big case.

HENRY:
(laughs) My big case? My big bust? You see, that's the problem right there. That's how I started seeing it. But, in reality, it's a Santa Barbara P.D. case and always has been. (puts down rack)

SHAWN:
You don't believe that.

HENRY:
A good detective knows when to let it go. That's a lesson both you and I could learn right now. (goes inside)

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY, DAY

SHAWN walks around to where GUS is waiting by the car.

GUS:
Where's your dad?

SHAWN:
He's not coming. He says it's to protect the case, but I can tell it's really bumming him out that he got fooled 30 years ago.

They get in the car.

SHAWN:
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but instead of lording over him that this is our case, our rules, I think we have to convince him that we can't solve this thing without him.

GUS:
How do we do that?

SHAWN:
Most likely, through the use of trickery.

INT. CAR, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are driving through a neighborhood, HENRY is in the backseat.

HENRY:
What kind of wood are we gonna use for these bookshelves, Gus?

GUS:
Uh, cypress?

SHAWN:
Cypress? Really?

GUS:
It's a good wood. It's what Noah's ark was made of.

HENRY:
You wanna use something that breathes a little more. But don't worry, we'll hit a lumberyard on the way there. At least I get a chance to use my new laser level.

GUS pulls into the driveway of a typical suburban house.

HENRY:
Gus, why are we stopping here?

GUS:
No reason. I just randomly selected this spot.

HENRY:
Don't be a smart-ass. You're reading an address of a piece of paper, we're sitting in somebody's driveway. Whose house is this?

An SUV drives slowly up the road as they talk.

SHAWN:
Okay, look, Dad. Actually, we're dropping in on some people that we know.

They hear screeching tires and look to see the SUV pulling away.

GUS:
Shawn, I think that's them!

HENRY:
What the hell is going on?

SHAWN:
Don't lose 'em! Go! Go, go, go! Come on!

GUS reverses and turns out of the driveway, losing a hubcap as he does. They chase the other car through the neighborhood until GUS blocks the road with the car.

GUS:
So, what do we do now?

SHAWN:
I don't know. I've never cornered anyone before.

EXT. STREET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS get out of the car. GUS has the laser level in his hand.

SHAWN:
Whoo! You better hope they're not uneven in there.

They approach the other car.

GUS:
I'm gonna blind 'em with the laser, Shawn.

SHAWN leans forward to tap on the passenger window the backs away quickly. GUS raises the laser. The window rolls down and we see an older couple - 50s or 60s.

WOMAN:
May we help you?

SHAWN:
(approaches car) Derek and Melanie Ford? Or should I say, "Soldiers Against Government"?

INT. FORD HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

MELANIE is chopping vegetables. DEREK gets SHAWN and GUS something to drink.

DEREK:
You sure your father doesn't want to come inside?

Through a window we see HENRY leaning against the car in the driveway.

SHAWN:
Oh, no, no, no. He's clinically insane and a biter.

DEREK:
Sorry again about running from you guys. But when we saw the Mercury Cougar in the driveway, we just figured it was Eugene coming after us for revenge.

GUS:
Revenge for what?

DEREK:
He thinks that we set him up to take the rap for the police headquarters bombing.

MELANIE:
We know he's been asking around town about us, trying to figure out our whereabouts. We thought he'd finally found us.

SHAWN:
Well, don't you worry about that. You help us with this investigation, we will make sure the police protect you from your old pal.

DEREK:
Thank you.

MELANIE:
Tell him everything, honey.

DEREK:
After Eugene got arrested 30 years ago, we freaked out, and we stopped our radical ways.

MELANIE:
We became Soldiers for Government and we built this great life.

DEREK:
You have to believe us. We had nothing to do with setting Eugene up. I mean, we were all brainwashed. We were all caught up in the movement.

GUS:
Do you know of anyone else who would have wanted to set him up?

We hear the knife slice and MELANIE cries out.

MELANIE:
Oh! (pinches her finger and sucks on it)

DEREK:
Honey, are you okay?

MELANIE:
Mmm. Oh, yeah. Oh! I cut myself pretty good. I, uh, excuse me. I'm gonna have to go put something on this. (leaves)

SHAWN sees some mail on the counter and one envelope has the same logo as the decal on Eugene's car.

DEREK:
I'm sorry.

SHAWN:
We should get going.

DEREK:
Oh, no!

SHAWN:
No. no, no. Thank you for your cooperation. (shakes DEREK'S hand) And rest assured, Eugene will not learn of your whereabouts. Thanks again.

DEREK:
Yes.

GUS shakes DEREK'S hand on his way out.

SHAWN:
(calls) Hope your finger feels better!

MELANIE:
(calls) Thank you!

SHAWN and GUS leave.

EXT. DRIVEWAY, DAY

SHAWN:
Good news, Pop! The trail is hot again.

HENRY:
Like I said, count me out.

GUS gets in the car.

SHAWN:
Damn it, Dad! Do you have to be so prideful all the time? So, you made a mistake 30 years ago. Nobody cares. Just get over it.

GUS gets out of the car.

HENRY:
Not everybody's as comfortable screwin' up as you are, kid.

SHAWN:
I'm comfortable 'cos my mistakes were the only thing that was ever pointed out to me.

SHAWN starts to get in the car, but HENRY pulls him back. GUS gets into the car again. GUS gets out again.

HENRY:
Here we go, here we go. Would you put away the violin? I pointed out the good stuff, Shawn, but usually, you were too busy bragging and showing off to take notice.

GUS:
Enough! I'm sick of you two fighting all the time! Listen, Mr. Spencer, Shawn needs you on the case because, frankly, you're old, and we were barely even alive during the'70s. And Shawn, your dad needs you on the case because even though you can be annoying, you actually have a brilliant idea every now and then. But you're both too damn stubborn to admit you need each other. Now can we go, please? Thank you. (gets in the car and slams the door)

HENRY:
Is he always such a know-it-all?

SHAWN:
You don't know the half of it. Very preachy.

LATER...

INT. CAR, DAY

HENRY:
So, tell me what you have.

SHAWN:
I think there's another SAG member out there.

GUS:
How do you know that?

SHAWN:
Did you see Melanie when we asked her if there was anyone else who'd want to set up Eugene? She cut herself right there, right there on the spot.

HENRY:
Yeah, no, no. Maybe they were telling you what they wanted you to know, not what you needed to know.

SHAWN:
I think they're protecting somebody from Eugene.

GUS:
But there were only three people in the picture.

SHAWN:
No, there was four. The three of them and whoever took the picture.

HENRY:
Maybe they're protecting an old mentor.

SHAWN:
I'm pretty sure that Eugene met Derek and Melanie when they were all students at Santa Barbara University. Let's see if they shared any professors or advisors or RAs. RA, that's a thing, right?

GUS:
It is.

SHAWN:
Okay, let's do this. Back to undercover.

EXT, SBU, COURTYARD, DAY

They are back in their 70s clothes. SHAWN is on the phone.

SHAWN:
Got it. Thank you, Jules. (closes phone and they walk towards entrance) All right, according to Juliet, University records show that our SAG members only shared one professor, and that is Dr. Richard Colbert.

INT. SBU, HALL, DAY

They enter the hall and spot Colbert's office.

SHAWN:
(knocks) Doctor Colbert?

SHAWN tries the door and it's unlocked. They go inside.

INT. SBU, COLBERT'S OFFICE, DAY

They walk past a bulletin board and some file cabinets. SHAWN tries a drawer but it's locked. They stop, and, in unison, remove their sunglasses. Colbert is dead on the floor. SHAWN spots something up one of his nostrils and sees a cloth on a counter.

SHAWN:
I think Eugene got here before we did.

EXT, SBU, COURTYARD, DAY

BUZZ greets LASSITER and JULIET as they arrive on scene.

BUZZ:
I've been waiting for you guys.

LASSITER:
Yeah, we got your call when we were out on the open ocean chasing down our sea pirates at flank. That's a nautical term for maximum speed.

JULIET:
We cordoned the private vessel before they could club haul, that's the nautical term for evasive maneuver, and make it to international waters.

BUZZ:
That sounds awesome. What do modern-day sea pirates look like?

JULIET:
We have no idea. Apparently, once you get three miles out, it's out of our jurisdiction, so the coast guard has us sequestered to a tiny, windowless cabin on the lubber deck.

LASSITER:
Yeah, apparently that's a nautical term for "place they send you to puke".

JULIET:
Had to wash my hair three times.

LASSITER:
Still sorry about that.

JULIET:
Let's do this.

They enter the building.

INT. SBU, COLBERT'S OFFICE, DAY

Forensics are already there going over the scene.

JULIET:
So, what do we have here?

BUZZ:
The deceased is one Dr. Richard Colbert. Male, 60 years old, professor of chemistry. Apparently, he died from a lab accident involving poisonous hydrochloric acid fumes.

SHAWN and GUS enter as BUZZ is talking.

LASSITER:
When will people ever learn that alcohol and hydrochloric acid don't mix?

GUS:
Technically, they do. See, the hydrogen atoms in the acid form a loose bond with the chlorine...

LASSITER:
What the hell are you wearing?

SHAWN:
Ooooh! I'm gettin' some serious jive, and it is fly.

GUS makes a buzzing sound. Behind BUZZ, we can see HENRY through a window in the hall.

SHAWN:
I can see the struggle. There's a rag on Colbert's face. It was him who masterminded the bombing, 30 years ago. He set Eugene up. And Eugene has murdered him in revenge.

As SHAWN is talking, HENRY looks at the bottles of chemicals and remembers the night of the bust. He waves his hat to get SHAWN'S attention.

SHAWN:
But wait, there's more! Ooh! Yeah, the feel is strong. (walks over to the counter near HENRY) Oooh! I am gettin' it! And it is a bad mother...

GUS:
Shut your mouth!

SHAWN:
I'm havin' a vision.

GUS:
I can dig it.

SHAWN turns to watch HENRY and tries to guess what he's saying with hand motions like a horrible game of charades.

SHAWN:
Ooh! It's a... It's a big birthday cake!

GUS:
Ooh! Make a wish! What?

SHAWN:
Bomb. Eugene's built another bomb! He built it here in the lab! That's how he's gonna exact his revenge on the remaining members of SAG! We've gotta stop him now!

Nobody moves.

SHAWN:
That...That's all I got. The jive's over. We should go before people explode.

Everybody runs out.

EXT. STREET, DAY

A black-and-white patrol car races down the road, siren on, followed by LASSITER'S car and then GUS' car. They stop in front of the Fords' house. Two cars are already there.

EXT. DRIVEWAY, DAY

As the new arrivals get out of their respective cars, two officers bring EUGENE around from the backyard. One is carrying a bag.

OFFICER:
Found him lookin' around out back. Must have hidden this under the house. (hands LASSITER the bag)

LASSITER:
(opens the bag) We got a bomb! (puts bag on the ground) Which... hasn't been activated.

EUGENE sighs.

LASSITER:
(to OFFICER) Call the bomb squad.

The OFFICER walks away, talking into his radio.

LASSITER:
Eugene, looks like you've been up to your old tricks.

EUGENE:
(scoffs) I'm only here because they called me saying they were finally ready to come clean.

The Fords are clinging to each other, watching the proceedings. The OFFICER returns and takes up his position at EUGENE'S side.

LASSITER:
Invited guests don't go snoopin' around the back, do they?

EUGENE:
I was just checking to see if anybody was home. I swear!

LASSITER:
Save it for the trial. You're under arrest for the murder of Richard Colbert.

The officers start to lead EUGENE away.

EUGENE:
Wait, wait! Colbert's dead?

LASSITER:
And the attempted murder of Derek and Melanie Ford.

DEREK:
Thank God, you stopped him in time.

SHAWN sees MELANIE place her hand on DEREK'S shoulder and her finger is perfectly fine, not bandaged like it should have been.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. FORD HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

MELANIE:
I cut myself pretty good. I, uh, excuse me. I'm gonna have to go put something on this.

INT. CAR, DAY

HENRY:
Maybe they were telling you what they wanted you to know, not what you needed to know.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

It falls into place for SHAWN.

SHAWN:
Whoa. (taps GUS on the chest before approaching the Fords) Lies! Lies! Lies! Lies! Yeah! You two. You were two young kids in way over your head with the militant SAG so you used Eugene as a scapegoat, didn't you? Set him up to take the fall for the police headquarters bombing so you could make a clean break. But then you heard he got out early, and you were afraid he'd come track you down and expose your criminal past.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. FORD HOUSE, KITCHEN, DAY

MELANIE:
We know he's been asking around town about us, trying to figure out our whereabouts. We thought he'd finally found us.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

SHAWN:
Because of the four members of SAG, only two of you are doin' okay for yourselves. Eugene has lost 30 years, and he will be marked as a criminal forever. And Dr. Colbert, his drinking destroyed his career. But you two, your life is picture-perfect. And you would kill to protect it. First, it was Dr. Colbert. His guilt-ridden conscience and drunk mouth would cause him to confess everything to Eugene. And then the plan was simple. Frame Eugene for that murder, and then blow Eugene up right along with all the traces to your past so you could move on to a very bright, white pickety future.

MELANIE:
That's a preposterous theory. Preposterous!

DEREK:
You have no proof.

SHAWN:
Oh, really? What if I did somethin' like this? (presses a few buttons and activates bomb)

LASSITER:
Spencer, what did you just do?

SHAWN:
In exactly one minute, we will all be blown to smithereens or the people responsible for making that bomb will deactivate it.

DEREK:
Don't look at me. He's crazy.

EUGENE:
Yeah, I don't know how to do it either.

LASSITER:
I demand that someone disarm this bomb right now!

GUS runs away. Officers clear the area of spectators. Everyone looks at the bomb as the seconds tick away. SHAWN looks up calmly from his watch to DEREK who breaks and stops the bomb. There are four seconds left. SHAWN leans against one of the cars.

LASSITER:
Arrest them.

Episode 3x06 There Might Be Blood

1987

EXT. SPENCER HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN is digging a hole in the yard while GUS watches.

GUS:
How can you be sure it's down there?

SHAWN:
I can feel it in my bones, Gus. All great oil wildcatters have that ability. Me, Getty, Clampett, Crisco and Wesson.

GUS:
(looks around) But your dad told us never to dig in the yard.

SHAWN:
My dad doesn't understand the concept of taking risks. All we have to do is find the oil, and that'll show him.

GUS:
(jumps in) Okay. Let's say we do find oil. What happens then?

SHAWN:
All of our dreams come true. I'll be rich, and you'll work for me.

HENRY comes home and hears water. He cuts through the house and sees a jet of water shooting up from the ground.

HENRY:
Hey! Hey! What the hell's going on here?

SHAWN and GUS are standing in the hole as the water falls on them.

SHAWN:
Hey, Dad, we were prospecting for oil. How was your day?

HENRY:
All right, look. There's grass seed and duct tape in the garage. I want this yard exactly as it was. I don't care if it takes you both all night, you understand?

The clear water turns muddy and the boys laugh in delight. HENRY just goes inside.

PRESENT DAY

EXT. OIL RIG PLATFORM, NIGHT

Workers are securing items due to the storm. One man is supervising from a raised platform.

SUPERVISOR:
You're bunching up over there! Let's go! Move that pipe. Let's go! All right, McCall, bring those forks in through here. Watch it now. Watch 'em. Easy on the tongs, Woodruss! Woodruss! Easy on the tongs. Don't break those chains! You two are bunching up over there. Let's move that pipe. Let's go! Hey! Hey! McCloud, watch that lift! Check your line, Aldridge! Hey, you! You! That's no man's land! Get away from there!

One worker has moved into the area clearly marked "Danger - Keep Out" along the railing. The SUPERVISOR hurries down the stairs and over to the worker.

SUPERVISOR:
Hey, buddy! I'm talking to you! Clear the area! (shoves the worker out of the way) Don't think I'm not gonna write you up!

A large hook breaks free and swings into No Man's Land, knocking him over the rail and into the sea below. The men hurry over to the edge to look for him.

INT. SBPD BOAT, CABIN, DAY

VICK is at the wheel, periodically checking the charts. SHAWN and GUS are standing just outside the door on the aft deck.

GUS:
Great, I'm missing a huge symposium on new frontiers in medical treatment, and I don't even know what for.

SHAWN:
What is that? The fungus one?

GUS:
Yeah. Don't play, Shawn, you know that fungus is my bread and butter.

SHAWN:
Really? You know what my bread and butter is? Bread and butter. Fungus has never entered into the equation. Not once. All the Chief said was that time was of the essence and that she'd brief us on the boat.

GUS:
I wonder what this case is about. It obviously has something to do with the ocean.

SHAWN:
Oh, Gus. It could be anything. Crab-on-crab violence. A gang war between the mermen and the shark people. Or maybe she wants to take us wild orca hunting.

VICK:
All right, guys. Come on up.

SHAWN and GUS enter the cabin.

VICK:
All right, here's the deal. A safety inspector named Butch Hicks fell to his death from an offshore oil rig last night and his body washed up on shore. The rig he was working on, is the Bamford number 7. That's where we're headed.

SHAWN:
First of all, let me just say, awesome! I've always wanted to go on an oil rig.

GUS:
Excuse me, Chief, but how is this a police matter? From what you've said, it's an accident.

VICK:
Yeah. That's what the Coast Guard thinks. But I'm not so sure. We received an anonymous tip about a week ago that we traced to a pay phone outside the dive shop on the pier. The caller said that something highly unsafe was going on out on that rig and that he was risking everything to warn us.

SHAWN:
Dude, harbor seal. (points out the window)

GUS:
What? (looks)

SHAWN:
Did you share this information about the anonymous tip with the Coast Guard?

VICK:
Absolutely not. I've had dealings with them in the past and I don't trust 'em.

SHAWN:
If you suspect foul play, shouldn't your lead detective be here? Where's Lassie?

GUS:
And Juliet? Shouldn't she be here?

VICK:
Okay, well, the truth is, um, what we're doing isn't exactly... We're acting more in an unofficial capacity, and any more questions and I'm gonna turn this boat around, take you both back to shore, understood?

SHAWN:
I'm all right with that. Except that Gus' leg is touching mine.

GUS:
Is not.

SHAWN:
He keeps looking at my ear.

VICK:
Enough. Now we're gonna be there in about five...

A ship's horn blares as it comes up behind them.

WOMAN:
(over loudspeaker) This is the U.S. Coast Guard. Stop your engine and prepare to be boarded.

VICK:
Damn it. (stops the engine)

The Coast Guard boat comes alongside.

VICK:
I'll handle this. (picks up clipboard and leaves cabin)

EXT. SBPD BOAT, DECK, DAY

The woman officer walks along the gunwale.

VICK:
Good morning.

WOMAN:
(jumps onto the deck) Hey! Good morning. What brings you out here, Chief?

VICK:
Just doing a little sight-seeing.

WOMAN:
Yeah, is that right? (sees the clipboard) What's this? It's a rig manifest.  (takes clipboard) You wouldn't be thinking of nosing in on my accidental death case, would you? 'Cause that's my jurisdiction.

VICK:
(laughs) Sorry to break it to you, Commander, but according to the GPS, that southeast corner of the rig crosses back inside three miles, which brings it under my jurisdiction.

WOMAN:
Oh, you don't want to come up against me because you will lose.

VICK:
We'll see about that.

SHAWN:
(steps forward and shakes her hand) Hi, Commander, I'm Shawn Spencer, amateur dolphinologist, big fan of the briny and lemon squares.

VICK:
(whispers) Stay out of this, Mr. Spencer.

SHAWN:
Don't worry, Chief. I'm sure the Commander here is a perfectly reasonable human person. Huh? Here's the thing. We received an anonymous tip that there may be more going on here than meets the eye. So, with your blessing, of course, we'd like to go ahead and check out the rig. What do you say?

WOMAN:
Anonymous tip? You weren't gonna share this information with me?

VICK:
Like you ever shared anything with me.

WOMAN:
(pokes VICK) I could have you brought up on charges.

VICK:
(pokes WOMAN) You can't intimidate me.

WOMAN:
I'm giving you exactly ten seconds to get this vessel out of my waters. (slaps VICK'S arm)

VICK:
I'd like to see you make me. (slaps WOMAN)

WOMAN:
Oh, yeah?

VICK:
Oh, yeah.

WOMAN:
Oh, look! My nose is touching yours. What do you think about that?

GUS:
Can you do that to a Commander?

SHAWN:
You can when she's your sister.

VICK:
Don't you put your nose right up into mine again.

WOMAN:
What if I put it really close?

VICK:
What if I actually touch your nose?

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK is on the phone while her sister looks on.

VICK:
Yes, sir. I understand. (hangs up)

SISTER:
Judge ruled with me on jurisdiction, didn't he?

VICK:
Yeah. But that doesn't change the fact that I have far more experience investigating homicides.

SISTER:
But this wasn't a homicide. This was an accident.

VICK:
You don't know that for certain.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS watch the sisters argue.

GUS:
I can't get over it. After all this time, the Chief never said she had a sister.

SHAWN:
It's strange.

LASSITER:
(comes up behind them) And such an alluring sister at that.

SHAWN:
Creepy.

JULIET:
(joins them) You should hear this. I got the Commander's bio off the Coast Guard web site.

SHAWN:
(takes paper from JULIET, clears throat and starts to read) "Commander B... "

JULIET:
(takes paper back) "Commander Barbara Dunlap. Graduated U.S. Coast Guard Academy with honors conducted multiple search and rescue operations Kodiak, Alaska, assumed command Santa Barbara station 2002. To date, interdicted over $5 million of illegal narcotics and has saved 57 lives."

SHAWN whistles and LASSITER is impressed.

JULIET:
Very impressive.

LASSITER:
Impressive and intoxicating. I mean, all that power in one woman? (looks at paper) There's no photo.

SHAWN:
Creepier.

VICK and BARBARA exit the office, still arguing.

BARBARA:
I know that I don't care about your so-called experience, okay? You are not getting anywhere near my oil rig.

VICK:
Well, too bad because we have a psychic, (points) Mr. Spencer, who is gonna figure out who our anonymous tipster is, which could be pretty darn important to the investigation.

BARBARA:
Yes, it could. And since this is now in my jurisdiction, your psychic (points) is my psychic.

VICK glares at SHAWN.

SHAWN:
I...

LASSITER pushes past SHAWN to introduce himself.

LASSITER:
Commander, Carlton Lassiter, head detective. (shakes her hand) I had no idea that the Chief had such an accomplished younger sister.

VICK:
(through gritted teeth) She's older.

LASSIITER realizes his mistake with a silent "Oh" and changes the subject.

LASSITER:
O'Hara, what are you doing standing there? We have a missing persons case to work.

LASSITER and JULIET walk away.

BARBARA:
Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but I have an investigation to conduct. Spencer, are you coming?

SHAWN:
Yes. May we have a moment with the Chief, Commander?

BARBARA:
Meet me at the ship. And I'll see you in an hour. Don't be late. (leaves)

SHAWN:
All right, Chief, I only said yes so that we can...

VICK:
You don't owe me an explanation. You do what you have to do. (goes into office)

SHAWN:
Is it just me, or does she seem peeved?

EXT. MARINA, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk from the lot to the dock.

GUS:
All I'm saying is, so much for us being in Chief Vick's good graces. We may have burned our bridge with her.

SHAWN:
Don't be a myopic Chihuahua. I have a foolproof plan that not only solves the case, gives Chief all the credit.

GUS:
What is it?

SHAWN:
All I have is the phrase, "I have a foolproof plan". Beyond that, I'm wide open.

SHAWN stops when they arrive at the dive shop. He sees a camera, a nautilus shell on the sign and the payphone.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

VICK:
We received an anonymous tip about a week ago that we traced to a pay phone outside the dive shop on the pier.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

SHAWN:
Okay, research time.

They walk down the ramp.

SHAWN:
Give me everything you got on offshore oil rigs.

GUS:
All right. Generally, oil platforms are located on a continental shelf.

SHAWN:
Shelf. Got it.

GUS:
A typical platform has around 30 well-heads.

SHAWN:
30, check.

GUS:
Drilling continues 24 hours a day, there are two crews on board at all times. One for the day shift, one for the night shift.

SHAWN:
"Love brokers."

GUS looks at him questioningly.

SHAWN:
Night Shift. Come on, dude. You got the Fonz playing against type.

They arrive at the slip, but the Coast Guard boat is gone.

GUS:
Where is this boat?

They see a young man in uniform.

SHAWN:
Excuse us. Is this where the Coast Guard boat launches from?

MAN:
Are you Shawn Spencer?

SHAWN:
I am indeed.

MAN:
Commander Dunlap instructed me to give you this. (takes off hat, takes out note and gives it to SHAWN)

SHAWN:
"Gentlemen, your job is to stay put and do nothing."

GUS takes the note and reads it himself.

GUS:
I don't believe this. She goes through all the trouble to hire us and then leaves us behind?

SHAWN:
Don't you see what's happening here, Gus? We are merely pawns in a bitter sibling feud.

GUS:
I'm nobody's pawn, Shawn. I'm a queen.

They look at each other, realizing what GUS said.

GUS:
At least I can make my conference on foot fungus. (turns to leave)

SHAWN:
(stops him) No, no, no. We cannot quit.

GUS:
Why not?

SHAWN:
Because we're not quitters. We're doing this for the Chief, remember? We've gotta get on that rig.

GUS:
But how?

MAN:(off-screen)
Have a good trip, Mr. Bamford.

SHAWN turns around and sees an older, heavyset man in a very Texan/Western outfit complete with Stetson. He is with a younger woman as they walk down the ramp.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

VICK:
The rig he was working on is the Bamford number 7, that's where we're headed.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

SHAWN:
I have an idea. But we'll need cool names.

INT. LAUNCH, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are sitting on the BAMFORD launch, having talked their way on.

DAUGHTER:
So, Mr. Turner...

SHAWN:
Please, call me T-Bone.

DAUGHTER:
(sits next to SHAWN) Okay, T-Bone, have you two invested in offshore drilling before?

SHAWN:
(laughs) Have we... Yes, Lordy, yes.

DAUGHTER:
So, you're familiar with the technology?

SHAWN:
I'd say it's pretty straight forward. You got your basic rig with 30 warheads, sitting on the continental countertop, running 24 crews day and night every two hours.

DAUGHTER:
That made absolutely no sense.

GUS:
The truth is, no, we're not that sophisticated in the oil business.

DAUGHTER:
I didn't think so. Look, my father and I don't appreciate our time being wasted.

BAMFORD:
(enters) You'll have to pardon my daughter, gentlemen. Apparently, Yale University didn't teach her any manners, or how to get a husband. Honey, run down there into the galley mix us up some cocktails while the men talk.

DAUGHTER:
Sure. (leaves)

SHAWN:
Wow. Not to be rude, Billy Joe, but it's the 21st century, women have earned the right to be treated equally.

BAMFORD:
(sits next to SHAWN) Cut the crap, son. A blind man could see that you two aren't investors.

SHAWN:
Technically, a blind man can't see anything, Billy Joe.

BAMFORD:
I offered you a ride out here so I could take a look at you, figure out what you were up to. What are you? Government watchdogs? EPA? Is this about that little oil spill?

GUS:
You had an oil spill out here?

BAMFORD:
(hesitates with fake smile) No.

SHAWN:
The truth, Billy Joe, is that we have not been completely honest with you. We're working for the Coast Guard.My name is Shawn Spencer. This is my partner, Chesterfield McMillan, and wife. We are investigating the death of your safety inspector, Butch Hicks, and whether or not it was truly an accident.

GUS:
But we were running late, so we missed the boat ride out here.

BAMFORD:
As much as I don't appreciate being lied to, if you're right about Hicks's death not being an accident, I want to know about it as much as you do. What can I do to help you?

SHAWN:
Well, the first thing we'll need to see is Mr. Hicks' personal effects. And I will be needing a little baby umbrella in my mai tai.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET are walking the hall.

LASSITER:
What's our, uh, missing person's name again?

JULIET:
Dr. Christopher Renaud. He's a professor at the university.

LASSITER:
And last seen?

JULIET:
His 3:00 lecture on Thursday.

LASSITER:
All right, we're gonna need a, uh, list of all the people in attendance that day.

JULIET:
I've obtained a list from the TA. And I've set up interviews with each and every one of his students.

LASSITER:
(sits at his desk) Good work, O'Hara. Ooh, one more thing.

JULIET:
(sits next to him) Shoot.

LASSITER:
I am thinking of asking out Commander Dunlap on a date. Your thoughts. (picks up sandwich)

JULIET:
(holding her pwn sandwich) Um, well, uh, I think it's a bad idea, Carlton.

LASSITER:
Really? Why?

JULIET:
Um, well, for starters, you know, she's the Chief's sister. Not to mention, they don't get along. You saw the way they were screaming at each other.

LASSITER:
See it? I devoured it. It was incredible. That Barbara, she's a real snap pea, isn't she? (takes bite) Mmm. She's got that great sturdy build.

JULIET:
Yeah. You know, why don't we focus on interviewing our witnesses for the missing persons case, hunh?

LASSITER:
Mmm. Absolutely. Yeah. Forget I even mentioned that other thing.

JULIET:
I will. (leaves)

LASSITER takes another bite of his sandwich.

EXT. OIL RIG, PLATFORM, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and BAMFORD arrive on the platform.

SHAWN:
Now, there was an anonymous tip that something unsafe was going on out here. Any clue as to what the caller might have been referring to?

BAMFORD:
I got no idea. This place is run strictly by the book. Butch Hicks made sure of that, and so do I. You can ask anybody. My professional reputation is based on safety. Watch your head going in here now.

INT. OIL RIG, HALL, DAY

They head down a set of stairs.

BAMFORD:
Somebody put a rail on this side of this ladder. That's a violation. Here's Hicks's office.

SHAWN:
I see.

SHAWN tries the door to the Geology Lab right across the hall. It's locked.

SHAWN:
What's in here?

BAMFORD:
That's the geologist's lab. My daughter's trying to get me all high-tech. She thinks because I punched a few dry holes that I've lost my touch. And she talked me into hiring this fancy rock doctor to show me where to dig. I don't need nobody to tell me where to dig. Once this well comes in, like I know it's going to, I'm gonna be back on top again.

SHAWN sees a chart on the wall with the Bamford #7 marked on it.

BAMFORD:
(opens the door to the office) You guys take your time. If you need me, I'll be topside.

GUS goes in and SHAWN pauses at the door.

SHAWN:
If you need us, we'll be bottoms-up.

INT, OIL RIG, OFFICE, DAY

GUS starts looking at hanging clipboards while SHAWN looks into cabinets.

GUS:
So what are we looking for?

SHAWN:
Anything that will help us figure out who the anonymous tipster was. Or a Kit Kat. I'm starving. Since Hicks was in charge of safety on the rig, it's safe to assume the tipster may have come to him first.

GUS:
I have this big stack of safety violation reports. Man, this guy Hicks was a real stickler.

SHAWN:
If by stickler, you mean a guy who doesn't have any snacks, I agree with that.

SHAWN finds an oxygen tank with a label on it from the dive shop on the pier. BARBARA enters with two Coast Guard.

BARBARA:
What are you two doing here?

SHAWN:
Not eating candy, I can tell you that.

BARBARA:
My orders for you were to stay put and do nothing.

SHAWN:
Really, that wasn't reverse-psychology?

BARBARA:
Out.

SHAWN:
Wait. I was drawn to this office with very powerful psychic visions of a man in scuba gear, with a salamander in his wetsuit.

BARBARA:
Well, thank you, Mr. Spencer, but I don't see how that's helpful.

GUS:
Or healthy.

SHAWN:
Wait, I'm seeing more. The anonymous tipster. I can tell you where he is.

BARBARA:
Really? And where's that?

SHAWN:
The morgue. Commander, look, my myriad psychic detective skills assure me that the anonymous tipster is Safety Inspector Butch Hicks.

BARBARA:
Your psychic detective skills?

SHAWN:
You left out myriad.

BARBARA:
Right.

SHAWN:
But wait, there's more. I see a security camera in front of the dive shop. All you have to do is review Friday's tape and you'll see that I'm right.

BARBARA:
Fine, let's say you are right. It doesn't change anything. All the evidence still points to his death being an accident. Let's go.

BARBARA jerks her head towards the door and SHAWN and GUS leave.

EXT. OIL RIG, PLATFORM, DAY

SHAWN, GUS, BARBARA and her two officers exit onto the platform.

BARBARA:
As long as I'm in charge of this case, you will follow my orders to the letter. And my orders are that you get off this rig! We have a shuttle leaving in an hour, you will be on it! (pushes past them)

SHAWN:
Is it just me, or is that woman a tinge bossy?

GUS:
She scares me.

SHAWN:
Let's hop to it. We have less than an hour to interview every worker on the night shift.

GUS:
No, Shawn. Let's discuss something that won't get us into trouble, like where we're gonna eat when we get back to shore. All that Kit Kat talk made me hungry.

SHAWN:
Dude, this may be the only chance we have to weed out who might have wanted to kill Hicks.

GUS:
If the Commander finds us, she's gonna go ape. (sniffs) Do I smell meatloaf?

SHAWN:
And fresh apple cobbler, if I'm not mistaken.

GUS:
I guess it won't hurt to ask a few questions.

SHAWN nods in the direction of Miss Bamford who is using her phone. They walk over and SHAWN puts on an accent out of a Western.

SHAWN:
Well, hello, Miss Ashley. Would you kindly direct my buddy and I to the chuck wagon, please?

ASHLEY:
I'm sorry?

GUS:
We would like to know where the mess hall is.

ASHLEY:
It's two decks down.

SHAWN:
Awesome. Would you like to have lunch with us? Perhaps, afterwards, you could give us a little tour?

ASHLEY:
(laughs) Look, regardless of how my father treats me, I'm not the cruise director here. (leaves)

INT. OIL RIG, MESS HALL, DAY

SHAWN gets a spoonful of food dropped on his plate by the server behind the counter.

SHAWN:
So, tell me about the safety inspector.

SERVER:
That guy was always writing me up for the smallest infraction. I hate to say it, but I'm glad he's dead.

SHAWN:
(makes a face) There's no dairy in that, is there?

GUS is sitting at a table attempting to eat. He's questioning a female WORKER.

WORKER:
(mouthful) You know, I had a dream that I knifed him in his sleep. But I woke up.

GUS puts down his fork. Later, SHAWN and GUS are sitting at a table with another worker.

WORKER 2:
Hicks should have never gone into no man's land.

SHAWN:
No man's land?

WORKER 2:
It's the area that's strictly off-limits during crane operation. Hicks should have known better. I mean, he was a safety inspector. Anyway, it's a shame if someone loosened that tackle and killed him.

GUS:
You know, you're the first person to show any empathy for Hicks.

WORKER 2:
What? (looks at them and laughs) No, I'm saying if it was me, I would have used a gun.

Later, SHAWN and GUS are clearing their trays.

SHAWN:
This place is lousy with suspects. And excessively heavy food. I think I ate my weight in that cowboy chicken casserole.

GUS:
Man, this food was disgusting. All I had was a half a bran muffin. What's our next move?

SHAWN:
Well, I think we need to get into Hicks' house. If there really was a conspiracy to kill him, we're gonna need hard evidence.

GUS:
When we get back to shore, we go see Chief Vick.

SHAWN:
Well, first we go home, change into our jammies, take a nap. Then we wake up, have some juice, then straight to Vick.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is on the phone at her desk.

JULIET:
All right. Well, call me if anyone matching that description shows up. Thanks. (hangs up)

SHAWN and GUS arrive.

SHAWN:
Hey, Jules. Chief in her office?

JULIET:
Ladies room.

SHAWN:
Darn. Gus and I really need to speak to her. Think you can give us a numeral so we can gauge just how long she'll be?

JULIET:
Oh, I don't know. Five, seven minutes maybe.

SHAWN:
How about number one or number two?

JULIET:
I have no idea, Shawn. And no, I am not gonna go to the ladies' room and check on her for you.

SHAWN:
(picks up photo) Is this your missing person?

JULIET:
Dr. Christopher Renaud. (takes photo back) He's a professor at the university. Been missing for a week.

VICK joins them.

VICK:
What are you two doing here?

SHAWN:
Oh, we have our answer.

GUS:
Tinkle.

SHAWN:
Chief, we need your help.

VICK:
Oh, you need my help? Oh, I've got to give you credit, Mr. Spencer. You have more than your share of gumption.

GUS:
Please, Chief. This will only take a minute.

SHAWN:
Come on. For old times' sake.

VICK:
(holds up her finger) One minute. No more.

VICK heads to her office and SHAWN and GUS follow.

SHAWN:
Chief, I read every single worker on that rig.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK opens the door and they enter.

GUS:
And they all hated Hicks.

SHAWN:
I'm getting two very distinct psychic vibes here.

VICK closes the door behind them.

SHAWN:
The first, there was a conspiracy behind Hicks' death. Second, Craig T. Nelson will donate his remaining hair to the Smithsonian.

GUS:
Yeah. Look, Chief, we need help learning more about Hicks, and a good start would be access to where he lived.

SHAWN points at GUS.

VICK:
I still don't understand why you're coming to me with this. I mean, why don't you go to the Commander?

SHAWN:
She really doesn't want us involved with this case.

VICK:
Really? Imagine that. I'm sorry. I can't help you. As the Commander pointed out, this case is out of my jurisdiction. And your minute is up. (walks to her desk)

SHAWN:
Gus, will you excuse us? I need to speak with the Chief in private.

GUS:
No problem. Just so you know, it was Shawn's idea for us to go with your sister. (waves and leaves)

SHAWN turns to face VICK sitting at her desk.

SHAWN:
Karen, Chief Karen. Chief Karen Vick? That just feels a little long, doesn't it?

VICK:
I said I'm busy, Mr. Spencer.

SHAWN:
I'm sensing something here... (puts hand to his head)

VICK:
Don't do that. (points at him)

SHAWN:
(lowers hand) Look, the only reason I took this case was to help you.

VICK:
Oh, really? Help me how?

SHAWN:
If I can tie that murder to a piece of evidence on land, the case is back in your jurisdiction.

VICK:
Well, that's actually kind of sweet. Don't tell anyone I used that word.

SHAWN:
Deal. (sits) Now I know it's none of my business, but what is going on with you and Commander Babs?

VICK:
It's complicated.

SHAWN:
Believe me, I know what it feels like growing up with an older sister who gets all the attention.

VICK:
I didn't know you had an older sister, Spencer.

SHAWN:
I don't. But I did watch a lot of reruns of The Brady Bunch.

VICK:
You know, Barbara and I weren't always like this. I mean, we used to be, well, close.

SHAWN:
I know exactly how you feel. And by I, I mean Jan.

VICK makes a long-suffering face.

SHAWN:
So, was it something specific that brought things to a head?

VICK:
No, nothing specific. It's just years of trying to outdo each other.

SHAWN:
(sighs) So, should I go divine that piece of evidence I was referring to?

VICK:
I don't know. Should you?

SHAWN smiles then leaves.

INT. HICK'S HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter through an open window. GUS enters head-first and gets stuck.

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, buddy. (lifts the window) There we go. Right in there.

GUS stands and SHAWN closes the window.

SHAWN:
Wow, looks like Hicks' obsession with safety did not extend to his colon.

Practically every surface is covered with take-out containers and liquor bottles.

GUS:
Vick will go ballistic if she found out we broke in here.

SHAWN:
We didn't break in. The window was open. Now, come on!

GUS:
What the heck are we looking for anyway?

SHAWN:
Anything Hicks may have received with the threat of violence. Correspondence, angry phone messages, mash notes.

GUS:
Mash notes are love letters, Shawn. (walks to desk)

SHAWN:
Really? Remind me, I owe someone a huge apology.

GUS:
Let's start with this computer. I guess I have to break the pass code. (wiggles fingers)

GUS goes through a little preparation ritual as SHAWN joins him. SHAWN sees a fez, a fan and a fancy letter opener.

SHAWN:
Panther21.

GUS:
Panther21?

SHAWN:
Just try it.

GUS:
(types) That's it.

SHAWN:
(nods) Mmm-hmm.

GUS:
You got all that just from putting together things from around the room?

SHAWN:
No, it was written on the computer. I saw the reflection on the cd case.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN walks away. GUS checks the emails.

GUS:
All right. Almost all of his recent emails are from someone called bishop77. "Why haven't you called me back?" "The situation on the rig is getting more serious every day!" "Why are you ignoring me?" Dude, listen to this one. (waves SHAWN over) "If you don't do something about this, I'll go to the authorities."

SHAWN:
Dude, you know what this means? Bishop77 is the anonymous tipster, not Hicks.

GUS:
And if we could figure out who he is, we could find out what's really going on out on that rig.

SHAWN:
And who killed Hicks, and why. Bishop77. He's Catholic, or he plays chess.

GUS:
I got it. I got it. A guy at work showed me how to take an email address and get its owner's real name. I'll start by using an email header to trace back to the original IP address.

SHAWN leans in close to watch and GUS sniffs him.

SHAWN:
What? Dear God, what are you doing?

GUS:
Shawn, what did I tell you about eating onions during lunch? It makes your breath stink. That's why I bought you those mints. Use them.

SHAWN:
(breathes into hand) Dude, I didn't eat onions during lunch. I ate everything but onions. I don't smell anything.

GUS continues to sniff and it leads him to a closet. SHAWN ignores GUS and breathes into his hand again.

SHAWN:
That smells good. That smells really good.

GUS:
Dude! It's coming from inside here.

SHAWN:
Well, open it up.

SHAWN walks over and GUS opens the closet door. The body of a dead man falls forward and GUS catches it out of reflex while SHAWN steps back.

GUS:
(grunts) Why does it always have to be a dead guy?

SHAWN:
Why does he smell like onions?

GUS:
Will you help me?

SHAWN gingerly takes an arm as GUS pushes the body back into the closet.

GUS:
Who do you think it is?

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN:
(picks up photo) Is this your missing person?

JULIET:
Dr. Christopher Renaud.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

SHAWN:
That's Lassiter and Juliet's missing person.

GUS lets go and the body falls to the floor.

EXT. HICK'S HOUSE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stand on the sidewalk and hear sirens. From the right comes the Coast Guard and from the left, the SBPD. Both vehicles stop with a squeal of brakes, merely inches separating the front bumpers. VICK gets out of the car accompanied by LASSITER and JULIET. BARBARA get out of her vehicle with two other officers.

VICK:
(approaches SHAWN) Mr. Spencer, what's this about?

BARBARA:
(hurries forward) Whoa, whoa, wait, he works for me. Mr. Spencer, what's this about?

SHAWN:
Look, the reason I called the two of you is because there's something in this house that concerns you both.

SHAWN leads them through the gate and up the front walk.

VICK:
Oh, please don't tell me you went into Hicks' house without a warrant.

BARBARA:
Hey! Warrant? No one talked to me about a warrant.

SHAWN:
(stops on steps) I need a warrant, all of a sudden? I'm a diviner! It all happens here. (waves his fingers by his head) And here. (by his heart) And, in extreme cases, here. (GUS' face)

GUS slaps SHAWN'S hand away.

VICK:
Okay, what exactly is in there?

SHAWN:
A missing person. Professor... Renaud?

JULIET:
That's our missing person. But we never found a connection between he and Hicks.

LASSITER:
We'll check it out.

JULIET and LASSITER enter the house.

VICK:
What would Renaud be doing in Hicks' house?

BARBARA:
And how does this affect my case?

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa. Wait, I'm getting something.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. OIL RIG, HALL, DAY

BAMFORD:
Talked me into hiring this fancy rock doctor to show me where to dig. Well, I don't need anybody to show me where to dig.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

SHAWN:
Renaud worked as a consulting geologist for Hicks' employer, Bamford Exploration.

LASSITER and JULIET exit the house.

JULIET:
It's Renaud.

LASSITER:
Spencer's right. Not words I enjoy saying.

VICK:
Okay, then.

SHAWN:
Well, I'd say that ties up the missing person case quite nicely. This is usually the place where you say, "Nice work, Spencer."

VICK mumbles.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, Chief. I didn't catch that.

BARBARA:
So, uh, the victim worked for Bamford Drilling. What does that have to do with Hicks' murder?

SHAWN and GUS look at each other.

VICK:
You know, if you don't mind, let me ask the questions now. Because in case you haven't noticed, we're on land, which brings this case back into my jurisdiction.

BARBARA:
Listen to yourself, will you? "My jurisdiction." You're only interested in this case because you're itching to horn in on my turf.

VICK:
Itching? (scoffs) Listen to yourself! Your turf? We're talking about a whole ocean, not the TV room!

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, sisters, please! Nobody's getting horned here! Two men are dead! This is not the time for petty sibling squabbles. That's what Thanksgiving is for. We need to come together and work as a group to get to the truth. And the truth is... Renaud is our anonymous tipster, not Hicks.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

SHAWN voices his theory and we see how it could have played out.

INT. RENAUD'S OFFICE, DAY

Renaud is typing furiously at his computer.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
I can see a series of emails from Renaud to Hicks, the safety inspector, warning him that something unsafe was happening on that rig.

INT. HICK'S HOUSE, DAY

Renaud argues with Hicks.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
But Hicks, he refuses to address the issue, probably because he's covering something up. And then, fearing that the truth would get out, Hicks...

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

SHAWN makes the sound effect and hand motion of a hammer being used.

SHAWN:
Pssh! Stop! Hammer time! Whoosh!

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. HICK'S HOUSE, DAY

Hicks stands there briefly before turning away.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
Hicks kills Renaud. The question is, what was Hicks trying to hide?

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

VICK:
Thank you for that eloquent summation, Mr. Spencer.

SHAWN:
It's my pleasure, Chief. I think our next move should be...

VICK:
For me to have Lassiter and O'Hara now look into it.

VICK goes up the stairs into the house. LASSITER and JULIET follow. LASSITER is smiling.

LASSITER:
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, this is great. Barbara just witnessed the Chief choose me over Spencer. In her eyes, my stock just went up. Now if I could just get her to witness me discharge my weapon.

JULIET shakes her head as she follows.

BARBARA:
Well, Mr. Spencer, this case does warrant further investigation on my end as well.

SHAWN:
Absolutely. Thank you, Commander. I think the first thing we need to investigate is why Hicks was in no man's land. The safety inspector, of all people, should have known better.

BARBARA:
Yeah, and I'll have my people look into that. Oh, yeah. By the way, you're fired. (leaves)

GUS:
Fired? Nobody fires me, Shawn. What do we do next?

SHAWN:
I can't stop asking myself, why was the geologist's office the only door that was locked? I'm telling you, something was in there.

GUS:
We gotta get back on that rig. But how?

SHAWN:
I have an idea.

GUS:
Is it good?

SHAWN:
Not really.

EXT. MARINA, DAY

HENRY is on his boat, preparing to cast off when SHAWN and GUS run up.

SHAWN:
Dad! Whoa, whoa! Wait! Wait, wait! Ah, thank God!

HENRY:
Hey, Shawn! What are you doing here?

SHAWN:
Well, hey, you know what? Gus and I thought maybe we'd go out with you today.

HENRY:
Ah, that's a first. Every time I ask you to go out fishing, you come up with some lame excuse. What was it? Last time it was, uh, one word. "Books".

SHAWN:
(laughs) That's right. What can I say? We're both in the mood for some serious angling. Huh?

SHAWN and GUS climb aboard and sit.

SHAWN:
We heard the big ones are biting.

HENRY:
That's funny. I heard the storm scared all the fish away. Wait a minute, what did you hear was biting? It's not pike, is it?

SHAWN:
As a matter of fact, it was pike. Man, the pike is biting!

HENRY:
Yeah, well, pike is a freshwater fish. In case you morons haven't noticed, that's the ocean out there. All right, Shawn. What's up? What do you want?

SHAWN:
We believe the evidence we need to solve a case is on an offshore oil rig. It's the Bamford Number 7.

GUS:
We were hoping that you could give us a lift out there.

HENRY:
Can't do it.  Sorry, guys. Even if I was so inclined, this boat isn't designed to go out that far.

SHAWN:
Dad, come on, this is important. It's not just about solving the case. We gotta get back in Vick's good graces.

HENRY:
Shawn, cannot do it.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Shocking.

SHAWN and GUS stand.

HENRY:
But I, uh, I think I got a friend over here. Captain Dale might be able to help you out.

They look over at a beat-up, dirty boat. DALE looks a typical old-salt type, throwing chum off the stern.

HENRY:
Of course, you'll have to do some chores.

SHAWN:
Chores?

DALE waves.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

BARBARA knocks on the door and peeks her head in.

BARBARA:
Hey, can I come in?

VICK:
What do you want, Barb? Here to argue some more about jurisdiction?

BARBARA:
Actually, no. (enters)

VICK:
Yeah, well, I have a lot of work to do, so...

BARBARA:
Well, the thing is, I had my people look into what Spencer said. (sits) What was Hicks doing out in no man's land? Uh, did somebody lure him out there? So, I took a trip out to the rig, had a look at the crane. It turns out the crane had been tampered with. Hicks was murdered. I was wrong.

VICK:
Um, Spencer was right. (hands BARBARA file) About Hicks murdering Renaud. His prints were all over the murder weapon.

BARBARA:
(tosses file onto desk) Well, then, we need to find Spencer and see what else he's figured out.

VICK:
Lead the way.

BARBARA:
Can I?

VICK:
Yeah.

BARBARA:
Let's go.

The sisters leave. VICK smiles.

INT. OIL RIG, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS sneak down the stairs outside the geology lab. SHAWN works the lock.

GUS:
Damn that Captain Dale. I still smell like fish. I hate fish.

SHAWN:
That's not true. You love my Cajun crawfish hushpuppies.

GUS:
That's mostly cornmeal, and you know that!

SHAWN gets the lock and they enter the lab.

INT, OIL RIG, LAB, DAY

GUS switches on the light and closes the door behind them. SHAWN hold up something in his hand and GUS takes it and examines it.

GUS:
Look what you did to my credit card! You ruined it!

SHAWN:
Dude, it had a 29.7% interest rate. I did you a favor. Stop complaining. Start looking.

GUS rubs the card against the edge of the counter. SHAWN opens the top drawer of a wide file cabinet.

SHAWN:
You good on litmus paper?

GUS huffs and begins looking at some spiral-bound books. SHAWN tries the second drawer but finds it locked. He takes out his Swiss Army knife and uses one of the blades on the lock. He pulls out a transparent film with some writing on it.

SHAWN:
Huh.

GUS walks over.

GUS:
What the heck is that?

SHAWN:
Looks like a map. "BR#7"

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

INT. OIL RIG, HALL, DAY

BAMFORD:
I don't need nobody to tell me where to dig.

While BAMFORD is talking, SHAWN sees the chart map on the wall.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

SHAWN:
Why would Renaud hand draw a map that already existed? Remember that map we saw in the corridor?

GUS:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
Yeah, go grab it.

GUS heads for the door.

INT. OIL RIG, HALL, DAY

GUS steps into the hall but pulls back against the wall as one of the workers passes by. As soon as he's able, he dashes across the hall, grabs the map and then goes back into the lab.

INT, OIL RIG, LAB, DAY

GUS sets the map down on the counter and SHAWN places the transparency over top. He matches the coastline on both pieces. The transparency shows they are drilling on a fault line, not where they say on the "official" map.

SHAWN:
That's what Renaud meant when he said they were doing something unsafe. They're not drilling where they say they're drilling.

GUS:
They're drilling directly on a fault line.

SHAWN and GUS start to leave when ASHLEY enters.

ASHLEY:
This is a private lab. What are you two doing in here?

SHAWN:
Dude, I got this. Ashley, the truth is that I'm a psychic. A damn good one, I've been told. I am sensing that there is stuff going on that will be hard for you to hear. (puts his hands on her arms) Very hard. (feels her arms) Very, very hard. Damn, girl, you are so lean. What, do you spin?

GUS:
Shawn, I thought you said you got this.

SHAWN:
Sorry. I'm... I'm seeing faults. Faulty something. Faulty intelligence. Faulty wiring. Fawlty Towers.

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
Fault. Your father is drilling into a fault line.

ASHLEY:
What?

SHAWN:
Yeah, he made a fake map with the help of Dr. Dre. No, uh, Dr. Pepper, no! Dr. No... Dr. Renaud. Renaud!

ASHLEY:
Our geologist.

SHAWN:
That's right. There's more. Unfortunately, I think your father may be responsible for the deaths of Dr. Renaud and Hicks. I think he's trying to cover his tracks.

ASHLEY:
I'm... I'm sorry. I can't believe that Dad would do that. I mean, he's always been a risk-taker, willing to gamble everything if he thought there was oil to be found. But I can't believe that he would do this. I feel sick.

SHAWN:
It's okay. We're gonna get through this together. Probably over dinner. I was thinking tapas, but I could be talked into Greek...

GUS:
Shawn!

ASHLEY:
We need to stop drilling immediately.

SHAWN:
Right. And as far as dinner goes, let's just put a pin in it.

ASHLEY puts a hand to his face in a light caress before turning away. SHAWN smiles.

ASHLEY:
The communications room is down the hall. We'll radio up to the floor and tell them to suspend operations.

They leave the lab.

INT. OIL RIG, ROOM, DAY

ASHLEY opens the door to a dark room.

ASHLEY:
The light is on the opposite wall. I'll turn on the radio.

GUS heads deeper into the room.

SHAWN:
I know it isn't easy, hearing that your father isn't who you thought he was. (walks into the room) But you're doing the right thing.

GUS turns on the light to reveal they are in a supply closet.

GUS:
This is the radio room?

ASHLEY pulls a gun on them. They put their hands up.

SHAWN:
Ashley! Sweetie pop! (laughs nervously) Come on now.

ASHLEY:
You shouldn't have come back out here, Shawn. Now I'm gonna have to figure out a way to get rid of you.

ASHLEY leaves and locks the door behind her. SHAWN points at GUS a few times.

SHAWN:
I might have made a mistake. She fills those jeans out quite nicely, though.

GUS:
(sees sign on the door) Shawn, that sign says "toxic fumes". I am breathing in toxic fumes!

SHAWN:
Come on, dude. You think the company's gonna expose employees to stuff that's really harmful?

GUS:
(gets into SHAWN'S face) Did you not see Silkwood, Shawn? They're gonna make me take a shower where they scrub my skin off!

EXT. OIL RIG, PLATFORM, DAY

ASHLEY hurries across the platform. VICK, BARBARA, LASSITER and JULIET arrive.

VICK:
Miss Bamford! Can we talk to you?

ASHLEY:
Um, can it wait? I'm really busy.

BARBARA:
No, no, no sorry, honey. It can't wait.

VICK:
See, we know that Hicks' death wasn't an accident, that he was murdered.

BARBARA:
It looks like we have solid alibis from everybody on the rig that night.

JULIET:
But the helicopter pilot who brought the workers out for their shift said there was an extra passenger who wasn't on the manifest.

VICK:
That passenger was you, Miss Bamford.

BARBARA:
Yeah. We're hoping you could clear this up for us. Why were you out there that night? And why didn't you want your name on the manifest?

ASHLEY:
Oh, well, that's simple. I was, um... You see, sometimes I like to make surprise visits.

The wind blows her jacket, revealing her gun.

LASSITER:
She's got a weapon! (moves to cover the women)

Everyone pulls their own weapons and chase her back inside.

VICK:
Halt!

INT. OIL RIG, HALL, DAY

ASHLEY runs down the stairs and fires back.

INT. OIL RIG, CLOSET, DAY

SHAWN and GUS hear the gunshots.

SHAWN:
(goes to the door) We gotta get outta here.

GUS:
Shawn, I think the rule is when you hear gunfire, you don't go towards it.

SHAWN:
(pounds on door) We're in here! We're in here! We're in here!

INT. OIL RIG, HALL, DAY

VICK and BARBARA come down the stairs, weapons drawn, cautiously searching.

INT. OIL RIG, CLOSET, DAY

SHAWN:
We're in here!

The door unlocks and opens. SHAWN and GUS take up defensive positions only to be relieved when LASSITER and JULIET enter.

SHAWN:
Oh, Jules, Lassie. Thank God. It's Ashley Bamford. She's armed.

LASSITER:
We know. We're in pursuit. (points emphatically) You two stay put. Do you understand?

GUS:
Got it.

SHAWN waits briefly for the detectives to leave before heading for the door.

GUS:
(stops him) What part of "stay put" is confusing to you?

SHAWN:
The "put" part. Stay put? I wasn't put in the first place, Gus. The expression is a complete disaster. Ooh, look!

SHAWN points behind GUS and when he turns to look, SHAWN runs out. With a grunt of frustration, GUS follows.

INT. OIL RIG, DAY

VICK and BARBARA have cornered ASHLEY in some sort of pump room with lots of pipes, valves and steam. Both parties are hiding behind pipes.

BARBARA:
What's her 20?

VICK:
On the left. 30 feet.

BARBARA:
No, it's more like 35 feet.

VICK:
Damn it, why do you always have to feel like you have to correct me?

BARBARA:
Was I correcting you? I didn't mean to correct...

VICK:
Yeah!

BARBARA:
I'm sorry.

ASHLEY fires, BARBARA ducks and VICK fires back. JULIET and LASSITER arrive, taking cover behind another set of pipes. SHAWN and GUS sneak in, ducking low.

GUS:
What the hell are you doing?

SHAWN:
I have a plan. It's called "Gus is a table".

There is more gunfire. SHAWN and GUS duck lower. One of the valves is hit, releasing more steam.

GUS:
I'm a what?

SHAWN:
It was our signature prank in the seventh grade. I know you remember this. "Gus is a table."

GUS:
Let me get thi...

More shots are exchanged. LASSITER and JULIET rush towards ASHLEY'S position as she reloads.

GUS:
Let me get this straight. You want me to sneak up behind her on all fours, so you can push her, and she'll fall over me?

SHAWN:
Exactly. I'll distract her while you get in position.

SHAWN moves around so he's behind ASHLEY but still has cover.

SHAWN:
Ashley, hon?

ASHLEY:
(turns and aims) Shawn? Don't make me shoot you.

SHAWN:
(raises hands) It's okay. I just wanna talk. I'm putting my cards on the table. Right smack dab on the table!

Hiding, GUS shakes his head.

ASHLEY:
Doesn't matter. It's too late.

SHAWN:
Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no. It's not too late. (looks over at GUS) Gus is a table.

GUS:
Gus is a statue!

SHAWN:
You're a sellout!

ASHLEY:
What's going on? What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
(moves sideways) Nothing. Nothing, nothing. Nothing's going on.

ASHLEY:
Don't come any closer, Shawn.

BARBARA:
What is he doing?

VICK:
I have no idea.

JULIET:
Shawn, get out of there!

SHAWN:
Juliet, stay back. All of you, stay back. And stop shooting! Look, Ashley, I know what it feels like to have a dad that does not appreciate or respect you. Let me tell you what I see. I see a gorgeous young woman with a smart jacket, and an impressive education, and even more impressive arm muscle tone who desperately wanted to save her father's crumbling business. I know that's why you had Renaud make the fake map, so that nobody would know you were drilling into a dangerous fault line. And when Butch Hicks found out about it, you did what any good child would do in your place. You had no choice. You had to kill him.

The others make questioning faces as SHAWN talks.

ASHLEY:
I couldn't have let Hicks or anyone else get in the way. You understand that, don't you, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Of course I do. Are you kidding me? I completely understand. (walks up to her) What are you doing? (laughs) Give me that. Give me that gun. It's okay.

ASHLEY slowly hands over the gun. She looks ready to cry.

SHAWN:
Come here.

SHAWN opens his arms to hug her, but LASSITER runs out and tackles her. JULIET hurries over with her handcuffs. GUS stands by SHAWN.

LASSITER:
(whispers) Did Barbara see that?

VICK and BARBARA walk over. LASSITER gives BARBARA a cheesy grin.

VICK:
Well, I gotta say, Mr. Spencer, nice work.

SHAWN:
Thanks, Chief. No help to my table. No help to my table. (looks at GUS)

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are holding a large gift basket.

VICK:
This really isn't necessary. I already told you guys you're forgiven. In fact, I should be giving you gifts for bringing me and my sister back together.

SHAWN:
Chief, stop it. The only gift we'll ever need from you is your sweet, toothy smile.

GUS:
And any possible cases you might want to send our way.

SHAWN:
But mostly the toothy smile.

BARBARA:
(knocks on open door) Knock, knock, knock.

VICK:
Hey!

SHAWN:
Well, ahoy, Commander. Welcome aboard.

BARBARA salutes as she walks in.

GUS:
Thar she blows.

SHAWN:
All hands on deck.

BARBARA:
Okay, enough. The painfully cute mugging's starting to get on my nerves.

GUS:
What are you, Entertainment Weekly?

BARBARA:
So, we still on for lunch, Kare?

VICK:
Absolutely.

BARBARA:
(giggles) This is kind of awkward, but I'm thinking of asking out Detective Lassiter. What do you think?

SHAWN and GUS moan and turn away.

VICK:
Oh! Um... You don't want to go there.

BARBARA:
Really? Why?

VICK:
It's just he's a little, um, wound up. And trust me, you'd be far better off pursuing somebody else. I'm doing you a favor.

SHAWN and GUS start going through the food in the basket.

BARBARA:
I get it. You want him for yourself.

VICK:
What? No. I'm married, Barb. And even if I weren't, I mean, Carlton? Oh! Oh, no. No, no.

SHAWN reaches for food but GUS slaps him away.

BARBARA:
(mimics) Ah, no, no, no.

VICK:
No!

BARBARA:
(laughs) Oh, you are so transparent.

VICK:
Transparent?

BARBARA:
You can't stand to see me with someone you're attracted to! All of a sudden too, by the way.

VICK:
All of a... Transparent? Yeah, fine, you know what? Ask out Lassiter.

BARBARA:
I will!

VICK:
Go ahead!

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER walks by the office just as BARBARA steps out.

BARBARA:
You, me, lunch. (she points)

LASSITER:
(turns and follows) Aye, aye!

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and VICK watch as LASSITER hurries after BARBARA. VICK can't seem to believe it.

SHAWN:
So I take it the sibling rivalry is back on?

VICK:
Oh, it's on. And I am so winning.

As VICK walks away, SHAWN reaches again for the snacks GUS is holding. GUS slaps him again.

SHAWN:
Ouch! You have a problem.

Episode 3x07 Talk Derby to Me

1987

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

HENRY, in uniform, is standing in the living room.

HENRY:
Shawn? Shawn! Get in here a second.

GUS walks into the room.

HENRY:
Gus, what are you doing here?

GUS:
I'm representing Shawn in this situation.

HENRY:
Shawn, get in here!

SHAWN walks into the room.

HENRY:
Take a look around.

SHAWN:
Well, what am I looking at?

HENRY:
Something's missing. I took something of yours, you need to figure out what it is.

SHAWN:
Dad, you robbed me?

HENRY:
No, robbery's the taking of property by force or fear. I'm not afraid of anyone in this room.

GUS:
So you're a burglar, then?

HENRY:
No, Gus. Burglary involves breaking in. This is theft, pure and simple. You need to figure out what it is or you're not getting it back. Concentrate.

SHAWN looks around and spots three BB pellets on the floor and walks over. He pulls aside the curtain expecting to see something there.

SHAWN:
You thief! You stole my BB gun!

HENRY:
Technically, yes, theft makes me a thief. You're learning.

SHAWN:
So, can I have it back now?

HENRY:
No. I told you not to play with it in the yard. (sits) It's too dangerous.

SHAWN:
But you said if I figured out what was missing, I--

HENRY:
Shawn, thieves always lie. Remember that.

SHAWN:
How'd you even know I was playing with it in the backyard?

HENRY doesn't say anything. SHAWN looks over at GUS.

PRESENT DAY

INT. ZILK'S STORE, NIGHT

A security GUARD is patrolling the store. A figure rises up behind him and knocks him out. A group of four figures then begin stealing everything they can grab quickly as the alarm goes off. One looks at their watch as it counts down. The figure then motions to the others and they leave.

INT. ZILK'S STORE, DAY

The police have arrived and have marked the evidence. LASSITER and JULIET are there questioning the GUARD. VICK is conversing with an officer.

JULIET:
Mr. Coburn, we are interested in anything you can tell us.

COBURN:
They were big and scary, these guys.

JULIET:
Didn't you say you didn't see them?

COBURN:
That's... right.

LASSITER:
Of course, they were big and scary. Look at this place. The man's lucky to be alive.

JULIET:
Carlton, I've got this. What time did you begin your shift?

LASSITER looks up at a group of mannequins. He looks away.

COBURN:
8:00.

JULIET:
Are you the only watchman?

COBURN:
Yeah.

LASSITER looks again and one mannequin has changed position.

JULIET:
Would you mind showing me where you were standing at the time of the attack?

COBURN:
Yeah.

COBURN stands and walks JULIET over to where he was hurt.

COBURN:
I was walking through here...

LASSITER sees the mannequin has moved again. He walks over to the display.

LASSITER:
Spencer, what the hell are you doing up there?

SHAWN:
Right now, I'm putting my hand in my pocket, sans thumb, pointing at an imaginary seagull. (drops pose) But earlier I got a call from the Chief. She sounded serious. Third break-in of its kind in as many months. No leads.

LASSITER:
Chief told you that?

SHAWN:
No, she did. (turns to armless mannequin and pats its butt) She looks like the Venus de Milo, but she prefers to be called Traci with an "i." She saw everything. Said I should check the videos in the surveillance room.

LASSITER:
The mannequin told you that?

SHAWN:
No, the Chief did. Come on, Lassie, keep up with me here.

SHAWN tosses LASSITER his glasses and jumps off the display. We see GUS sitting on the display reading.

SHAWN:
Gus! I need you paying attention, do you think you can make that happen?

GUS:
I only opened my book for a second, Shawn. You know I have to study for my exam.

SHAWN:
Right. The RX... something.

GUS:
RX Rep, RX. Pharmaceutical rep re-certification exam. (jumps off display and drops book)

SHAWN:
That is the second worst name for a test ever. Right after the Proctological Practicum.

GUS:
(picks up book) Well, my job depends on it. And you said you were gonna help me.

SHAWN:
I'm not sure how I can. You keep such sloppy notes. What is this green slime on your book? (points to back cover) Did you come from The Kids' Choice Awards?

GUS:
This place is filthy.

SHAWN:
Maybe it's a clue.

GUS:
Maybe it's urine.

SHAWN:
Smell it.

GUS:
I'm not gonna smell it. Are you gonna help me or not?

INT. ZILK'S STORE, SURVELLIENCE ROOM, DAY

COBURN is seated at the desk with VICK, JULIET, LASSITER, SHAWN and GUS crammed in the small room behind him. GUS is studying.

COBURN:
We've never had more than two people in this room.

SHAWN:
It's cozy, which means I'll need everyone's hands where I can see them. That means yours, too, Chief.

COBURN:
Who's this?

VICK:
That's our psychic, Shawn Spencer.

SHAWN:
Psychic, and treasurer of the American Wicker Council. I'm up for re-election. I'm running on a rattan platform.

COBURN:
(shakes SHAWN'S hand) Stuart.

SHAWN:
This is my favorite booster, Detective Carlton Lass...

LASSITER:
Would you just play the tape?

COBURN starts the tape and they all lean forward. LASSITER recognizes some of the moves.

LASSITER:
That's a lariat move. These guys are ex-military. No question.

JULIET:
And that one there is calling the shots, so there appears to be a pattern here.

VICK:
Well, detectives, when you know something, you could find me in my office. Excuse me. (pushes her way to the door)

LASSITER:
Ow!

SHAWN:
Hey, Chief!

They go back to watching the video. SHAWN sees something - a button, pin?

LASSITER:
All right, we definitely need to check out all the local paramilitary groups, the security contractors, ROTC.

SHAWN:
Santa Barbara Ladies Auxiliary.

LASSITER:
Huh?

SHAWN:
Oh, they're women. (leaves)

INT. ZILK'S STORE, DAY

GUS continues to study as SHAWN tries on clothes.

GUS:
It can't be women. This kind of thing took some kind of muscle.

SHAWN:
It's a little shocking, isn't it? (checks himself in mirror) Not as shocking as this. These are 31s and they're really pulling through here. Make yourself useful. Get me the 32s.

GUS:
I don't have time for this. Either you have something or you don't.

SHAWN sees more green slime in streaks on the floor.

SHAWN:
Got it! Let's go see the Chief. (starts walking away)

GUS:
You got it?

SHAWN:
Let's just say I've got suspects.

GUS:
Good. Let's go and give them their names. I got studying to do. How many suspects are we talking?

SHAWN:
Eh, give or take--

They walk through the security gate and SHAWN'S clothes set off the alarm.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK is sitting behind her desk. LASSITER and JULIET are sitting in front of it as SHAWN paces.

VICK:
80 suspects? Really, Mr. Spencer. It wouldn't be possible perhaps to narrow it down just a bit, would it?

SHAWN:
Not without help. It's a tight group, Chief. It's a clique. It's a sisterhood of the Ya-Ya variety. And it's gonna take a lot more than a smile and a pack of Pall Malls to get 'em to talk.

LASSITER:
Not a problem. Tough-to-crack suspects are right in my wheelhouse.

SHAWN:
Negative, we cannot go about this using a typical Lassitarian technique. We need someone on the inside.

VICK:
Are you saying you want to go undercover?

SHAWN:
Undercover? Yes. Me? No. Unfortunately, I'm not qualified for this sort of thing.

LASSITER:
Don't worry about it, Spencer. I've been itching to do some undercover work. And I've got a new moustache guy.

SHAWN:
(snaps fingers) I like where your head's at, because this is going to take a very specific skill set. (massages LASSITER'S shoulders) There is only one person in this room that can pull it off. (kneels with arm around LASSITER'S shoulder) I've just got one question. (to JULIET) Can you skate?

INT. ARENA, ROLLER DERBY TRACK, DAY

There is a match going on.

ANNOUNCER:
And it's looking like we're in for an excruciating jam as Maniac cuts through the pack like a machete. That defense had better get on the defensive or else!

We see JULIET is on the orange team. As a member of the pink team comes up alongside, JULIET jabs her in the face with her elbow and she goes down.

ANNOUNCER:
Ooh, look out below!

INT. ARENA, ROLLER DERBY TRACK, DAY

JULIET knocks down another player.

ANNOUNCER:
Berman Auditorium is about to become the garden of beatin'! And it's Miss Anthropy around the outside.

PLAYER:
Let me through!

HENRY, SHAWN and GUS are sitting track-side. HENRY is really getting into it and GUS is studying.

HENRY:
Don't let her through! Don't let her through! Pick her up! Pick her up! Somebody pick her up!

SHAWN:
I couldn't have called a better assignment.

HENRY:
Yeah, right. You're a rocket scientist. I thought the police had a suspect from the roller derby, like a month ago. Seven, seven...

SHAWN:
Seven Deadly Cinderella. Yeah, but it didn't go anywhere.

HENRY:
What did you find that got Chief Vick back onto this roller derby angle?

SHAWN:
Oh, just everything. The damage, the hand signals. The scuff marks on the floor were caused by 62-millimeter core composite competition skate wheels.

HENRY looks at him.

SHAWN:
Vick wouldn't buy it until I threw in some roller babble. But think about it, who better for a smash and grab job than an organized team?

HENRY:
You think they were all on wheels?

SHAWN:
At least one of them was.

HENRY:
What makes you so sure it was one of these teams?

SHAWN:
Gus, you want to take this one?

GUS:
(looks up) What?

SHAWN:
Check the schedule. These were the only two teams who were off on all the nights the break-ins occurred. We call that detective work. It's a rare and beautiful thing. Like clubbed thumbs.

GUS:
I don't know how we're gonna solve this case. These women scare me.

HENRY:
Are you kidding? It's a cake assignment. I used to do some security work for the roller derby back in the day. Now, those broads, they knew how to get the job done. This is-- I don't know. This is like a fashion show. These broads, they can't, they're not...they don't hit...

SHAWN:
And that's why we brought you down here, Pop, to hear you say "broads" repeatedly. But why don't you explain to us how all this works.

HENRY:
All right, do you see the one with the star on her helmet? She's the lead jammer. She scores points when she passes the opposing skaters.

We see the action as HENRY points it out.

HENRY:
All right, look at her. Right there. The one they call Fox? You see, she's reaching down. She's up to something. You see that piece of tape?

FOX puts a piece of tape of the back of the opposing #13.

HENRY:
Number 13, she's been marked. She's gonna get hit. She's gonna be taken down. Watch this. Watch it. Here it comes.

Pink 13 is slammed by a member of the orange team and falls to her stomach outside the circle of the track.

ANNOUNCER:
Oh, and there's another one for the suicide seats!

HENRY whoops and the team members high five.

ANNOUNCER:
It's happy times for Westwood, Wilde, and Captain Denise "Kamikaze" Fox.

SHAWN:
This is our only chance to snoop around, Gus. Let's go. (stands) Dad, you all right?

HENRY:
Hit her! No, hit her now! She's down!

SHAWN:
He's fine.

HENRY:
Would you-- hit!

SHAWN and GUS walk along the side of the track.

GUS:
What are we doing, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Well, for starters, we're both growing moustaches very, very slowly. (steps over player lying on the floor) But we're also investigating.

GUS:
This is Juliet's investigation. We're gonna blow her cover. We need to stay out of her way.

SHAWN:
You're exactly right, Gus.

They step over another player.

SHAWN:
Or we do the exact opposite. I vote for number two.

INT. ARENA, HALL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stop in the hall outside the locker room.

SHAWN:
Be my lookout.

GUS:
No, there's only a few minutes left, Shawn, and you want to go inside...

SHAWN enters the locker room. GUS leans on the wall and studies.

INT. ARENA, LOCKER ROOM, DAY

After making sure he's alone, SHAWN begins to check individual lockers. He finds the same watch he saw on surveillance. In the next, he finds tickets for a Caribbean cruise. He hears the door and hides. He sees one of the orange team skate over to the locker with the ticket. The woman leaves and SHAWN goes back to searching the lockers.

INT. ARENA, HALL, DAY

GUS is still studying when SHAWN walks out.

SHAWN:
Worst lookout ever. You didn't see the girl walk in?

INT. ARENA, ROLLER DERBY TRACK, DAY

JULIET is conversing with her teammates. She is going by the name "Maniac".

PLAYER 1:
And I round this corner, and there's Maniac. And I'm, like, "Where'd she go?" And she's, like, "Where'd who go?" She moves pretty good for fresh meat.

PLAYER 2:
That's totally a compliment. Where'd you learn to skate like that?

JULIET:
Oh, you know. College roller-skate team. And Xanadu.

They all laugh.

PLAYER 2:
That's funny. I get it.

Players 1 and 2 leave. After sharing a nervous laugh with FOX, JULIET follows them. Across the floor, SHAWN watches them.

GUS:
Dude, you are leering.

SHAWN:
And if by leering, you mean staring oddly in a creepy way, yes, but it's for an investigation, Gus. They're all scraped up from burglarizing. Burglarization? Burglarism.

GUS:
Of course, they're scraped up. It's a full-contact sport.

SHAWN:
Uh-huh? And since when do we get injuries underneath our elbow pads? And that's a glass cut on the other one. Check it out.

GUS looks at the sign girl.

SHAWN:
That's leering.

JULIET sees them and skates over.

JULIET:
(whispers) Shawn, what are you guys doing here?

SHAWN:
I'm moving on this case. I'm pretty sure I found the extra- sensory vortex in this building.

JULIET:
Where?

SHAWN:
Women's locker room, which as it happens, is a place I've always wanted to hang out, so it's totally a win-win.

JULIET:
Shawn, I get this is how you work, but this is not how we are going to be doing things. I am lead detective, and this is first and foremost a police investigation. So, if we are going to be partners, we are going to be doing things my way.

SHAWN:
All kidding aside, I got some serious vibes in there. And possibly athlete's foot.

JULIET:
Great, I'll check it out and come by your office later, but right now, I need you guys to get out of here!

FOX and PLAYER 2 skate over.

FOX:
Is this guy bothering you, Maniac?

JULIET:
Wilde, Fox, this is...

FOX:
I know who this guy is. We see gawkers like him all the time around here. Real easy to spot. There's always one thing off about them. Clothes, hair, teeth.

SHAWN:
You just named my three best features. Fourth on the list, posture. Fifth, elocution. (holds out hand) Maniacmaniac19, president pro-tem, Maniac Fan Club. This is my vice president, Longbranch Pennywhistle. I'm just looking to score a little face-time with the Maniac, you know, for the blog.

GUS:
689 hits and climbing.

JULIET:
Nothing I can't handle. I was just about to give 'em an interview. It was only gonna be two words. (holds up two fingers resembling an obscene gesture)

SHAWN:
Oh! (makes a cross with his fingers)

FOX:
Okay, come on.

FOX and WILDE leave.

SHAWN:
I'll see you tonight. Bring the outfit. One of us might wear it.

JULIET:
Get lost!

SHAWN watches her skate away.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

As VICK walks by, she sees JULIET at her desk, still in her derby uniform.

VICK:
O'Hara. Might I have a word? In my office.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK goes behind her desk and starts going through a file. JULIET rolls in on her skates.

JULIET:
Oh, sorry, Chief. I have to break these things in, and you know how my family is cursed with bad arches, right?

VICK:
Please take them off.

JULIET:
I was just gonna suggest that. (sits down)

VICK:
Later.

JULIET looks at her surprised.

VICK:
Did you break somebody's nose?

JULIET:
(giggles) Yes, I did. Thank you.

VICK looks up from the file.

JULIET:
Oh, but it was a clean hit. It was actually more of a dislocation. You know, it just popped right back in. Yeah. She curled into my wingspan, so I was totally justified. We're friends now. She has a cat.

VICK:
(walks over to her) I'm concerned for your safety and that this might be a mistake.

JULIET:
No, no, no. It is not a mistake. It's actually a very smart call. I have found a scad of priors on my suspects. Aggravated assault, battery. Oh! And reckless endangerment.

VICK:
So, you're saying putting you in danger is a bonus?

JULIET:
I'm telling you I can handle myself.

VICK:
(sits across from her) I didn't want to do this in the first place. And I'll be candid, O'Hara. You tend to dive in a little too deeply when you go undercover.

JULIET:
Look, Chief, first off, roller derby is better than therapy. If I were into that sort of thing. And secondly, these girls, they're not making any money. Most of them are paying out of pocket and they are all the right element for this kind of behavior.

VICK:
Hunches and profiles are not gonna keep this thing going. I need concrete proof. Soon. I want every single one of those suspects from that security video. (stands and walks back to desk)

JULIET:
Done. (stands and starts for door)

VICK:
Oh, um. this a typo, right? $800 for skates?

JULIET:
(stops) Would it help if I told you the other pairs weren't cute at all?

VICK:
Get me results. Hurry.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is at her desk untying her skates when her phone rings.

JULIET:
Yeah, this is Maniac. Oh, yeah! Tonight? Yeah, I can keep it quiet. Okay. I'll be there.

INT. PSYCH, NIGHT

JULIET enters dressed for undercover.

JULIET:
(sighs) I'm sorry I'm late.

SHAWN has the table prepared for a candlelit dinner.

JULIET:
(whispers) Oh, my God. Is there somebody here? Are you on a date?

SHAWN:
(laughs nervously) No, no, no, no, no, no. I just, uh...I didn't know if you'd be hungry, so I just...I threw something together quickly.

JULIET:
Uh, we gotta get right to this. I was just at the station and I really think I am on to something.

SHAWN:
That's great. We have all night to talk about it. (holds up wine) Gewurztraminer?

JULIET:
Yes. No, no, no, no. I can't stay. I got a call from one of the girls. Are those crab cakes?

SHAWN:
Yes, they are. With dill and coriander. (picks one up with tongs) Which girl are we talking about?

JULIET:
They call her Toxic Waste, but her name is Shelly. Said she was talking to some of the other girls and that they were very impressed by me and I am perfect for something they have going on downtown tonight. A "money-making opportunity".

SHAWN remembers the cruise ticket he found in SHELLY'S locker.

SHAWN:
(places crab cake on plates) Jules, don't go.

JULIET:
Shawn, I ran some of their names. They have records.

SHAWN:
I've already eliminated Toxic Waste. She wasn't at the break-in. (sits at table)

JULIET:
I don't think you understand. I am undercover right now, and things can get real sticky, real fast.

SHAWN:
Sticky how?

JULIET:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
Jules, listen. This thing that's happening tonight, it's not what you think it is. Now, sit down. Have some endives.

JULIET:
Shawn, are we working together or not?

SHAWN:
Yes, technically, we're working together on this case. But you know what, Jules? I'm not feeling particularly together right now.

JULIET:
Then support me. Because I really think I am on to something. Now, I gotta go, and you're either in or you're out.

After staring at SHAWN for a moment, JULIET grabs a crab cake and leaves. SHAWN stands and blows out the candles.

EXT. WAREHOUSE, NIGHT

JULIET is directing some officers. LASSITER is in conversation with other officers. SHAWN is leaning on a car.

JULIET:
North exit, south exit. Nobody gets out.

OFFICER:
Yes, ma'am.

OFFICER 2:
Mmm-hmm.

The two officers go to do as JULIET ordered. SHAWN comes over to her.

SHAWN:
Jules. You do realize we're outside of a warehouse?

JULIET:
That's not the point, Shawn. Even if it's not a burglary, it's very likely some kind of peripheral criminal activity.

SHAWN:
This place isn't like any of the others.

JULIET:
Look, I am really sorry I have to do this to you, but... Carlton?

LASSITER:
I'll be right back. (leaves officers)

SHAWN:
Jules!

LASSITER:
Spencer, you're in the way. Go.

SHAWN goes to stand by the car as JULIET heads for the doors.

LASSITER:
All right. We're gonna let her get in here and on her signal, we're gonna light this candle.

LASSITER and the officers aim their guns at the door. JULIET looks back at them and nods before sliding the door open. We see reflected colored lights and hear dance music.

DIRECTOR: (v.o.)
Cut! Brilliant! Beautiful!

JULIET:
(whispers) Stand down.

DIRECTOR: (v.o.)
Do it again! Reset the playback, please.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

VICK strides into her office and behind her desk to confront SHAWN, LASSITER and JULIET.

VICK:
A music video shoot? I sent nearly a dozen uniformed officers and six black-and-whites, and none of your suspects were even there. Now, I'm gonna need a pretty damn compelling reason not to pull the plug on this one, O'Hara, because right now, we've got nothing.

SHAWN:
(raises hand) It was me. I felt a vibe. I got a message.

VICK:
You did?

SHAWN:
Yes. Turns out it was a major metaphysical snafu. O'Hara said it was a non-start, I threw a tantrum. I was crying, kicking, and stamping my little feet. I mean, they're not abnormally small.

VICK:
O'Hara?

LASSITER:
Look, Chief, I can get results. Let me in on this.

SHAWN:
Sure, Chief. Lassie seems like a smart choice. We know he's a demon on wheels, and he's so very good with women.

VICK:
Under the circumstances, I might consider you, Carlton, but you're never more obvious than when you're undercover. Perhaps you've forgotten the prosthetic nose debacle of 2005?

SHAWN chuckles but stops when he sees a list of the stolen property on VICK'S desk.

JULIET:
Chief, we are definitely onto something. Last night's robbery fits the pattern we've seen between criminal activity and specific teams. We've narrowed it down to a few suspects.

SHAWN:
Three suspects. Teammates, friends, pen pals. Solid suspects. Maybe four. Possibly five. Ah, six could...

VICK:
Now, Mr. Spencer. The idea is to have fewer suspects. You don't get paid by the suspect.

SHAWN:
I see us closing this by tomorrow.

VICK:
Tomorrow then.

JULIET:
Absolutely.

VICK:
Fine, but I'm gonna need results without another incident, metaphysical or otherwise. You're all dismissed.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN, JULIET and LASSITER leave VICK'S office. LASSITER goes in the opposite direction.

SHAWN:
Wow. She really unloaded on us.

JULIET:
Thank you for taking the heat on that one, Shawn.

GUS gets up from the bench where he was studying and falls in beside them.

SHAWN:
Jules, that's how it goes when you're partners. If I could count the number of times that Gus has left my cheese in the wind.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Nothing. Study on, buddy. Arteriosclerosis, rosacea, croup.

JULIET:
Croup?

SHAWN:
You'll have to owe me one. Or... you can give me one of these bracelets. (reveals friendship bracelet on her wrist) They come in teal?

JULIET:
Can't do.

SHAWN:
Can't do teal?

JULIET:
No. Westwood gave it to me. It's a roller derby thing. Think of something else.

SHAWN:
Fine. You can dial back the Maniac routine. Stop pulling rank on me.

JULIET:
Okay.

SHAWN:
Ordering me around.

JULIET:
Fine.

SHAWN:
And smoothies are on you until we nab someone.

JULIET:
I want to figure out the next step by seeing how you work. I want to get close to your process, get some hard evidence.

SHAWN opens his mouth to answer, but GUS speaks first.

GUS:
Yeah, Shawn. That's a good idea. Why don't you bring her right in on your process?

SHAWN:
Jules, here's the thing. Close is good. Very close is even better. But not for this. My process is not a tandem bike. It's a unicycle. Now, you belong at practice. I can see Fox. You gotta keep an eye on her.

JULIET:
That's gonna be really difficult. She's always surrounded by Westwood and Wilde.

SHAWN:
Perfect. Keep an eye on them too.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN is writing on the Plexi-glass board. He backs away when done.

SHAWN:
There. The lists from Vick's desk. And they make absolutely no sense whatsoever.

GUS is sitting at the table from last night, studying.

GUS:
Why don't you arrange them in alphabetical order?

SHAWN:
That's not the point, Gus. They stole a DVD of Spanglish. Clearly, they weren't after the merchandise.

GUS:
That's not exactly hard evidence, Shawn.

SHAWN:
Thank you, Professor No Help.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I'm sorry. Did you miss that? Maybe I should've said "MC No Help" or "Doctor Do-Nothing" because you're bringing nothing to the table.

GUS:
I have a test, remember? No pass, no job. No job, no driving you around. Besides, you're doing perfectly fine with your new partner.

SHAWN:
Who? Jules?

GUS:
"Who? Jules?" What? Who do you think?

SHAWN:
Don't be jealous.

GUS:
I'm not jealous.

SHAWN:
Don't be vexed. You're still number one on my MySpace page. Jules and I are just working a case together. Nothing more.

GUS lifts his book and SHAWN sees the green slime is still there. He recalls first seeing it at the crime scene and then remembers a bottle of skate oil in the lockers.

SHAWN:
Wilde was there.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Cynthia "Speed Freak" Wilde was there at Zilk's during the break-in. She uses this green oil to lubricate her skates. Looks like she left some behind. Good clue, buddy.

SHAWN knocks on the table then goes to his desk and picks up his phone.

GUS:
You have Fox with the broken watch and now Wilde. Why don't you call the cops?

SHAWN:
According to the tapes, there were at least three more. If we don't get them, they're gonna doing their thing. That is the oath of thieves, Gus. That is the code of the roller girl.

GUS:
I never thought I would hear you say that.

SHAWN:
Even more than "sinkhole sissy feet flapjack go-go boots"? Juliet isn't answering her phone.

GUS just looks at him and eats some crabcake.

GUS:
Mmmm.

SHAWN:
You know, those crab cakes are, like, three days old or something.

GUS looks up, surprised.

INT. ARENA, ROLLER DERBY TRACK, NIGHT

The others are giving JULIET pointers and tips.

FOX:
Okay, remember, Maniac, the key is to just get through the pack. Whatever it takes.

JULIET:
Well, we don't want to injure anyone in practice, do we?

WILDE:
Of course not, but if someone's shoulder has to get dislocated, well, make sure it isn't yours. Back to it, boss?

JULIET:
Wait, where is Lethal Weapon?

FOX:
Oh, Westwood? She had to split a second ago. Go visit her mother. Let's go kick some ass.

JULIET:
Cool. I'm just gonna grab something.

FOX:
Okay, see you on the track.

INT. ARENA, LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT

JULIET enters and finds WESTWOOD packing a bag.

JULIET:
Westwood, hey!

WESTWOOD:
Hey.

JULIET:
You leaving?

WESTWOOD:
Yeah.

JULIET:
Everything okay?

WESTWOOD:
I have to go meet my boyfriend. (closes locker) He's kinda got car trouble, so...

JULIET:
Oh!

WESTWOOD:
I have to go.

JULIET:
Oh!

WESTWOOD:
Yeah, well, uh, he's kind of stranded out on the Mesa somewhere.

JULIET:
Okay, all right, well, make sure you bring him to the bout tomorrow.

WESTWOOD:
Yeah, I'll try. Yeah. (leaves)

JULIET:
See ya later.

JULIET looks up at the ceiling and notices a loose tile. She moves a garbage can underneath and climbs up. She moves the tile and finds a couple of hand scanners. She lifts some prints.

INT. ECHO, NIGHT

SHAWN is driving when his phone rings.

SHAWN:
Jules.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. ARENA, LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT

JULIET:
Shawn, I found a couple of hand-held scanning machines here at the hall. You feel anything on scanning machines? (checks WESTWOOD'S locker)

SHAWN:
Scanning machines?

JULIET:
Yeah, for making copies.

SHAWN:
Ah, no, no. Copying devices are notoriously unreliable psychic fetters. Now, if they were three-hole punchers, different story.

JULIET:
Okay, well, I'm gonna look around some more, but I wanted to let you know Westwood left practice early today. She gave me some lie and then she just took off.

SHAWN and GUS pull up to the arena and witness WESTWOOD leaving.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm getting something now. Street clothes, green tank top, jeans, belt... Terrible, terrible belt.

JULIET:
Do you see her?

SHAWN:
En mi cabesa, Jules. I got a psychic track on her now.

The game bell goes off in the arena.

JULIET:
Okay, I gotta go. Call Lassiter if you find anything out.

SHAWN:
Of course, I'll call Lassiter. (closes phone) I'm not calling Lassiter.

GUS scoffs. They watch WESTWOOD get into her car.

SHAWN:
Follow the bouncing Westwood.

WESTWOOD pulls out and they follow.

EXT. STREET, NIGHT

GUS:
Not too close, she's gonna see us!

INT. ECHO, NIGHT

They continue to follow.

GUS:
(peers into back window) Dude... is that...

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
I think there's a body in the back of that truck.

SHAWN:
(laughs) Gus, it's not a body.

GUS:
It is! That's a hand.

SHAWN:
Dude, this test has got you all jacked up. You're not thinking straight. You're distracted trying to remember the difference between Lermacil and Hermacil.

GUS:
Lermacil is for fever blisters, Hermacil is for eczema.

SHAWN:
And what about Chermacil?

GUS:
No such thing as Chermacil, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(turns to GUS) Studying? (looks back) Sweet Fantasy Island, that is a body!

GUS:
I told you. Not too close.

SHAWN:
Gus, Westwood is ditching a body. That's the break in the case we need.

GUS:
We need is to call Lassiter like Juliet said. And back off a little, she's gonna see us.

SHAWN:
We're not calling him. You know how this works. I really have to explain it to you every single time?

WESTWOOD turns but SHAWN doesn't see because he's looking at GUS.

GUS:
You just lost Westwood.

SHAWN:
Damn it!

Later they track WESTWOOD to the marina and watch as she dumps the contents from the back of her car.

SHAWN:
Bingo.

After she leaves, SHAWN opens his door.

SHAWN:
Let's go.

GUS:
I'm not going out there.

SHAWN:
(closes door) Dude, it's only gonna take a second. You cannot sit here alone in the dark in a parked car. You'll get picked up for Mopery.

GUS:
Mopery?

SHAWN:
With intent to creep. Trust me, it'll kick a big hole in your future.

They exit the car.

EXT. MARINA, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS walk down the dock, eyes searching the water. They sigh and shrug.

SHAWN:
I guess it wasn't a body.

A woman's body floats to the surface. GUS gags and runs away. SHAWN peers at it. He then looks around, realizing GUS is gone.

SHAWN:
Gus?

EXT. MARINA, DAY

SHAWN and GUS follow LASSITER along the beach to where VICK is waiting under a pier. The "body" they spotted washed up and is a mannequin.

LASSITER:
(chuckles) Well done, Spencer. (crouches) I don't know, Chief. You want me to try and get her statement? Of course, I don't speak mannequin. (grins)

SHAWN and GUS point at him.

VICK:
Cute. You might want to hold off on that because we still have all the merchandise from the Zilk's burglaries. Excellent work, Mr. Spencer.

Officers are carrying merchandise from the water.

SHAWN:
Thanks, Chief. (walks over to LASSITER) It's all right. I accept your apology.

VICK:
So the burglars weren't after the merchandise.

SHAWN:
(picks up mannequin arm) That's right.

VICK:
So what were they after?

SHAWN:
(counts mannequin's fingers) One, two, three, four, five. Five, four. Four, five.

VICK:
What?

SHAWN:
I'm seeing four and I'm seeing five. Lassie, four and five!

LASSITER:
Nine? The number nine?

SHAWN:
No, four times five.

VICK:
20?

SHAWN:
5 and 20. 5 times 20.

VICK:
100.

SHAWN:
Minus 4 times 4 times 5.

LASSITER:
4 times 4 times 5?

GUS:
80.

VICK:
No, 20. 100 minus 80 is 20. We all have our math facts straight, Mr. Spencer. Is this going somewhere?

SHAWN:
(holds mannequin's hand to his head) Skater number 20. She's the one who dumped all this stuff.

GUS:
That's Rita "Lethal Weapon" Westwood.

LASSITER:
Great, we got one. We need all of 'em.

SHAWN:
Correct. This is bigger than Westwood. A lot bigger. Juliet's close.

VICK:
Okay. Lassiter, let's get someone on the lookout for any more dumping sites around town.

VICK walks away. SHAWN rubs the mannequin's hand along LASSITER'S arm. The detective just glares at him before leaving. SHAWN drops the arm and hurries in the opposite direction. GUS falls in step.

SHAWN:
We've got to get to Zilk's, and check something out.

GUS:
If you say "pants," I'm gonna sock you in your Adam's apple.

SHAWN:
Sock you in your crotch, damn it.

WILDE has been watching and is on the phone.

WILDE:
Hey, it's me. Listen, we got a situation.

FOX: (over phone)
What is it?

WILDE:
Westwood screwed up again huge.  The cops found everything. If they get to her, she's gonna talk.

FOX: (over phone)
This is bad.

WILDE:
Yeah, and it gets worse. Maniac's fan boy's also here.

FOX: (over phone)
Doing what?

WILDE:
He's working with the cops.

FOX: (over phone)
Are we compromised?

WILDE:
I don't know, but after we handle Westwood, I think we need to have a talk with Maniac.

INT. ZILK'S STORE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are walking through the store.

GUS:
What are we doing here, Shawn? We already know it wasn't the merchandise.

SHAWN:
But it was something else. (stops and looks at something before smiling) Let's go.

They walk over to a mannequin that is wearing GUS' exact outfit.

SHAWN:
Dude, I can't believe this. You lifted your look right off this mannequin.

GUS:
On the contrary, Shawn. Clearly, someone is stealing my look. (looks at mannequin sideways)

SHAWN:
Right. I did see Tommy Hilfiger creeping from bush to bush, sketching you.

SHAWN sees the green streaks on the floor leading to a door marked Employees Only.

SHAWN:
And we're moving. But your friend can't come.

They walk over to the door.

SHAWN:
The thieves were after something in this room.

GUS:
Dude, we can't go inside there. Read the sign.

SHAWN:
(reads photo next to door) "Laura Noid. Employee of the Month." You know her?

GUS:
Not that one. "Employees only."

SHAWN:
Gotcha. Be my lookout.

They walk closer to the door and SHAWN reaches for the knob with one hand.

GUS:
No problem. I'll just keep it safe from the outside.

SHAWN opens the door and pushes GUS into the room first.

INT. ZILK'S STORE, OFFICE

A young WOMAN is working in the office and screams when she sees them.

SHAWN:
It's okay. It's all right. My name is Shawn Spencer. This is my partner... (opens his mouth for a name and nothing comes out) I can't believe I'm blanking. I've done this a million times.

GUS:
Nice work.

WOMAN:
(calls security) Office, code blue.

SHAWN:
It's okay. We're not here to rob you.

WOMAN:
Your buddy stole the clothes right off the mannequin.

GUS:
These are my clothes.

WOMAN:
Look, we don't keep the cash back here. This is the credit department.

GUS:
We just want to talk to you about the burglary.

WOMAN:
Oh, do you, Mannequin Man? Well, why don't you tell that to my little can of pepper spray? (grabs can and threatens them)

GUS:
Whoa, whoa!

SHAWN:
Hey, chill, chill, chill!

At that moment, COBURN enters with his baton raised.

SHAWN:
Stuart.

COBURN:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
(points at the WOMAN) Tell her!

COBURN:
(lowers baton) It's all right. These guys are with the police. Why is your friend dressed like the mannequin?

GUS:
That mannequin is dressed like me! Thank you. Can we go, Shawn?

SHAWN:
Hold up. What were you doing over there?

WOMAN:
Oh, uh, it's Friday. I was shredding credit card applications. It's the only fun thing I get to do.

SHAWN reads one pf the applications on the desk and sees it asks for a Social Security Number.

SHAWN:
Burglary happened on a Thursday.

GUS:
The day before they shred the credit applications.

SHAWN:
Thanks, guys. It was good to see you, Stu.

SHAWN pats COBURN on the back as he and GUS leave the office.

INT. ZILK'S STORE, DAY

Just outside the office, SHAWN calls JULIET.

SHAWN:
Jules, I'm getting some strong messages.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. ARENA, TRACK, NIGHT

JULIET is walking up to the track area.

JULIET:
Okay, what are they?

SHAWN:
First one's from Keanu Reeves. He's living in a house I built on a lake two years in the past. How will I meet him? The second is that the thieves were not after the merchandise.

JULIET:
Well, we already know that, Shawn.

SHAWN:
They were using the hand scanners to steal information off credit card applications. They're stealing identities.

JULIET:
Oh. So then ransacking the store and stealing the merchandise was just to throw us off the trail?

SHAWN:
Right-o. A handful of fake credit cards is worth more than everything in that entire store times ten. It's a pretty brilliant plan. Only slightly less brilliant than that YouTube video of the monkey bathing the cat.

WILDE and FOX skate up in front of JULIET.

WILDE:
Hey, Maniac!

FOX:
We need you to come with us, Maniac.

WILDE:
Right now.

WILDE puts her arm around JULIET'S shoulders and she goes with them.

SHAWN:
Jules, who is that? Who's talking?

The phone clicks off.

SHAWN:
We gotta go.

EXT. ARENA, NIGHT

GUS pulls into the parking lot. They get out of the car and walk to the entrance.

GUS:
So we have three suspects.

SHAWN:
Two to go.

GUS:
And you think they're on to Juliet?

SHAWN:
I said they might be. Either way, we're gonna find out pretty quick.

GUS:
What do you think they'll do to her?

They stop when they see JULIET'S friendship bracelet on the ground. They look at each other and then the building.

SHAWN:
They may've done it already. (sees WESTWOOD'S truck) That's Westwood's truck.

They walk over to the truck and peer into the back window.

GUS:
I can't see anything.

SHAWN:
Look for something to jimmy the lock.

GUS turns the latch and the window opens. SHAWN walks back and GUS lowers the tailgate to reveal a moving blanket covering something. SHAWN put his hands on his head, anquished.

SHAWN:
Oh!

GUS flips back the blanket to reveal a dead WESTWOOD.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Thank God.

GUS:
Thank God? It's a dead person.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but it's not Juliet.

GUS:
It's still a human being, Shawn. It's Westwood. What's the matter with you? (covers the body)

SHAWN:
You're saying you'd rather it be someone that we know and care about?

GUS closes the back of the car.

SHAWN:
Fine, next time I see Jules, I'll just tell her you wish she was dead. (walks off)

GUS:
(follows) I never said that I wished Juliet was dead.

INT. ARENA, ROLLER DERBY TRACK, NIGHT

There is a match going on.

ANNOUNCER:
Lead jammer Mrs. Bash is trapped in the pack! Speed Freak trying to slash through Pismo's vulnerable inside line. The Trollops are gonna have to do a 180 in the second half tonight.

SHAWN and GUS push through the audience so their on the edge of the track.

SHAWN:
(spots JULIET) Maniac!

JULIET waves him off as she passes.

ANNOUNCER:
Unless Hayseed Wannabe and Off-White Trash have their way, it might just happen. It's down to the wire, friends.

FOX and WILDE are planning something. FOX reaches down to her leg, pulls out a tag and sticks it on JULIET'S back. FOX then whispers to some of the other players.

SHAWN:
Oh, my God. The roller girls are onto Juliet.

GUS:
Which ones?

SHAWN:
The bad ones. And I know who they are. They're marking their own teammate. They want to hurt her or worse.

JULIET is starting to realize her teammates are up to something.

GUS:
We gotta do something. (steals a pair of skates from audience member)

ANNOUNCER:
Things are heating up out here, people. I hope you've brought protection.

The skaters start preparing to get JULIET. GUS comes back wearing the skates and a helmet. He's a little unsteady.

SHAWN:
Gus! (hurries over) What are you doing?

GUS:
You've been complaining about me not being any help here, and that's about to change. They're gonna try to make a run for it, but not before they take Juliet down.

SHAWN:
Yes, yes. But this is a terrible idea.

GUS:
I can skate, Shawn. I got this. (skates onto the track)

SHAWN:
What are you...

ANNOUNCER:
Now it looks like we got a guest on the track?

GUS skates against traffic.

JULIET:
Hey!

ANNOUNCER:
You're taking your life in your hands, pal.

FOX and WILDE make their move. GUS blocks WILDE and she falls.

ANNOUNCER:
And oh, Speed Freak goes down! There's something you don't see every day.

GUS turns around and smiles at SHAWN who gives him a thumbs-up. GUS turns back to be met with a wall of angry skaters, two of whom knock him to the floor.

SHAWN:
Oh, man!

SHAWN runs out onto the track and helps GUS up. He then pushes him after the other skaters. FOX rounds the corner and heads for SHAWN. He stands in the middle of the track and waves his fingers in a "come and get me" motion. JULIET sees what happening and reaches SHAWN just in time, putting her arm out in time to knock FOX down. LASSITER and VICK arrive in the background.

JULIET:
Shawn, watch out!

SHAWN tries to get out of the way but causes a massive pileup on the track. JULIET makes her way back to SHAWN and puts her hands on her hips. SHAWN mouths "Thank you". She mouths "You're welcome". The skaters get back up and resume the race.

WOMAN:
Come on! Let's go!

EXT. ARENA, NIGHT

SHAWN, GUS and JULIET are waiting outside when VICK joins them.

VICK:
Four suspects?

JULIET:
It was identity theft, Chief. They were only after the information off the credit card applications the customers fill out. All of the stores they hit had similar credit card programs.

SHAWN:
They break in, wreak havoc, and split before the clock runs out.

GUS:
Just the kind of anarchy their fans pay for night after night.

JULIET:
I got prints off a key piece of evidence I found here.

SHAWN:
She got 'em when she wasn't busy kicking ass! Huh? Can I hear something for Maniac? She really brought it, huh? Am I right? Who's with me?

LASSITER is bringing out FOX and WILDE.

VICK:
Lassiter, take them away.

SHAWN:
(holds hands to his head) Whoa, whoa, wait. I'm seeing the fifth suspect.

LASSITER:
She get away?

SHAWN:
No. Rita "Lethal Weapon" Westwood. Unfortunately, you'll find her body in her pickup truck in the parking lot. She's the one that botched the merchandise drop. She paid dearly for it.

VICK:
Anything else?

SHAWN:
Um, not really. Did I mention Juliet's roller derby awesomeness? Huh? Maniac, Maniac, Maniac. I can't get anything from these people.

GUS:
They're murderers, Shawn. They're going away for life. I gotta study. (walks away)

VICK:
Lassiter, take them away.

LASSITER:
Ladies. (takes them away)

VICK:
You two work together well.

SHAWN:
I certainly think so. We're available for more cases, by the way. Embezzlement, extortion, espionage. Pretty much anything that starts with "e." Elephant theft.

VICK:
I'll take that under advisement.

VICK looks at JULIET with a small smile before walking away.

JULIET:
Elephant theft?

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah.

JULIET:
People steal elephants?

SHAWN:
Major problem. Pretty much out of control.

INT. ARENA, ROLLER DERBY TRACK, DAY

JULIET is in regular clothes and carrying her skates. SHAWN sits up in one of the chairs as she approaches.

SHAWN:
Oh, hey, Jules! What are you doing here?

JULIET:
I'm returning my equipment. What are you doing here?

SHAWN:
Just hangin'. You know, chillin'. I was actually feeling a little nostalgic. Remember when we cracked that case here and the criminals turned out to be roller derby girls? (chuckles)

JULIET:
Yeah, I remember that.

SHAWN:
Gosh, seems like it was just yesterday. (stands and is wearing skates)

JULIET:
Probably because it was yesterday. Why are you wearing skates?

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah, look at that. I guess I am. I don't know. Uh, I guess I just thought it was a shame. We have this big, beautiful track and no one to skate on it. It's also been a while since I've had a good blister.

JULIET:
Mmm.

SHAWN holds up the index finger on his right hand and twirls it.

DJ:
This will be a couples' skate. Couples only.

"Space Age Love Song" by A Flock of Seagulls plays. SHAWN looks at JULIET with a little head tilt.

SHAWN:
Come on!

JULIET:
Shawn!

Moments later the DJ turns on the spotlight and follows them around the track. SHAWN is having a little difficult time. JULIET puts a hand on his arm to steady him.

JULIET:
Did you do that on purpose?

SHAWN:
No. Maybe. Okay, yes. Yes, I did.

They skate side-by-side and SHAWN tries to take her hand.

JULIET:
(pulls hand away) No hands.

She puts her hand back down and they continue to skate, the backs of their hands touching.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

GUS is sitting at his desk, his laptop open, as he tries to sign in for his exam.

GUS:
Damn!

SHAWN:
(at his desk) What is it?

GUS:
It won't let me log in. And I have to take my exam by today!

SHAWN:
Really? (closes laptop) That's probably because I just took it for you.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I can't believe you're still using "chocolate thunder" as your password.

GUS:
You took my exam?

SHAWN:
Little harder than the river raft test, way easier than the Secret Service test. Any of the questions I didn't know I just answered "c". Right?

GUS leans back in his chair, hands on head, a look of panic on his face.

GUS:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

SHAWN:
Dude, it's done. Relax. And you know what? Nailed it! Well, almost nailed it. At the very least, definitely didn't blow it.

GUS:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
I don't think...

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Hey, you're in, okay? Sadly, you're still a pharmaceutical rep. But hey, whatever.

GUS:
I studied for this test all week for nothing.

SHAWN:
Yes, you did. But that's the sort of thing that builds character.

GUS jumps up from his chair. SHAWN does the same and runs away through the outer office.

SHAWN:
Knowledge is power! Don't you want to feel powerful?

He runs back through the main office and GUS rounds on him.

GUS:
Shawn.

GUS chases SHAWN through the office and SHAWN screams.

Episode 3x08 Gus Walks Into a Bank

INT. ECHO, DAY

The Echo is parked in the street outside a bank. SHAWN reclines his seat with a sigh. GUS looks at him in disbelief.

GUS:
You're not coming in? You're going to make me stand in that deposit line all by myself?

SHAWN:
No, buddy, I will be with you in spirit, like a tiny wood nymph. Besides, what's your glitch with the ATM machine, anyway?

GUS:
(prepares deposit) It's a "people thing", Shawn. Business should always be done face-to-face.

SHAWN:
Well, if you remember, I'm holding a bit of a grudge against this particular banking institution.

GUS:
Why? Because they turned you down for a small business loan last year?

SHAWN:
Yes, because they turned me down for a small business loan. That was completely legitimate, Gus.

GUS:
Shawn, it was for a zip line pulley system to transport snacks from the kitchen to your desk.

SHAWN:
Or the reception area. What's your point?

GUS:
Part of running a business together, Shawn, is sharing in the responsibilities of the "business" side of the business, like making deposits.

SHAWN:
What about the "bidnizz" side? 'Cause I feel like I'm more of a "bidnizz" man. Who's covering that?

GUS:
(unclips seatbelt) You know what? Fine. I'll do it myself. (leaves)

SHAWN turns on the radio and puts his feet on the dashboard.

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

GUS fills out a deposit slip at the podium in the center of the room. Customers being taken care of by cashiers with others waiting in line. A MAN walks into the bank and is escorted to one of the offices. GUS gets in line and, when he sees a pretty cashier, straightens his collar and tries to appear cool. The MAN is lead back into the lobby, a gun hanging partway out of his jacket pocket.

WOMAN:
(screams and points) Ah! He's got a gun!

The customers duck and try to run. The cashier that GUS was eyeing hits a silent alarm. The MAN turns in a circle before taking out the gun.

ROBBER:
Don't anybody move! (to MANAGER) You, go! Now, don't anybody move!

An older security GUARD confronts him with a gun.

GUARD:
Drop the gun!

ROBBER:
You drop your gun!

The GUARD drops his gun the ROBBER accidentally fires his. He puts a hand to his head, nervous and scared. The people in the bank are even more scared.

ROBBER:
(to GUARD) Get over there! Get back! Don't anybody do anything!

GUS, sitting on the floor, presses himself into the counter.

INT. ECHO, DAY

SHAWN sits up and looks towards the bank. He then hears sirens. LASSITER and JULIET pull up right in front of the Echo. He gets out of the car.

EXT. BANK, DAY

A number of patrol cars pull up as LASSITER and JULIET get out of the car.

SHAWN:
Lassie, Jules... what are you doing here?

LASSITER:
What are you doing here?

JULIET:
Shawn, we have a situation. Some guy held up the bank and we think he's taken hostages.

SHAWN rushes to the bank but LASSITER grabs him.

LASSITER:
Whoa! Whoa, take it easy.

SHAWN:
(takes deep breath) Gus is in there.

INT. HENRY'S, KITCHEN

HENRY turns on the TV while he has coffee. The news is covering the situation at the bank.

SUE ELLEN:
This is Sue Ellen Jasper reporting to you live outside the Santa Barbara National Savings Bank where an as-yet-unnamed assailant has attempted to steal over a million dollars' worth of diamonds and is now holding hostages inside.

EXT. BANK, DAY

SUE ELLEN continues her report.

SUE ELLEN:
Police are on the scene but have yet to reveal any further details. We'll report back to you as soon as we have more information.

SHAWN and JULIET are standing behind a police van where they are watching surveillance from inside the bank.

JULIET:
You didn't see anything?

SHAWN:
I wasn't in the bank, Jules. Whoa! Hold it right there.

SHAWN watches the replay of the ROBBER entering the bank and being greeted by the MANAGER.

JULIET:
Why didn't you go into the bank?

SHAWN:
We came here to make a deposit. That's not really a two-man job. What, we both should've grabbed a corner of the check and gingerly walked it in together?

SHAWN looks at video from the vault and sees the MANAGER raise his hands before the ROBBER pulls his gun.

JULIET:
I just find it oddly un-psychic of you to have not known this was going to happen.

SHAWN:
(frustrated) I don't see into the future, Jules. I read things in the present. And I get it. You think I'm not kicking myself enough? I let my best friend go in there without me and now he's stuck in there and I'm stuck out here. (walks off)

LASSITER is standing behind his car looking into the bank with binoculars. BUZZ is with him. SHAWN and JULIET walk over.

SHAWN:
Detective Lassiter, that guy could be a loose cannon. Someone needs to go inside the bank.

VICK:
(joins them) O'Hara, I need you to take statements from the remaining witnesses that were outside the bank.

JULIET:
Got it, Chief. (leaves)

VICK:
Now, Detective...

LASSITER:
Yeah.

VICK:
I just wanted you to know that I've informed the FBI and SWAT and their chief negotiator is moments away.

SHAWN is a bundle of nervous energy and keeps looking at the bank.

LASSITER:
No.

VICK:
It's protocol and you know it.

LASSITER:
Chief, this thing's already turning into a three-ring circus without bringing those adrenaline monkeys down here.

VICK:
Look, we have a hostage situation, Detective, and I expect you to fully cooperate.

LASSITER:
Just make a call in the bank. See where we're at. Maybe I can wrap this thing up here and now. Save the city a whole lot of time and money.

SHAWN:
Somebody needs to call into the bank!

LASSITER holds up his phone just as sirens are heard as SWAT arrives in two SUVs and a van. Men in tactical gear jump out and automatically take up position. The ROBBER cautiously peers out the front door of the bank. The back of the van opens to reveal an older man in a bulletproof vest over a dress shirt. He jumps down and runs a hand through his hair. SHAWN doesn't know what to make of him. The man puts on sunglasses and walks over to them as more officers exit the van.

MAN:
Heads up, we're on the clock!

SHAWN:
And cut! Great. Dripping with swagger. Let's go again, though, and maybe ease up on the cocksure smile just a bit. I liked it. I'm just not sure it's going to play in the Midwest.

MAN:
Who the hell are you?

SHAWN:
Oh, my apologies. I'm Shawn Spencer. Lead psychic for the SBPD. And dilettante of shadow puppetry. (holds hands up) What's this? What's this right here? (makes kissing sound) Oh, that's a swan kissing the moon.

MAN:
Well, I'm Commander Luntz, hostage negotiator, and I will thank you to step aside and let me handle things from here.

LASSITER:
(clears throat) Luntz.

LUNTZ:
(sighs) Lassiter.

LASSITER:
Perhaps as head detective I can brief you on what's going on here.

LUNTZ:
Listen, Detective, I don't want to play the title game with you.

SHAWN:
(legs twitch with pent up energy) Title game? Is that anything like Celebrity? 'Cause if it is, I'm going to kick your ass.

Nobody responds.

SHAWN:
What? I will. I'm really good at the game.

LUNTZ:
Little refresher, I have 26 years of experience and I'm sort of an expert in human psychology and conditioning so I do know two things. One, your friend here is acting out of a place of fear. A little sweat on the temple, a little vibrato in the voice. This is personal for you. And number two, I have about 40 seconds to initiate a call into that bank before all the wheels spin off of this thing. So, excuse me. (calls to he men) Boys, fire me up a call inside the bank and patch me in. (walks away)

MAN:
Yes, sir. Right away.

SHAWN:
We're not just going to let him do this, right, Lassie?

LASSITER:
It's protocol. We have no choice.

With a sigh, SHAWN backs away and dials his phone.

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

The hostages in the bank are sitting on the floor as the ROBBER paces. GUS' phone starts to ring and he ignores it.

ROBBER:
Whose phone is that?

MAN:
(points at GUS) It's his phone.

GUS:
Thank you, sir. We're hostages together. We're supposed to be on the same side here.

ROBBER:
(walks over to GUS) Give me the phone.

GUS:
I apologize. I would, but it's my work phone. (takes phone from jacket pocket) And I get charged the deductible for any lost or stolen items, so how about I just turn the ringer off?

The ROBBER takes the phone from GUS and throws it to the floor where it breaks apart. GUS gasps.

ROBBER:
Everyone, cell phones, now!

The hostages pull out their phones and throw them on the floor by GUS'. The phone on one of the desks begins to ring. The ROBBER walks over slowly and picks it up.

EXT. BANK, DAY

LUNTZ walks around the cordoned area as he talks.

LUNTZ:
This is Commander Luntz. My friends call me Luntz. You are? That's good. That's fine. You don't have to say anything. I can do all the talking for now. I'm real good at these one-sided conversations, just ask my ex-wife. What about you? You married?

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

As LUNTZ talks, the ROBBER looks out the window and sees the SWAT men moving as they change position.

ROBBER:
Get those guys away from the bank! Tell them to get the hell back!

LUNTZ: (over phone)
I can do that.

ROBBER:
Do it now!

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

EXT. BANK, DAY

LUNTZ:
Well, you got to do something for me then. That's how these things work.

ROBBER:
What?

LUNTZ:
How 'bout we start with a name? You give me your name and I will back those guys so far up they'll have to put two stamps on any letter they mail to you. How's that?

LASSITER:
(aside to SHAWN) Like he's just going to give him his name.

LUNTZ:
Phil, that's good. I've got a nephew named Phillip.

LUNTZ walks in front of SHAWN and LASSITER and they share a look like "Do you believe this guy?".

LUNTZ:
He's a real rascal. He's got a killer arm for an eight-year-old. He plays right field. What's your last name, Phil?

VICK and JULIET arrive as he's talking.

PHIL:
Get 'em back!

LUNTZ:
Well, I just need to know who I'm dealing with. That's how I can help you. Otherwise, these guys with the guns, they get really, really nervous. So, if we get to know each other, we can be friends. Then I can vouch for you, and I can protect you. I protect all my friends.

PHIL:
Stubbins.

LUNTZ:
(taps BUZZ) Stubbins.

BUZZ:
I'm on it. (leaves)

A WOMAN calls from outside the tape.

WOMAN:
My fianc√©, Michael Lenhart is in there. He's a diabetic. He's going to need to eat soon. Help him, please.

JULIET:
(to WOMAN) Okay, okay, just stay calm. (whispers in LUNTZ' ear) Hey. There's a woman over there who is hysterical. Her fianc√©'s inside. He's a diabetic.

SHAWN sees JULIET put her hand on LUNTZ' arm and LUNTZ leans in a bit too close.

LUNTZ:
Uh, now, look, Phil, nobody is in a rush here. I'm in this for the long haul as long as you are, so we'll take our time, but you have a bunch of hungry people in there and you've got a young guy who's a diabetic and his fianc√©e is out here worried about him. You know how women worry. So, it would go a long way if you let me send you guys some food in there. You like pizza?

>>>LATER>>>

A couple of FBI agents walk past with pizzas. SHAWN is walking with LASSITER and JULIET.

LASSITER:
That's because you don't understand how protocol works. And you may have gotten Guster in real trouble in there dialing his cell phone.

SHAWN:
At least I did something.

JULIET:
Look, Shawn. He is SWAT. And he is good at what he does. I am fine with backing off here.

SHAWN stops and looks back before turn to answer JULIET.

SHAWN:
He's SWAT? He's SWAT? That's your argument? He's not Colin Farrell.

JULIET:
I get that you are concerned about Gus, but I can assure you he is in capable hands.

SHAWN remembers when JULIET spoke to LUNTZ and he put his hand on the small of her back.

SHAWN:
Wait a minute. I get what's happening here.

JULIET:
You do?

SHAWN:
Yes, I do. I'm sensing a relationship here.

JULIET:
You are?

LASSITER looks at her.

SHAWN:
Yes. You and Luntz. There's a familial thing happening. He's like an older uncle. What? Are you related to him?

LASSITER:
Not yet.

JULIET:
Lassiter!

LASSITER:
What? He's psychic. Shouldn't he know already?

SHAWN:
Know what? What is he getting at?

JULIET:
It's nothing. But I do know Cameron... Luntz. Commander Cameron Luntz.

SHAWN:
Cameron?

JULIET:
Yes. And he's not my uncle. I met him at a police district conference. He asked me out. We went on a few dates. I like him.

SHAWN:
(laughs) Oh, my God! You're dating this guy?

LASSITER:
(grins) Ding, ding, ding! Tell him what he won, O'Hara.

JULIET:
Lassiter!

LASSITER leaves.

JULIET:
Look, Shawn. I was...

SHAWN:
Don't... Don't... Don't worry. It's fine, Jules, really. Dare I say, dandy? Isn't that a word from his generation?

JULIET:
That's not fair. And, look, I was going to talk to you about it earlier, but...

SHAWN:
That's great. It's really great, congratulations. I'm so, so happy for you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a best friend to save. (leaves)

JULIET sighs and watches him go. SHAWN goes to the van where LUNTZ and VICK are watching video. Behind them, FBI agents are preparing to deliver the pizzas.

SHAWN:
Chief, elder Commanding Officer Luntz, you need to let me get involved here. You need to let me scope things out.

VICK:
Absolutely not. You're not a trained tactical officer, Spencer.

LUNTZ:
Are we positive he's even house-trained?

SHAWN:
(scoffs) Okay. All right, maybe you and I got off on the wrong foot. And you know what? You're correct. I have had a few close calls around the house recently. But I can help you.

LUNTZ:
Oh? How's that?

SHAWN:
What do you know about this guy, other than his name?

LUNTZ:
We know that he's a longtime customer of this bank. Owed a huge load of back taxes to the IRS, he's just had his house foreclosed on. And he's a middle child. (pours breath freshener onto his tongue)

VICK:
You know he's a middle child?

LUNTZ:
I could hear it in the timbre of his voice, and the fact that he doesn't use contractions, yes.

SHAWN:
Okay, fine. What about everyone else in the bank? Look, you send your guy in there and what? Maybe he gets you a guesstimate of how many hostages there are? I can walk into that bank, I can psychically read every single hostage and Stubbins.

LUNTZ:
He's freaked out. He won't talk to you.

SHAWN:
He doesn't need to. I can read his mind.

LUNTZ:
Can you read my mind right now? 'Cause it's sending a very clear message where I want you to be.

Cut to SHAWN standing behind the police barricade. A cell phone rings in the van and one of the officers passes it to LUNTZ.

OFFICER:
Sir!

LUNTZ: (into phone)
Luntz here.

PHIL: (over phone)
Do you think I'm stupid?

LUNTZ: (into phone)
What are you talking about?

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

PHIL:
I can see what you are doing. You are sending a cop in here with the pizzas.

LUNTZ:
Look, Phil. Calm down now. That's just for everybody's safety, that's all.

PHIL:
Well, it is not happening.

LUNTZ:
I'll bring them up there myself if you like.

PHIL:
I do not think so. You will send in a regular person.

LUNTZ:
Regular person?

PHIL:
Yes, a regular person. You will send in someone from behind those barricades. A regular person, not a cop.

LUNTZ leans around the van and sees SHAWN who slowly raises his hand.

>>>LATER>>>

SHAWN walks up to the bank door carrying the pizzas. He sets them down on the ground and raises a hand to say "wait a minute" as he inspects them. LUNTZ sees this.

LUNTZ:
What the hell is he doing?

SHAWN:
I wouldn't accept these if I were you.

LUNTZ:
(takes a few steps) Spencer! Just put the pizzas down and walk away. Get outta there.

SHAWN:
(stands up with pizzas) Eight pies, four of them are vegetable. (turns around)

LUNTZ:
What? Is this guy for real?

SHAWN:
No pepperoni? Really? Plus the blatant disregard and utter criminal lack of ham and pineapple?

LUNTZ:
Spencer...

SHAWN:
What kind of good faith negotiation, is this? (backs up to door) I mean, this is a hostage negotiation.

LUNTZ:
Well, I don't care if you're not happy with the ingredients! Put the pizzas down and walk away!

SHAWN:
(to PHIL) I won't let you accept these.

LUNTZ:
Walk away! This is my operation! (to armed men) Go get him. Go get him out of there!

SHAWN:
He's not going to accept these-- aah!

PHIL grabs his arm and pulls SHAWN into the bank, locking the door behind them.

OFFICER:
All right, then, move! Fan out! Fan out! Fan out! Go, go, go, go!

LUNTZ:
Spencer! (sighs) Terrific.

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

PHIL has SHAWN enter in front of him and motions with the gun.

PHIL:
Put those pizzas down right over there.

SHAWN notices that the gun's safety is on. He sets the pizzas down on the middle island. GUS tenses a little on seeing him. SHAWN turns to face PHIL, hands up.

SHAWN:
All right, Phil, I'm just as mad about this as you are. Why don't you let me go out there and make this right? And on the way back in, I'll have them throw in a couple liters of old-fashioned root beer and some Cinnastars. They're like Cinnadots, they're just-- they're pointy. They're good. They're not great. But I can get them, free of charge. I'll be right back.

SHAWN starts to leave but PHIL grabs him by the shoulder and pulls him close, holding the gun on him.

PHIL:
You're not going anywhere. You've just become my next hostage.

>>>LATER>>>

PHIL has some of the hostages behind the counter, some in front and a few in the waiting area. They are all without shoes. SHAWN and GUS are next to each other and have a whispered conversation.

GUS:
Why does he keep separating everybody?

SHAWN:
Jules is dating an old SWAT guy?

GUS:
We're in a hostage situation, Shawn. You don't get that?

SHAWN:
I do get it. What I don't get is the bulletproof vest over the shirt, what is that?

GUS:
I'm telling you, something's not right with this guy. I mean, he makes us take our shoes off. Who does that? why?

SHAWN:
It's a way of containing people. You know, slowing them down and whatnot.

GUS:
So we can't run away when he starts shooting us! He's going to start killing us off one-by-one. Oh, my God.

SHAWN:
Would you please relax? Clearly, I have a handle on the situation.

GUS:
A handle? A handle! You mouthed off to him and got yourself taken hostage!

SHAWN:
Of course I did. That was my plan all along, you sweet dollop of spicy goodness. I had to get myself in there, so I could see what I'm dealing with. And I have this feeling that we are not dealing with the person they think we are. Why would a bank robber keep his gun safety on? So help me out. Think. What do you remember seeing the moment that the robbery went down? Features? Noses? Maybe a chin?

GUS:
I did see a chin, a beautiful one. A glorious one.

GUS leans forward and looks down the line to the cashier he was eyeing earlier. She is sitting next to an older Asian woman.

SHAWN:
There's a good chance she's over a hundred. Are you sure you've thought this through?

GUS:
Not her, Shawn!

SHAWN:
Oh.

GUS:
I've had a lot of time to think in here, Shawn. And I've realized some things about life.

SHAWN:
It's been two hours.

GUS:
Yes. But two hours hostage time. Things happen fast in here Shawn. Life is fleeting. And I need to live it. I need to say the things I'm feeling and act on those feelings before it's too late. And so do you.

SHAWN:
Okay. In other news... Phil! Phil!

SHAWN raises his hand and waves it to get PHIL'S attention.

GUS:
What are you... What are you doing? You want to get yourself shot?

GUS tries to hold SHAWN down but he gets up just as PHIL comes over.

PHIL:
What?

GUS:
Sorry. Nothing. Our bad. You just go back to your whole robbering thing.

SHAWN:
I need to potty. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (faces hostages) I'm sorry, everyone. I downed an Orange Julius right before I was taken captive And it--it went right through me. (turns back) I need to potty, okay? Look, I know my body, and I know my stomach, and this could get really ugly.

PHIL:
All right. All right, all right. All right, don't anybody move. I'm watching you. I'm just going to be right here. Don't move. (escorts SHAWN out)

INT. BANK, HALL, DAY

PHIL has SHAWN walk the hall between the enclosed glass offices. PHIL keeps a hand on SHAWN'S shoulder while the other holds the gun.

SHAWN:
You know I'm not really a regular person, right, Phil?

PHIL:
What does that mean?

SHAWN:
'Cause I tried once and failed. I'm just too unique and interesting. The French call it du fromage, Which, loosely translated, means "of cheese."

They walk through the breakroom and stop in front of the bathrooms.

SHAWN:
The truth is, I'm actually a psychic, a professional one. And I am getting a major reading right in here. (moves his hand in front of PHIL)

PHIL:
You are?

SHAWN:
(hisses) There it goes again. (puts hand to his head)

PHIL:
What? What's it saying?

SHAWN:
It's saying that you are a middle child.

PHIL:
Yes, yes, I am!

SHAWN:
It is also saying that you are not a bank robber.

PHIL'S eyes widen. He looks back to the lobby then whirls SHAWN around.

PHIL:
You know this?

SHAWN:
Yes. Very much so. There is something else at play here, Phil. Something nefarious and also evil.

PHIL:
Oh, God! (hugs SHAWN) You do know. (hugs again)

SHAWN:
All right. Okay.

PHIL:
I can't keep up this ruse any longer. Please, how's my wife?

SHAWN:
Your wife?

PHIL:
Yes, is she scared?

SHAWN:
Is she scared? Uh... Yes, she is scared.

PHIL:
Oh, my God. Joanna, I'm so sorry. Can you, can you get a message to her?

SHAWN:
(hesitates) Yes, I believe I can, yes.

PHIL:
(speaks into SHAWN'S ear) Joanna. Joanna. Listen, Joanna, this morning I was confronted by a man, I don't know who, and he told me that he had kidnapped you and was holding you somewhere, and if I didn't walk into this bank right then and get him these diamonds and drop them in a mailbox down the road, he was going to kill you. I screwed up. And I don't know how to get out of this, honey. I'm so sorry.

SHAWN:
Oh, wow. Phil, that was something. I mean, it was just really jam-packed with, uh, information. It was also a little breathy. Oddly soothing. She said not to worry. Everything is going to be okay.

PHIL:
(speaks into SHAWN'S ear) But how?

SHAWN:
You don't have to...

PHIL:
Okay, yeah. But how? I mean, I feel like I'm being watched. By the cops, by someone in here.

SHAWN:
Phil, I will help you, but you have to trust me. I'm working with the police department. I know who all the players are out there. I will get you out of this bank and I will find out where your wife is. But you have to let me lead this negotiation. Do you think you can do that?

PHIL:
I think so.

SHAWN:
Okay, here's the plan. First, keep up the crazy guy routine. We need that.

PHIL:
All right.

SHAWN:
But do not speak to anyone here, unless I am with you. Secondly, you're going to have to give me some privacy. I wasn't kidding about the Orange Julius.

SHAWN slips into the bathroom.

EXT. BANK, DAY

At the van, the cell phone rings and an officer passes it to LUNTZ.

LUNTZ:
Luntz here.

INT. BANK, BATHROOM, DAY

SHAWN paces in the stall.

SHAWN:
I have some info for you. Stubbins is not behind this. Someone...

LUNTZ:
Look, Spencer, the first thing you gotta realize about these guys is that they will try to manipulate anybody they can to get out of there alive. I think that you have interfered and screwed up enough, don't you? Why don't you find yourself a quiet little corner in there and lay low. Copy? (ends call)

SHAWN:
But I'm telling... (sighs and closes phone)

LUNTZ:
Kenny, I need to talk to you!

KENNY:
Yes, sir. What's up, sir?

LASSITER is walking along the sidewalk when his phone rings.

LASSITER:
Hello?

SHAWN:
Lhasa apsos. I have an idea that might put you back front and center on this case.

LASSITER:
I'm listening.

SHAWN:
Stubbins isn't behind the robbery. Somebody kidnapped his wife and put him up to it.

LASSITER:
Spencer, you know that sounds a little nutsy, right?

SHAWN:
What do you have to lose? Just send a couple black and whites out to look for the wife and see what blows back.

LASSITER:
How can you be so sure that sh-(hears flushing) What was that sound? (call ends) Spencer? (closes phone) Hey, McNabb!

BUZZ:
(hurries over) Yes, sir.

LASSITER:
I've got something I'm going to send you out on.

BUZZ:
Okay.

The two walk off.

INT. BANK, MANAGER'S OFFICE, DAY

PHIL:
What are we doing in the bank manager's office?

SHAWN is sitting at the desk with his feet up. PHIL is standing in the doorway.

SHAWN:
I've taken the liberty of putting together a list of demands that you can give to Luntz. (throws a legal pad onto the desk)

PHIL:
Demands?

SHAWN:
Yep. Yeah, we're going to call out there and you're just going to read these off to him.

PHIL walks over and picks up the pad and reads.

PHIL:
"My Demands by Phil. An airplane to take me wherever I want. Tour bus, blue, with full tank of gas and groupies."

SHAWN:
That's non-negotiable.

PHIL:
"$5,000 in unmarked bills." This is a huge list. What if they won't give me any of this stuff?

SHAWN:
I don't expect them to, Phil. That's just to buy us time, so that we can figure out who in here has put you up to this.

PHIL:
"A zip line pulley system used to transport deliciously flavored snacks and such from one location to another." What is this?

SHAWN:
Look, just call out to Luntz, okay? And remember, I need to speak to him first.

As PHIL dials using the landline, SHAWN sees a list of foreclosures on the desk and files away the names and addresses.

PHIL:
Luntz, it's Phil.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

EXT. BANK, DAY

LUNTZ:
Hey there, friend. I was wondering why I haven't heard from you.

PHIL:
Well, I'm going to put Shawn... Spencer? Shawn Spencer on the phone. He will be negotiating on my behalf from here on in. (hands the phone to SHAWN)

LUNTZ:
No, no, Phil. Don't do that. That's a mistake. This is between you and me...

SHAWN:
Hey, Cam, it's Shawn. What's up, buddy?

LUNTZ:
(sighs) Spencer, put Stubbins on the phone now.

SHAWN:
Eeh, that's, uh... That's going to be a little awkward. uh-- I'm not really sure how to put this, and bear with me because this is my first hostage negotiation. But it would appear that I am, in fact, making the demands now. So why don't you go ahead and put Detective O'Hara on the phone, please.

LUNTZ:
Why in the world would I do that?

SHAWN:
Oh, I don't know, isn't the timbre of my voice telling you why?

After a pause, LUNTZ hands the phone to JULIET.

LUNTZ:
It's Spencer.

JULIET:
Shawn, are you all right?

SHAWN:
Jules, how serious is this thing with you and Luntz, really?

JULIET:
(sighs) I'm so not having this conversation with you right now.

SHAWN:
Is he standing next to you, sniffing your hair? Huh? Is he listening to me?

The agents monitoring the phone look over at her.

JULIET:
Shawn, half the Santa Barbara Police Department can hear us.

SHAWN:
Okay, fine, you're right. I'm sorry, I don't know what I was thinking. Just... Just answer me this. Does he have those older guy boobies that sort of droop at the ends?

The agents laugh.

JULIET:
Okay, I'm hanging up on you now.

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on. I'm putting Phil... I'm putting Phil on for Luntz.

Both SHAWN and JULIET pass the phone.

LUNTZ:
Hey there, buddy. You there?

PHIL:
Yeah. Okay. First, I need a plane.

LUNTZ chuckles in disbelief, knowing SHAWN created the list.

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

SHAWN rejoins the hostages and sits so the MANAGER is between him and GUS.

SHAWN:
Oh, gosh.

SHAWN opens a bag of cookies, making noise. GUS shushes him.

SHAWN:
(whispers) This bank sucks. Wait a minute, you're the bank manager.

MANAGER:
Yes. I'm Nathanial Gresling.

SHAWN:
Do you recall rejecting a small business loan for a zip line snack transportation system, calling it, and I quote, "fiscally irresponsible"?

GUS:
Shawn...

GRESLING:
Yes, I do.

SHAWN:
Well, Mr. Nathanial Gresling, this little task of retrieving the Mini Oreos took me 14 seconds. Zip line? (makes whooshing noise) Five. Fiscally irresponsible? Nay! I call that my fiscal obligation to my shareholders, namely, Gus here.

GUS:
Shawn!

GRESLING:
Look, I'm sorry, you think that was all my decision? I'm just a dupe for the upper management. I don't have the power you think I do.

GUS:
We understand, Mr. Gresling. I'm still a little fuzzy on the details. Do you remember what happened this morning, when Mr. Stubbins came to the bank?

GRESLING:
I remember him entering the bank and he approached me.

The scene is intercut with flashbacks as GRESLING tells his story.

GRESLING:
I was busy with a customer but he caught my attention.

We see that GRESLING is lying. There was no customer and he approached PHIL.

GRESLING:
He asked me to take him to the safety deposit vault, which I did.

GUS:
Hmm.

GRESLING:
Once inside the vault he drew his gun.

We see that GRESLING raises his hands before PHIL takes the gun from his pocket.

SHAWN:
How do you suppose he knew about the diamonds?

GRESLING:
The diamonds were deposited in that particular box one week prior. I very distinctly remember Mr. Stubbins being in the bank that day.

GUS:
How do you distinctly remember that?

GRESLING:
Well, the gentleman who deposited the diamonds was a very wealthy customer, who management considers to be a VIP client. Therefore, I'm instructed to treat him as such.

GUS:
Right.

GRESLING:
Mr. Stubbins was in the bank before to get to his safety deposit box, but I skipped him over.

GUS:
Oh, that never feels good.

GRESLING:
He was very upset. He complained. I felt bad for him and maybe this was my mistake, but I told him that the gentleman was depositing some very valuable merchandise.

GUS:
Oh.

GRESLING:
Therefore, he knew about the diamonds.

GUS:
Right.

SHAWN:
Don't beat yourself up, man. It's not your fault.

GRESLING:
Thank you very much.

GUS sighs and looks away.

SHAWN:
God. (winces and holds stomach) Nothing is agreeing with me today. Excuse me. I'm going to have to, uh, take care of some more business. (leaves)

PHIL is holding the phone to his ear as he watches LUNTZ through the window. SHAWN returns from the bathroom and walks over.

SHAWN:
Phil, buddy. What're you doing?

PHIL:
They're going to meet all my demands.

SHAWN:
Seriously? Even the plane?

PHIL:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
What about the snack line?

PHIL:
Yeah.

SHAWN'S eyes practically bug out.

PHIL:
Um, they wanted me to come take a look at the bus. It's not blue. Is that okay?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

EXT. BANK, DAY

LUNTZ: (into radio)
You have a shot, take it.

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

Looking out the window, SHAWN sees a sniper on the roof. He then sees the red dot on PHIL's chest that marks the sight for the shooter. He tackles PHIL to the floor just before the shot comes through the window.

EXT. BANK, DAY

LUNTZ and VICK are behind a car.

SNIPER:
That's a negative on the target, sir.

LUNTZ:
How did you miss?

SNIPER:
He just fell out of my scope. Very strange.

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

GUS and the other hostages look over at SHAWN with disbelief. He had just saved the life of the man holding them, prolonging the situation. The looks soon turn to hate.

SHAWN:
Free hugs. Who's next?

INT. HENRY'S, KITCHEN

HENRY still has the news on the TV.

SUE ELLEN:
Well, we're still coming to you from outside the National Savings Bank where the hostage situation has escalated. Shawn Spencer, psychic detective for the Santa Barbara Police Department, is now inside the bank. And is not only a hostage...

HENRY:
You got to be kidding me.

SUE ELLEN:
...he appears to be calling the shots on behalf of the now-named assailant, Phillip Stubbins.

HENRY:
Oh, this can't be good.

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

SHAWN scurries over to GUS on his hands and knees and sits with a groan.

GUS:
Dude, don't even sit by me right now. They already hate me for the phone thing, I don't need them to know I'm friends with the guy that kept them from being rescued.

SHAWN:
Okay, you know something, maybe before you admonish me with that tone of voice, you'd like to hear my insanely good news.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
As a sign of cooperation, Phil and I are going to release a hostage, you happy now?

GUS:
(shakes SHAWN) Yes, yes, yes, yes yes, yes, yes, yes!

SHAWN:
Okay.

GUS:
I knew you would get me released! Thank you!

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Dude, it's not you.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
Think about it for a minute.

GUS:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm a horrible person. There's older people here and women.

PHIL:
Shawn, are you ready?

SHAWN:
Phil, I will be with you in one minute.

PHIL leaves.

GUS:
What? You are the hostage being released?

SHAWN:
Gus...

GUS:
I can't believe this.

SHAWN:
I have a hunch about where Phil's wife is being held. I think it's directly linked to a list of foreclosed houses in the area. And I have to check it out. Don't you see? It's got to be me.

GUS:
Just figure this out and get me out of here before there's a red laser light shining on my forehead. And be careful, Shawn.

SHAWN:
I will, buddy. (stands)

GUS:
(stands and puts a hand on SHAWN'S arm) Oh, and, Shawn, I just want you to know that no matter what happens, I care about you and I appreciate you. And, well, I love you, Shawn. (hugs him)

SHAWN:
Okay, buddy, I hear ya. (pats him awkwardly on the back) You know I'm going to be back in, like, half an hour, right? Wow, that is a tight hug. All right. All right. Okay.

Later, SHAWN is walking towards the door with PHIL.

SHAWN:
Okay, I'm pretty sure Gresling is our guy.

PHIL:
You are?

SHAWN:
Yeah. This morning when you walked into the bank, you didn't find him, he found you. His hands were quicker than your gun.

PHIL:
What?

SHAWN:
Just stay away from him, say nothing. Do not pick up the bank line. Do not field any calls until I return. Okay?

PHIL unlocks the door and SHAWN opens it partway.

PHIL:
All right. Shawn, I love my wife.

SHAWN:
I know you do, man. (goes outside)

EXT. BANK, DAY

SHAWN exits the bank and squints at the sun, using his hands to block the light. JULIET spots him with the binoculars.

LUNTZ:
All right, go get him.

SHAWN raises an arm in response to the cheers and applause. Three SWAT officers grab him and bring him to the van. JULIET, VICK and LASSITER rush over.

LUNTZ:
All right, put him in a holding van. I want to debrief him.

LASSITER:
(pulls SHAWN'S free arm) No, no. No way, Luntz. This is our guy. Any debriefing is going to be done by us.

LUNTZ:
No, this is my investigation.

The SWAT officer pulls SHAWN'S other arm.

SHAWN:
Well, guys, guys, I appreciate you arguing over me, but let me just point out, I'm not wearing briefs.

VICK:
Commander Luntz, Mr. Spencer is in our department, so we will debrief him first, but we'll share any information that we gather.

LASSITER:
Hands off. (pulls SHAWN away)

HENRY:
(behind barricade) Shawn! Shawn!

SHAWN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dad? (holds up a finger)

LASSITER:
Hurry up.

SHAWN:
(walks over) What are you doing down here?

HENRY:
Look, I don't know what you and Gus have gotten yourselves into, but I came down here to warn you.

SHAWN:
Warn me of what?

HENRY:
This guy doing the negotiating, he's done negotiating.

They look over at LUNTZ who is signing a form on a clipboard.

SHAWN:
Meaning?

HENRY:
He's getting ready to take this guy out.

SHAWN:
Yeah, Dad, I know. He already took a shot.

HENRY:
Yes, but Shawn, he's getting ready to go in with tear gas. I've seen it before. It's not pretty.

SHAWN:
(sighs) How much time do I have?

HENRY:
I don't know. Hour, tops.

SHAWN:
(sighs) All right. Thanks, Dad.

SHAWN starts to go but HENRY grabs his arm.

HENRY:
Shawn, you be careful.

SHAWN:
All right.

The crowd whoops as DHAWN jogs past the barricade. He stops when he sees a pretty woman and goes back to shake her hand.

SHAWN:
Hi. Shawn Spencer. Thanks for coming out. It means a lot.

HENRY:
Shawn!

SHAWN continues on his way and meets LASSITER at the police van.

SHAWN:
Look, Lassie, I am telling you that Stubbins is not behind this and I know at the very least that Gresling, the bank manager, is involved.

LASSITER:
It's a moot point. He's going to do what he's going to do. There are hostages in there.

SHAWN:
I know that, my best friend is one of them. If we can get out of here and find this guy's wife, we can show that the kidnapping thing holds water.

LASSITER:
Look, I am breaking about 50 codes of police procedure just by talking to you about this.

SHAWN:
Ugh, the codes! That is your biggest problem.

LASSITER:
Oh, it's my problem?

SHAWN:
Yeah, just once, can you grab life by the little Lassiters and follow your instincts? I know you don't like my methods, I know you don't like me. But we are pressed for time and I am telling you, I am vibing like crazy. Can we screw protocol and get the hell outta here?

LASSITER closes the back door of the van and SHAWN rolls his eyes.

LASSITER:
You take shotgun. (walks to driver's side)

SHAWN:
You are so sexy right now.

SHAWN goes around to the passenger side and uses hand signals to let JULIET know. He starts bouncing on his feet and waving his arm to get her to join them. She walks past LUNTZ.

LUNTZ:
Where are you going?

JULIET:
I'm sorry, but you're not the only one here who has a job to do. (walks away)

LUNTZ:
Well, wait. Are we still on for tonight?

INT, POLICE VAN, DAY

LASSITER is driving, SHAWN is shotgun and JULIET is in the back.

LASSITER:
All right, where am I driving?

SHAWN:
Just head down to State Street. Then you're going to be making a left on Laporte. (remembers address) Yes, left. I'm being drawn there by the wife now. (lowers hand) All right, Jules. Give me one good reason why you find this guy attractive.

JULIET:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
You can't give me one?

JULIET:
I can think of many.

SHAWN:
Is one of them that you're looking forward to giving him sponge baths in the near future?

JULIET:
I happen to find his age and his maturity appealing. He's distinguished and virile. And most importantly, he knows who he is. And that is attractive.

LASSITER:
You two know I'm in the van, right?

SHAWN:
(looks out window) Here! Stop here!

LASSITER stops the van in front of a non-descript brown house.

SHAWN:
This is it. She's being held right in there.

LASSITER:
(checks weapon) All right, Spencer. You stay put. I will not be responsible for you. O'Hara, we go on three. You ready? One, two...

SHAWN:
Can I say it? Let me say it.

JULIET and LASSITER exit the van.

EXT. HOUSE, DAY

JULIET and LASSITER approach stealthily, guns drawn. SHAWN watches from the van. LASSITER goes first into the open car port. He takes one side of the house and JULIET goes down the other. SHAWN is waiting for her.

SHAWN:
Hey.

JULIET:
(whispers) Shawn, get back in the car, this could be dangerous.

SHAWN:
I will, but I have to tell you something.

JULIET:
Shawn, get back in the car!

SHAWN:
Go out with Luntz.

JULIET:
What?

SHAWN:
I want you to go out with Luntz.

SHAWN presses himself against the wall as he and JULIET make their way along the side of the house.

JULIET:
Shawn! What are you trying to pull?

SHAWN:
I'm not trying to pull anything. I just want you to be happy. So, if you think this guy can make you happy or even if you're not sure and there's just a tiny part of you that thinks that there might be a chance for that, I think you owe it to yourself to go for it.

JULIET peers around the corner and sees LASSITER on the other side who holds up his palm. She leans back against the wall next to SHAWN.

JULIET:
Thank you, Shawn.

SHAWN:
You're welcome. When are you supposed to go out next?

JULIET:
Uh, tonight actually...

SHAWN:
Wow! That's so fast. Where's he going to take you?

JULIET:
Mario's.

SHAWN:
Mario's? That place is a little stuffy, don't you think?

JULIET looks around the corner as LASSITER counts down with his fingers.

JULIET:
I like their bread.

JULIET and LASSITER take up position by the back door. LASSITER tries the doorknob. When it doesn't open, he kicks the door down.

INT. HOUSE, DAY

LASSITER and JULIET check the rooms by the door.

LASSITER:
Clear.

JULIET:
Clear.

They go to enter the room where JOANNA is tied up but SHAWN is already there.

LASSITER:
Split! Spencer, what the hell are you doing? I told you to stay in the car.

SHAWN looks out the back window and sees footprints in the grass, a swing still moving and a gate in the back fence.

SHAWN:
If I'd stayed in the car, I wouldn't be able to tell you that someone just took off running that way through the yard!

LASSITER:
(checks) They're gone. I'll call in a perimeter request. Get K-9 down here.

JULIET and SHAWN help JOANNA.

JULIET:
You want to help me with this gag?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

SHAWN kneels and undoes the gag while JULIET unties her hands.

SHAWN:
Hello, Joanna. I have a message from your husband.

EXT. BANK, DAY

LUNTZ is on his radio.

LUNTZ:
I'm going to try to make contact one more time and then that's it. Prepare to go in with the gas.

He then picks up his phone.

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

Someone throws a shoe over at GUS, startling him. The phone starts ringing. PHIL keeps checking his watch, impatient. He then goes over to GRESLING.

PHIL:
You, come on.

GRESLING:
What do you want?

PHIL:
(pulls GRESLING up by the collar) Come on, right now.

GRESLING:
Why? What do you want?

PHIL:
Right now.

GRESLING:
Oh!

PHIL:
(to the hostages) Don't move! Don't talk! Look at the floor! Look at the floor!

PHIL pushes GRESLING down the hall.

PHIL:
Come on. Right now.

GRESLING:
What?

PHIL:
Right now. In here, in here. Get in there. (shoves him into the office)

INT. BANK, MANAGER'S OFFICE, DAY

GRESLING:
What?

PHIL closes the door and pushes GRESLING against the wall and aims the gun at him.

PHIL:
You have my wife.

GRESLING:
What are you talking about?

PHIL:
You know where she is. Tell me where she is. Tell me where she is.

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

The hostages can hear them arguing.

INT. BANK, MANAGER'S OFFICE, DAY

GRESLING:
I don't know what you're talking about!

PHIL:
You know where she is. Tell me where she is.

GRESLING:
I swear. You're crazy.

PHIL:
Where's my wife?!

GRESLING:
I don't know!

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

While PHIL and GRESLING continue to argue, GUS crawls on all fours.

INT. BANK, MANAGER'S OFFICE, DAY

PHIL:
I'm gonna shoot you right now! Where's my wife?

INT. HOUSE, DAY

JOANNA remains sitting on the chair as LASSITER kneels beside her. SHAWN and JULIET stand to the side.

LASSITER:
All right, Mrs. Stubbins, what can you tell us about the man that kidnapped you?

JOANNA:
Well, there were actually two men.

SHAWN:
Two? Are you sure?

INT. BANK, MANAGER'S OFFICE, DAY

PHIL:
Where's my wife?

An unknown person knocks PHIL out from behind.

INT. BANK, HALL, DAY

GUS creeps along the hall and listens at the office door.

INT. HOUSE, DAY

JOANNA:
I was blindfolded, but through a crack in the bottom, I was able to make out two pairs of feet. I didn't see much, but I know one of them was wearing a pair of brown wing-tip shoes.

SHAWN goes through his memory of all the shoes of the hostages at the bank.

SHAWN:
I got it. The other one's in the bank. I gotta call Phil and warn him.

INT. BANK, HALL, DAY

GUS hears the phone ring. He opens the door to the office and puts his hands up when a gun is aimed at him.

EXT. BANK, DAY

LUNTZ: (into radio)
That's it, men, it's go time. Hit 'em with the tear gas, and go in on my call.

The SWAT members shout orders to each other as they take position and aim their weapons at the bank.

INT. BANK, OFFICE, DAY

The man who ratted GUS out about his phone has his gun aimed at GUS, PHIL and GRESLING. They are bound and have duct tape over their mouths.

INT, POLICE VAN, DAY

LASSITER is driving, SHAWN is shotgun and JULIET is in the back.

JULIET:
Morgan Phelps is the second man inside the bank. Canine caught the guy running away from the house who gave him up. But I don't get the bank manager. Gresling knew the bank was going to be robbed?

SHAWN:
He planned the whole thing from the beginning. He knew that his VIP client had dropped off the diamonds. He figured this was his chance to score big, so he contacted Morgan Phelps.

JULIET:
Who has a rap sheet as long as my arm.

LASSITER:
So why didn't Phelps just steal the diamonds himself?

SHAWN:
They didn't need a professional bank robber because Gresling would basically just be handing the diamonds over. And Phil was a perfect mark. They could put him in the bank on the day the diamonds were delivered. That, plus the back taxes and the recent foreclosure made him seem like a really desperate guy who need cash in a big way.

LASSITER:
So Phelps plants himself at the bank to make sure everything goes smoothly and then finds himself caught as a hostage when the whole deal goes sour.

JULIET:
I'll keep trying Luntz, but I'm pretty sure he's blocked all calls not coming from inside the bank. We need to get back there before he goes in.

EXT. BANK, DAY

The van arrives at the bank. SHAWN and LASSITER go over to LUNZ while JULIET goes to VICK.

SHAWN:
Luntz! Have your guys grab Gresling, the bank manager. Take him into custody. He's in on it. We're looking for Phelps.

GUS joins them.

LUNTZ:
Who?

SHAWN:
Phelps. Have you accounted for all the hostages?

LUNTZ:
We're counting bodies now. It's a mess out here.

SHAWN:
All right.

SHAWN runs into the bank followed by LASSITER, LUNTZ and GUS.

INT. BANK, LOBBY, DAY

SHAWN looks at the remaining shoes.

SHAWN:
There's no wing-tips. Phelps is gone. He must've taken off somewhere. When did you last see him?

GUS:
We were being held in a back room.

INT. BANK, OFFICE, DAY

They enter the room and SHAWN'S gaze goes straight to the air shaft. He then sees a screw on the floor. He puts a hand to his head.

SHAWN:
I know where Phelps is.

LASSITER:
Where?

SHAWN:
He's in the sewer. He's in the sewer system.

LUNTZ:
(checking closet) That's ridiculous.

SHAWN:
Is it, Luntz?

LASSITER:
All right, I do know this much. If someone were to access the sewer system out back it would dump them almost anywhere in the city.

SHAWN:
Luntz, I'm a psychic, you're just going to have to trust me. Plus, listen to my voice. It's even. It's steady. No vibrato.

LUNTZ runs from the room. SHAWN hurries to the vent and pulls the cover off.

SHAWN:
Gus, quick! Help me boost Lassie up to the ceiling. Phelps is inside one of these ducts.

LASSITER:
What? Whatever happened to the whole psychic sewer vision thing?

SHAWN:
Lassie, do we really have time to answer these questions? Now, come on. Just give me one of those size 12 narrows.

LASSITER puts one foot in SHAWN'S cupped hands as he reaches for the opening.

GUS:
Give me the other.

SHAWN and GUS lift LASSITER up and he pulls himself in with a grunt.

INT. BANK, AIR DUCTS, DAY

LASSITER crawls through the duct on his stomach, gun in hand. PHELPS has paused, listening. He hears LASSITER grunt and starts moving. LASSITER comes to an intersection and sees PHELPS.

LASSITER:
Freeze!

He grabs PHELPS' legs.

LASSITER:
Come here. Hold still. I got him!

INT. BANK, OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN:
Good work, partner! We'll grab backup.

EXT. BANK, DAY

SHAWN and GUS exit the bank.

GUS:
Partner? Uh, excuse me? What was that about?

SHAWN:
Well, you got to admit, it's better than a little boy cat or a little girl cat.

GUS:
Not appreciated, Shawn.

SHAWN:
But, look at you, man, surviving a bank hostage crisis and still looking all "Poitier on a hot day".

GUS:
What? (touches the side of his nose with his thumb)

SHAWN:
Go ahead, slap me in the face. Tell me they call you "Mr. Tibbs".

GUS:
I'm not doing that.

SHAWN:
Come on, it'll make you feel better.

GUS:
They call me Mr... I'm not doing that.

SHAWN:
(laughs) Look at you. You were one word away! Come on. What do they call you?

GUS:
Will you get in the car?

SHAWN:
(gets in car) They call you, what? They call you Mr... (laughs)

INT. PSYCH, NIGHT

SHAWN is trying to unstick a sliding door when there's a knocking. He turns around to see JULIET dressed for a date.

SHAWN:
Jules!

JULIET:
Hi.

SHAWN:
What are you...

JULIET:
(holds out a pair of shoes) Uh, Evidence turned these over to me. I think they're Gus' shoes. So, I just... I thought I'd bring them by and drop them off. (sets them on a desk)

SHAWN:
That is very sweet of you. You can burn them.

JULIET:
What?

SHAWN:
He was devastated the whole way home. He cried about them already, on my shoulder, like a baby. I just put him down. He's resting now. So what is this? What am I seeing here? (motions up and down with his hand) This is the, uh, "returning footwear to a friend" outfit?

JULIET:
Oh, Cameron had to cancel tonight.

SHAWN:
No.

JULIET:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
No!

JULIET:
Yeah, he said he took, like, four showers, but he still couldn't get that sewer smell out of his skin.

SHAWN:
Aw, jeez! That damn sewer! We wrapped everything up so nicely so that you guys could... But you know what? The man followed a hunch. And that's all you can ask from a guy. Hey, follow your hunches. And he did. I'm sorry it didn't work out for you kids. But you gave it a real shot, a fair shot.

JULIET:
Shawn, I'm seeing him tomorrow night.

SHAWN:
Really? Wow, that's so fast on the rescheduling. It's... No conflicts either way? Huh?

JULIET:
Yeah, we'll see. Well, I should go. (starts for door)

SHAWN:
Hey, uh, have you eaten?

JULIET:
(walks back) No.

SHAWN:
Well, I can't offer anything as fancy as Mario's. But.. What you think of a Ball Park and a stroll on the boardwalk? It is golden time. I've been told, I, uh, look pretty good in that lighting.

JULIET:
Really?

SHAWN:
It's true.

JULIET:
Is that right?

SHAWN presses a button on a remote on the table next to him. With a soft whir, a small device carries two hot dogs down on a zipline. JULIET chuckles.

SHAWN:
(picks up hot dog) They plump when you cook them.

JULIET:
(picks up the other) They plump?

SHAWN:
(hits button a carrier goes back) Literally.

SHAWN and JULIET walk to the door.

SHAWN:
As the temperature rises, the wiener absorbs all additional moisture. Causing it to double. Sometimes even triple in diameter.

JULIET:
Triple? Wow.

They exit together.

Episode 3x09 Christmas Joy

1987

INT. SPENCER HOUSE, DAY

It's Christmas morning and SHAWN runs down the stairs, excited to open his presents. HENRY is in a corner of the living room putting together a bicycle. He tries to hide it from SHAWN.

HENRY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's barely morning, just hold up. I know you're excited, your adrenaline is rushing and your heart rate is pumping, just like you got a big case and this is hot crime scene.

SHAWN:
Dad, I just want to see what Santa brought me.

HENRY:
And you will soon enough. But first, I want you to recreate everything that went done here last night. (sits on couch)

SHAWN looks around the room and sees footprints going from the fireplace to the couch. They then go to the tree and then the window.

SHAWN:
Santa came in, sat down, ate milk and cookies, put the presents under the tree, then something spooked him and he ran out.

HENRY:
That's right. Maybe you woke up a little earlier than he thought. It's a pity, too, because he didn't get a chance to finish putting together your brand new bicycle.

SHAWN smiles and hurries over to the bike. The seat comes off in his hand and he turns to face HENRY.

HENRY:
Merry Christmas, Shawn.

PRESENT DAY

INT, PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN is carrying a box of Christmas decorations. There are already some up in the office, as well as a tree. GUS is sitting at his desk.

GUS:
What took you so long? You know I have to get to my mom and dad's.

SHAWN:
Choosing the perfect holiday gift takes time, Gus. (pulls out portrait from Monarch lodge) You can't cut corners. You have to customize, match the gift with the individual. (pineapple with ribbon) Look, I took our Halloween decorations and put Santa hats on them. What do you think? (holds up pumpkins and the eyes glow red)

GUS:
Look, can we do this later? (stands) My sister Joy's flight gets in any minute now.

SHAWN:
You have plenty of time.

GUS:
No I don't, Shawn. You know she usually works during the holidays, London, Paris, Hong Kong. Now that she's home, we have to spend as much time together as possible.

SHAWN:
All that time away from home for work, precisely why I didn't go to law school.

GUS:
Yeah, that and the school part.

They hear the door close and turn to see a young GIRL enter.

SHAWN:
Well, hello there. May I help you?

GIRL:
Are you Mr. Psych?

SHAWN and GUS laugh.

SHAWN:
I'm Mr. Shawn, and this is Scrooge Jones. We're psychic detectives. Who might you be?

GIRL:
My name's Brittany. Mr. Shawn, I need to hire you.

SHAWN:
I see. What for?

BRITTANY:
To get Santa out of jail. All I have is $1.38. (holds out handful of coins) I hope it's enough.

GUS:
We couldn't possibly accept that.

SHAWN:
He's right. (whispers) What else do you have?

GUS hits him on the back with his elbow.

BRITTANY:
The policemen dragged him away from the Santa's village in Solvang. Please. You have to help him.

SHAWN:
Don't worry, Brittany. There are some wonderful public defenders in the North Pole. Santa will be out in no time.

BRITTANY:
But if he's not out by Christmas eve, he can't deliver his toys.

SHAWN:
Uh, this is...

GUS:
This is a matter for the police.

SHAWN:
Yes, and we never interfere with police matters.

BRITTANY:
I understand.

SHAWN:
(laughing) Okay.

GUS:
Good.

BRITTANY starts crying, face scrunches up and tears falling down her cheeks. The guys stop smiling.

SHAWN:
Oh, boy. What are you supposed to do when a child's crying like this?

GUS is sympathy crying.

GUS:
You cave. Brittany, Mr. Shawn and I will get Santa out as soon as we get back.

BRITTANY:
(smiles) Thank you, Scrooge Jones. Thank you, Mr. Shawn. (leaves)

GUS:
Let's go.

INT. GUSTERS' HOUSE, FRONT HALL, DAY

BILL and WINNIE arrive home with JOY. BILL carries in her bags and WINNIE calls ahead.

WINNIE:
Gus! Gus, we're back from the airport.

GUS comes running around a corner to greet them.

GUS:
(laughs) Hey, sis!

JOY:
Aw, Gussie!

They hug.

GUS:
I missed you.

JOY:
I missed you, too.

They end their hug. SHAWN has joined them in the front hall.

GUS:
You don't know what it's been like not having anyone to talk to.

JOY:
Well, I want to hear more about this psychic detective agency.

WINNIE:
It's very impressive.

SHAWN mouths "thank you".

BILL:
As we found out last year when we were both brought up on murder charges.

JOY:
I still find that hard to believe.

WINNIE:
Well, we were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

BILL:
Nobody to blame.

BILL and WINNIE point fingers at each other.

JOY:
You two must be pretty good. It's funny, I don't remember you being psychic.

SHAWN:
Oh.

JOY:
When did this happen?

SHAWN and GUS exchange a look before answering together.

BOTH:
High School.

JOY:
Did you two just look at each other?

They look again.

BOTH:
No.

JOY:
You just did it again as if to corroborate what you are going to say.

SHAWN and GUS get defensive, their voices overlapping.

SHAWN:
(crosses one arm across his body and holds the other out) Joy, what is this?

GUS:
(holds hands out in a shrug) I mean...

SHAWN:
We're not on trial here.

GUS:
Joy...

SHAWN:
It's Christmastime...

GUS:
You came through the door and it's like "what?"

SHAWN:
Be merry! This is not a court room.

GUS:
It's not about law.

JOY:
So why are you both striking defensive poses?

They both lower their arms.

SHAWN:
(stutters) I was just, I was keeping it loose.

GUS:
(rests arm on SHAWN'S shoulder) Yeah.

BILL:
(checks watch) Um, I'm going to be late to work. And don't forget, I'm covering the night shift.

WINNIE:
No, Joy just got here. Raytheon can wait.

BILL:
Government planes don't make themselves... yet.

JOY:
It's okay, daddy. It'll give me and Gus a chance to catch up.

BILL:
All right, well, I'll see you in the morning, then. Okay, bye.

BILL kisses WINNIE and JOY goodbye before leaving.

WINNIE:
Sweetheart, your room's all ready, and I'll just be a little longer in the kitchen. (leaves)

GUS:
Let me get this up to your room for you. (strains to left her bags) I doubt you need all of them. (takes the smallest and goes upstairs)

JOY:
(laughs) You can get them later.

JOY and SHAWN watch GUS as he goes upstairs. SHAWN sighs and looks at JOY. They then start kissing passionately.

INT. GUSTERS' HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

SHAWN and JOY are making out on the couch. SHAWN pulls away.

SHAWN:
No, wait a minute. What are we doing? What are we doing? This... This cannot happen.

JOY:
I know.

SHAWN:
It was a one-time fling ten years ago, and that's it.

JOY:
I never told.

SHAWN:
Well, thank God. Gus would be crushed.

JOY:
We're both adults, okay?

SHAWN:
No, that's where you're wrong. We're not adults. You're Gus' big sister with the tassels on the handlebars of your banana-seat bike. And I'm Gus' best friend, who put a frog on top of your head. Listen, listen, we can't fool around, especially not in your living room. For Gus' sake, we have to fight it.

JOY:
Speak for yourself. (starts kissing him)

They break apart and stand when they hear GUS coming down the stairs.

GUS:
You know, Joy, since you're so interested in Psych, you should spend as much time with me and Shawn as possible.

JOY:
Great!

SHAWN looks at JOY before plastering on a fake smile.

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

SHAWN, GUS and JOY enter the station. As GUS expounds on what they do, JOY tries to hold SHAWN'S hand and he keeps evading.

GUS:
This is where we do our thing, where it all goes down, where the magic happens.

SHAWN:
You realize you repeat yourself when you're trying to impress someone?

GUS:
Yeah, right. Whatever. Please.

JOY:
You kind of do.

SHAWN:
Told you so. Touch√©.

GUS:
You can't touch√© yourself.

SHAWN:
Sure I can. Your bad.

GUS:
It's not my bad. You can't "my bad" for someone else.

SHAWN:
Yeah, but you ain't mad at it, though. Know what you saying'?

GUS:
Will you stop it?

VICK:
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster, I don't remember hiring you for a case.

SHAWN:
Oh, we're here researching a case for uh, another client. Detective O'Hara's expecting us.

VICK:
All three of you?

GUS:
Oh, this is my sister, Joy. She's our guest.

JOY:
Hi.

JOY and VICK shake hands.

VICK:
Um, well, technically, you are guests, so that doesn't give you the right to bring your own.

GUS:
I'm sorry, Chief. Joy was just excited to see what we do.

VICK:
Have you ever seen a movie about high school?

JOY:
Yes.

VICK:
Then you've pretty much seen what they do.

SHAWN:
(chuckles weakly) Oh, Chief, she's just a joker.

VICK:
Sorry, no visitors beyond this point.

GUS:
Oh, yeah sure.

VICK enters her office.

GUS:
(to JOY) Wait here just a moment.

SHAWN and GUS go over to JULIET who is passing out files.

SHAWN:
Jules, wait up.

JULIET:
Hey, oh, I'm sorry, I got your message. Things have just been really hectic around here. Something about the holidays.

SHAWN:
(puts hand to head) Speaking of which, I'm sensing the Santa we've been looking for probably would've been brought in this morning. (lowers hand)

JULIET:
Must've been that fight down at Santa's Village in Solvang we got a call about. Yeah, we sent a paddy wagon down to assist the county.

SHAWN:
Where are they now?

JULIET:
Well unfortunately, some poor guy was knocked unconscious during the fight, so we're holding everyone in a holding cell until we can find out who's going to face assault charges. This way.

INT. SBPD, HOLDING, DAY

JULIET leads them downstairs and to the cells.

JULIET:
And here we are.

Standing at the bars is a man who really looks like Santa with white hair and beard and dressed in a long-sleeve red shirt with suspenders.

SHAWN:
He really does look like Santa.

JULIET:
Excuse me, sir, could you please step out of the way?

"Santa" moves out of the way to reveal a MAN sitting on one of the benches, his head resting on the wall, one foot on the bench, one on the floor. He looks more like a bum than Santa.

JULIET:
That's your Santa.

SHAWN:
Of course, it is.

JULIET:
Let me know if you need anything else. (leaves)

SHAWN studies the man and sees a large bruise on his left arm around his elbow and others on his right arm. He then studies the other men in the cell. One has a red bracelet with Hebrew on it.

SHAWN:
(aside to GUS) Dude, our Santa only has defensive wounds. There's no way he put anybody in a coma. And I can tell from that guy's bracelet that he's a master of Krav Maga. His fists are considered deadly weapons.

GUS:
Since when can you read Hebrew?

SHAWN:
Since I spent a summer working at a Hasidic deli. Those were good times. (chuckles) Shlomo. Jules, (hand to head) I'm getting something here.

JULIET walks over.

SHAWN:
(moves his hands like he's doing martial arts) I'm seeing hands, fast as lighting. It's more than a little exciting.

GUS:
Kung fu fighting.

SHAWN:
That's right. Someone in the fight was a master of martial arts, but not Santa.

GUS:
He brings peace and Joy.

SHAWN:
That's right, Gus. The man I'm thinking of is a lethal machine, trained in the martial arts of the Middle East. Hoy! That's him! (points) He's the one who knocked the victim unconscious, and he's the one that should serve time for assault with a deadly weapon.

MAN:
(stands) Assault?! (walks up to bars) I was minding my own business. I only hit that guy because I was defending Santa.

JULIET:
Nice job, Shawn. You just saved us hours of processing.

SHAWN:
Well consider it your Christmas gift.

JULIET:
(to officer) Take him to the interrogation room, please.

SHAWN:
And make sure this one gets back to Santa's Village to spread some Christmas cheer. There's a very sweet little girl counting on it.

GUS:
We just saved Christmas.

SHAWN:
What?

They fist-bump and then do the dances from "A Charlie Brown Christmas".

INT. SBPD, HALL, DAY

LASSITER is sitting next to JOY on a bench.

LASSITER:
So, when the cluster of bullets is very tight, we refer to that as precision, not to be confused with accuracy which has to do with the proximity to the intended target.

SHAWN and GUS arrive. GUS does not look pleased.

GUS:
What's going on here?

LASSITER:
Just having a conversation with your delightful sister.

JOY takes advantage of their arrival to stand.

GUS:
Really?

LASSITER stands to help her with her purse.

LASSITER:
Oh, let me get that for you.

GUS:
"Get that for you. " I know exactly what that means. Shawn, what is the sentence for assaulting a police officer?

SHAWN:
Whoa! It's okay, buddy. Sorry, Gus is a little overprotective of his older sister.

GUS:
What's the deal with you and people's sisters anyway? First Vick's and now mine? And aren't you still married?

GUS:
You snow white...

SHAWN:
Lassie, I think Dobson is, uh, calling for you.

LASSITER:
(to JOY) Really nice to meet you. (leaves)

JOY looks at GUS as if to say "what was that all about?".

GUS:
(watches LASSITER walk away) The nerve of some people.

JOY:
You know, Gus, hey! I'm a big girl, and I can see whoever I want, thank you.

GUS:
No, not if that person's supposed to be a friend of mine, uh-uh. Hell no. (walks off)

SHAWN and JOY look at each other and SHAWN smiles nervously.

EXT. SBPD, DAY

SHAWN and JOY walk down the stairs. SHAWN is on the phone.

SHAWN:
Yeah, well you weren't there to see it's little face looking up at me meowing for milk and warmth and shelter, were you, Garth? Fine, thanks. (ends call and join GUS) Apparently, my apartment is infested with fleas. It may or may not have something to do with the stray cat that I took in, but they cannot blame me for infesting the entire building.

BOTH:
One adult female flea lays thousands of eggs.

SHAWN:
Wow. That's a little bit frightening. I'll need some place to crash while they fumigate. I'd stay at my dad's, but he's got some of his lodge buddies in town.

JOY:
Well, Gus and I are staying with our folks for the holidays. Why don't you stay with us? (smiles)

SHAWN:
Oh, I don't know, Joy...

GUS:
Shawn, please.

JOY:
There, it's settled.

GUS turns to look at JOY but stops when he sees BRITTANY and the man they got from the holding cell.

GUS:
Look.

SHAWN:
What is it?

BRITTANY:
I saved your butt this time, Daddy! You're lucky I didn't leave you in there to rot!

SHAWN watches and shakes his head as BRITTANY gets into the car and her father shuts the door.

BRITTANY:
Now we only have three days left! Don't screw up again!

FATHER:
Jeez, I'm sorry. (walks to driver's side)

GUS:
She's a little con artist.

SHAWN:
I bet she had more than $1.38 on her, too.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are with JULIET at her desk.

SHAWN:
Dude, we got conned on Christmas. I don't like having my emotions toyed with like that.

JULIET:
Well, we ran fingerprints on everyone. His name was Carl Wilcox, and, according to police records, he is a known con man.

SHAWN recalls BRITTANY saying they only have three days left.

SHAWN:
Whatever it is, they must be planning it for the 24th. We just need to get proof. Thank you, Jules.

SHAWN and GUS leave.

JULIET:
(calls after them) You're welcome.

EXT. SANTA'S VILLAGE, COURTYARD DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk through the main gates and into the courtyard. Among the typical displays is a pen with two reindeer.

SHAWN:
(points at reindeer) What?

GUS:
What?

They see people dressed as elves, large gingerbread men and a life-size manger scene.

SANTA:
Ho, ho, ho! Have you been good this year?

SHAWN and GUS see SANTA with a child on his lap and then look to where elves are selling the photos taken of the children.

ELF:
All right, so that will be 20 wallets and one 8 x 10. We can send it to a home address. Just check the box.

They make their way forward so they're even with the front of the line.

SANTA:
(to girl) Okay, well, you keep those grades up so that we can give you everything on your list, okay? All right.

SANTA sets the little girl back down and an elf takes her back to her mother.

SANTA:
Who's next in line to see Santa?

SHAWN and GUS cut the line.

SHAWN:
Excuse us.

SANTA:
(laughs) I don't think Santa's lap is big enough for you boys.

SHAWN:
Cut the crap, Carl. We know you conned us into getting you out of jail.

CARL:
(stands) Okay, not here, all right? (to line) Santa's going to take a five. Be right back.

CARL leads SHAWN and GUS to a side alley. BRITTANY is there playing a video game.

SHAWN:
Hey, what blind kid did you steal that from?

BRITTANY:
Why would a blind kid have a video game?

SHAWN:
(pauses) You have cooties on your face.

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
She started it.

GUS:
You started it.

SHAWN:
She gave me the stink eye.

GUS:
She was playing a video game.

SHAWN:
She's a little...

GUS:
Shawn!

CARL:
Okay, look, guys, I really appreciate you getting me out of jail. But I'm working here, okay? Why don't you come back when we have a little reindeer lunch break?

GUS:
Or maybe you'd like to tell us about that little con you have planned for the 24th.

SHAWN:
Here's the thing, Carl, we're on to you. (looks at BRITTANY) Both of you.

CARL:
(stands right in front of them) Couple of smart guys, huh? Well, you're too smart for your own good.

GUS:
(to SHAWN) This guy.

CARL:
(shouts and cowers) Don't hit me!

He runs out to the courtyard followed by SHAWN, GUS and BRITTANY.

GUS:
Whoa! Whoa! Slow down, Santa!

SHAWN and GUS grab CARL in front of a crowd of children.

SHAWN:
Not so fast, St. Nick, huh? International sign of guilt, buddy.

BRITTANY starts crying.

MAN:
Look at those guys!

MAN 2:
Hey, those were the same two guys who I saw cut in line.

WOMAN:
They don't even have kids.

SHAWN:
This is not good.

GUS:
No.

A security GUARD takes them both by the arm and CARL hugs BRITTANY.

GUARD:
All right, enough of you two. Let's go.

As they are lead away, SHAWN sees the lists of families getting photos on the laptop monitor.

INT. GUSTERS' HOUSE, FRONT HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS hurry up the front stairs.

GUS:
I've never been kicked out of Santa's Village before, Shawn.

SHAWN:
You're gonna get used to it.

GUS:
I don't want to get used to it. It's humiliating.

INT. GUSTERS' HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN:
We still don't know what crime Carl and Brittany are planning for Christmas Eve.

JOY steps out of the bathroom dressed in a short nightgown.

JOY:
Good night, guys.

GUS:
Good night.

SHAWN:
'Night, Joy. See you in the morning.

He waves as she enters her bedroom and closes the door.

SHAWN:
It's like they're mocking us, you know. Feels like a slap in the face. And not a Rhett Butler slap, an Ike Turner slap.

GUS:
Mmmm.

SHAWN:
But we still have a few days to figure it out. Let's just go to bed.

GUS:
Cool.

The two fist-bump and head to their rooms. SHAWN is next to the bathroom and GUS is across the hall next to JOY'S.

GUS:
Good night, dude.

SHAWN:
'Night.

Both men enter their respective rooms.

INT. GUSTERS' HOUSE, SHAWN'S ROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN is lying in bed attempting to read.

SHAWN:
This is ridiculous.

He gets out of bed and leaves the room.

INT. GUSTERS' HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN tiptoes down to JOY'S room but hesitates outside her door. He changes his mind and goes into the bathroom instead. JOY then slips out of her room and heads down to SHAWN'S, pausing to primp before going in. SHAWN comes out of the bathroom and makes his way to his bedroom before turning and going into JOY'S room. GUS steps out and looks down the hall towards the stairs. JOY comes out of SHAWN'S room but ducks back in before GUS sees her. GUS turns around at the sound of the door closing and SHAWN comes out of JOY'S room. He sees GUS and goes back in. GUS goes back into his room. JOY leaves SHAWN'S room and goes into the bathroom. SHAWN leaves JOY'S room and goes back to his, somewhat dejected. JOY goes back to her room. SHAWN steps out when he hears her door and goes down to the end of the hall.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Joy!

INT. GUSTERS' HOUSE, FRONT HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN goes down the stairs.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Joy!

SHAWN notices that the basement door is open. As he slips inside, he notices that one of the kings in the manger scene is black.

INT. GUSTERS' HOUSE, BASEMENT, NIGHT

SHAWN opens the door to a large storage area.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Joy! Joy!

SHAWN is looking around as the door opens behind him and the light is switched on. It's BILL. They both gasp in surprise. We see a mall living area set up with a TV and chairs.

BILL:
Shawn?

SHAWN:
Mr. Guster?

BILL:
You're supposed to be asleep. What are you doing here?

SHAWN:
I-I thought that I heard a noise or something. You're supposed to be working the night shift. What are you doing home?

BILL:
I- I forgot something.

SHAWN:
Oh! So, I guess you'll be going back to work then.

BILL:
And I guess you, you'll be going back to sleep?

They circle each other.

SHAWN:
Why aren't you leaving?

BILL:
It's my house. I can leave when I want to! You want to tell me what you were looking for down here?

SHAWN sees residue on BILL'S lapel.

SHAWN:
(puts hand to head) Whoa, I'm getting something here. You weren't at work like you said you were. I see a projector, a movie projector.

BILL:
You're not going to be reading me.

SHAWN:
Yes.

BILL:
Uh-uh. No, no. (ducks and dodges like a boxer)

SHAWN:
Oh, Mister, please...

BILL:
No, no.

SHAWN:
That's ridiculous.

BILL:
No, stick and move. Stick and move.

SHAWN:
Sir, please don't do that. I've already had the vision. It's over. The vision is over. I've had it. It's done.

BILL stops and breathes heavily.

SHAWN:
You lied to your family about working the night shift.

BILL:
The truth is... I lost my job at Raytheon a month ago.

SHAWN:
Oh, I'm sorry.

BILL sighs.

SHAWN:
Why are you keeping it a secret?

BILL:
It's Christmastime. Joy's home. I didn't want everybody to worry. So, I go out on interviews all through the day and hang out at the movies or a coffee shop at night. My family thinks I'm doing my night shift. And this is between me and you and that lamp over there, all right?

SHAWN:
You're saying the lawn chair isn't trustworthy?

BILL:
Oh, be serious, boy! So, we're cool, right?

SHAWN:
We're cool, Mr. G. Yeah.

BILL:
I would hate to think that things changed because you betrayed my trust.

SHAWN:
(scoffs) Believe me, you don't have to worry about that. (leaves)

INT, PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN is lying back in his desk chair, tired from little sleep.

GUS:
(pacing) The problem is, Carl already knows we're on to him. He's not going to let us get close enough to figure out what he's up to.

SHAWN:
(yawns) Unless...

JOY:
You guys ready to grab lunch?

SHAWN and GUS look at JOY as she enters the office. SHAWN waves.

GUS:
Good idea. You could use a pick-me-up.

SHAWN:
I'm sorry, man. I just, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Um, unless, of course, we could figure out a way to snoop around Santa's Village without Carl knowing.

GUS:
How are we going to do that?

JOY:
I can help.

EXT. SANTA'S VILLAGE, COURTYARD DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk over to the office just as JOY, in an elf costume, exits with a MANAGER.

MANAGER:
Welcome aboard.

JOY:
Thank you.

MANAGER:
We can use all the help we can get for the Christmas rush.

The MANAGER has an open file with CARL'S application. SHAWN reads it over her shoulder. Under "References" he sees the name Theodore and immediately remembers the name of the security guard was Ted. The MANAGER spots SHAWN and closes the file.

JOY:
Merry Christmas!

MANAGER:
Merry Christmas. (goes inside)

SHAWN:
(claps) Great job.

JOY:
Thank you.

SHAWN:
Make sure you sign up for Carl's shift.

JOY:
Okay.

GUS:
Stay close to him. Let us know what you find out. We'll pick you up later.

JOY:
I'm on it.

JOY walks away and SHAWN watches just a smidge too long for GUS' liking.

GUS:
What the heck are you looking at?

SHAWN:
That is a beautiful wreath.

GUS:
I hear that.

EXT. SANTA'S VILLAGE, GATES, NIGHT

JOY comes through the main entrance and meets SHAWN and GUS.

SHAWN:
(claps) So? Did Carl realize you were checking up on him?

JOY:
He didn't suspect a thing.

GUS:
What did you find out?

JOY:
I'm sorry, guys, but Carl seems like he's on the up and up.

GUS:
You didn't see him talking with any shady characters?

JOY:
No, just the kids. And you know what? He's a pretty good Santa. I mean, he just doesn't ask them what they want, he asks the kids what they like most about Christmas, what they're most thankful for, what relatives they're going to visit. It's quite touching.

SHAWN remembers one of the elves asking for an address to mail the photos to.

SHAWN:
Wait a minute, that's it. (puts hands to head)

GUS:
What? What do you see?

JOY:
Are you having a vision?

SHAWN:
(stutters) It's a small, it's a small, it's just a... tiny vision.

JOY makes an appreciative "ooh" that comes out rather sultry.

SHAWN:
(closes eyes) Cold shower, baseball stats, watching my grandmother eat meatloaf.

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
I see Carl and Ted standing in front of a computer screen, uh, with a list of addresses, getting the information from the kids about who's traveling over the holidays, gives them a built-in list of empty houses to rob. That's why he had to be out of jail on Christmas Eve.

We see the action unfold as SHAWN speaks.

GUS:
We need to warn the police before tomorrow.

JOY hurries off and SHAWN watches her go.

GUS:
What the heck are you looking at?

SHAWN:
(laughs) That... Look how cute that little snowman is.

GUS:
I hear that.

GUS walks away and SHAWN follows. The look on his face says "Thank God, he bought that".

EXT. SANTA'S VILLAGE, COURTYARD, NIGHT

JULIET and LASSITER have joined them as they enter the courtyard.

SHAWN:
His car's still here, so where's Carl?

LASSITER turns on his flashlight and casts a beam around the area.

SHAWN:
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse, much less a robber. Really? No one is here? Not a single person? Hello?

LASSITER:
(turns off flashlight) Great. Thanks for dragging us out here for nothing, Spencer.

JULIET:
You're sure you sensed something was going to happen tonight?

SHAWN:
Maybe we just missed them. We could try and figure out which houses they were planning on robbing.

LASSITER:
What do you doing, just randomly start knocking on doors? We've got better things to do. Come on, O'Hara.

LASSITER and JULIET turn around and head back out.

JOY:
How often are you wrong like this?

SHAWN:
Not often.

GUS:
(whispers) Often.

GUS turns on his flashlight and aims it at the manger scene.

GUS:
As usual, they neglected to make one of the wise men black.

JOY:
And I thought everyone knew about Balthazar.

SHAWN remembers one of the kings being black earlier. He goes over and the others follow. He walks up to the king in question and pokes it in the side of the face. It falls to the ground, and they all scream. JULIET and LASSITER hurry back, guns drawn. SHAWN kneels by the body.

SHAWN:
It's Ted.

JULIET hurries over and feels the neck for a pulse. She and SHAWN both straighten up.

JULIET:
We're not dealing with con artists. We're dealing with murderers.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, DAY

SHAWN and GUS enter the office. VICK is sitting behind her desk and LASSITER is on one of the chairs facing it.

VICK:
Thank you for coming, Mr. Spencer. Now that this has become a murder case, we're amping up the investigation. As you can imagine, the city wants people to feel safe this holiday season.

LASSITER:
We brought Carl into custody this morning. Brittany's in the conference room with Child Protective Services. So far, we haven't found anything to link Carl to the murder, so technically, we can only charge him with conspiracy to commit burglary. But we're willing to recommend that the D.A. cut a deal if he cooperates in the murder investigation.

GUS:
Did he take it?

LASSITER:
He says he'll only talk to you guys.

VICK:
So, I need to know what you can get out of him. Let's close the book on this one, pronto.

SHAWN and GUS leave the office.

SBPD, INTEROGATION, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are sitting at the table while CARL, still in costume, paces. An officer is present, standing against a wall.

CARL:
I... I admit it, the Santa job was just a long con to rob some people, okay? But you got to believe me, I...I could never have killed Ted.

SHAWN:
I know. Ted was your inside man.

CARL:
(stops and points at SHAWN) I kept that from the police. (paces) Ted and I were partners for a long time. We scammed people all up and down the coast, but we were just con men. We never physically hurt anybody. That wasn't our thing. (sits across from them) Listen, whoever it was that killed Ted might be coming after me next, or, even worse, after Brittany. I don't trust the cops to protect us. You got to stop them.

SHAWN:
How can we believe anything you say, Carl?

GUS:
Fool us once, shame on you. Fool us twice, shame on us.

SHAWN:
Fool us thrice makes an ass out of "u" and "me".

GUS:
Nope.

SHAWN:
We're soon parted?

GUS:
That's a fool and his money.

SHAWN:
What a fool believes?

GUS:
Shawn.

CARL:
(yells) Look, if they kill me, they're just going to throw Brittany back in the system. Now she's a tough little girl, but she's already been through a lot, all right? And I'm all she's got.

SHAWN:
Sorry, man. We don't trust you as far as Gus can throw you.

CARL'S lip begins to quiver and he starts crying.

SHAWN:
Well, now we know where Brittany got this little trick.

CARL'S crying gets more intense and GUS fights crying himself.

SHAWN:
Oh, dude, I think he's really crying.

GUS:
Shawn, you know I can't handle it when a grown man cries. I'm a sympathetic crier.

SHAWN:
What?

GUS gives in and soon both men are sobbing.

SHAWN:
I... Okay, fine! Fine. We'll see what we can do, but you have to promise to cooperate fully. Otherwise, we'll have you dragged right back in here for this Christmas con.

CARL:
Deal. Thank you.

SHAWN:
(to GUS) Stop it. (to CARL) Do you know who may have wanted to hurt you or Ted?

CARL:
We might've kind of owed someone a little money.

SHAWN:
How about you be a little bit more specific?

CARL:
We were into our bookie for ten grand. That's why we were going to do the robberies.

GUS:
(tearfully) Do you know where we can find this bookie?

CARL:
Frank works at two bars, O'Neil's and The Wild Ox.

SHAWN:
Sweet.

SHAWN and GUS stand. SHAWN sighs and whispers to GUS.

SHAWN:
We'll have to split up. You in the mood for Hepatitis A or C?

They leave.

INT. O'NEIL'S BAR, NIGHT

SHAWN walks up to the bartender.

SHAWN:
Excuse me. Where's Frank?

The bartender nods and SHAWN turns around to see a man working at one of the booths. He goes over and sits down with a sigh and a brief look at a moving Santa statue.

SHAWN:
All right, get me $10 on Do Not Resuscitate in the fifth race. I don't have any cash but give me your PayPal account, and I'll make a secure deposit online.

FRANK:
(crushes cigarette in ashtray) Some kind of joke?

SHAWN:
Maybe I should introduce myself. Shawn Spencer, psychic detective. I'm here to talk to you about a couple of your customers, namely Carl and Ted.

FRANK:
Well, I hope it's about those two bums paying me the money they owe me.

SHAWN:
It's going to be tough for Ted to pay you back, seeing as how he's dead and everything.

FRANK:
When did this happen?

SHAWN:
(scoffs) Last night. As if you didn't already know. Come on, Frank, I know the game. Somebody loses big, they can't come up with the cash, you got to send a little message. Isn't that the code?

FRANK:
There's a bigger code than that. Dead men don't pay back debts. Injured men do. So, I'm not your guy. Besides, there's a bar room full of witnesses that can vouch for my whereabouts last night. Now, if you'll excuse me, a paying customer has just arrived.

SHAWN:
Fine. (points at Santa) That's weird.

SHAWN gets up to leave and nearly bumps into WINNIE.

SHAWN:
Mrs. G?

WINNIE gasps.

SHAWN:
What in the world are you doing here? Do you know what this guy does?

WINNIE:
Oh, this is so embarrassing. Um, Shawn... (clears throat) I've recently made the first and the only bet in my life.

SHAWN:
But you're Gus' mom, for goodness sakes.

WINNIE:
I know. I know. And normally gambling isn't something that I would approve of, but Susan in accounting has this cousin, Jeff, nice guy. He knows someone who knows someone who knows Frank. I already told you this, Frank.

FRANK:
(doing paperwork) I wasn't listening.

WINNIE:
Anyway, it all seemed like fate at the time until I lost. Oh, oh, I felt terrible and I learned a valuable lesson about the perils of gambling. Long story short, I... I lost my Christmas money.

WINNIE gives FRANK the envelope of money.

WINNIE:
Shawn, you have to promise not to tell my husband. I don't want him to know about my secret vice.

SHAWN:
Oh, Mrs. G. First of all, one time is not a vice. It was a momentary lapse in judgment, maybe a jones. Secondly, I am psychically detecting that Mr. Guster will not be angry with you for keeping a secret from the family. He'll understand.

INT. GUSTER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, DAY

The four family members are sitting around the coffee table eating when SHAWN comes in.

SHAWN:
(yawns) What are you guys doing up? It's barely light outside.

WINNIE:
Have a seat, dear.

WINNIE tosses SHAWN a cushion and he sits on the floor like GUS and JOY.

SHAWN:
Wow! Christmas at my house never starts 'til after the football game.

GUS:
Well, you're just in time to open presents.

GUS gets up and walks to the fireplace while JOY hands SHAWN a gift.

GUS:
(hand in stocking) Gee, I wonder if Santa put money in our stockings even though he knows we don't need it.

JOY checks her stocking as well. BILL and WINNIE look guilty on the couch.

GUS:
Hey, where's my Christmas money? I was looking forward to that.

JOY checks the other stockings.

BILL:
I thought you had this handled. With me working the night shift, I didn't have time...

WINNIE:
I have been cooking, cleaning, getting the house ready. I've been swamped. (looks at SHAWN) I'm not going to lie. Honey, I made a horrible mistake. I know how you feel about gambling, there's no place for it in the Guster house, but I placed a bet with a bookie and I lost all my spending money.

JOY and GUS stop their search and hear everything.

BILL:
(stands) Oh, Winnie!

GUS:
Mom!

JOY:
You know how to find a bookie?

WINNIE:
(stands) I am sorry. I am so, so sorry. Please forgive me.

BILL:
Winnie Guster placed a bet.

BILL, GUS and JOY start laughing and SHAWN joins in.

SHAWN:
(claps) She...

BILL:
Oh honey, of course we forgive you. Come here. (hugs her) In fact, you've inspired me to come clean about something, too. (clears throat) I, uh... I got laid off from my job a month ago. And before you all start worrying, it's okay. I've already got a couple of call backs for some interviews. I just couldn't bring myself to admit it to you guys.

JOY:
Oh, Daddy. You know you could've come to us.

GUS:
(walks over) Yeah, I mean, layoffs are common in this economy. We understand.

WINNIE:
Oh sweetheart, you'll always be a good provider.

GUS:
Yeah.

BILL:
Thank you.

They have a family hug and SHAWN tries to get out of the way.

WINNIE:
Hey! Hey you, down there. You deserve some of this.

SHAWN:
Oh, no.

WINNIE:
Oh, yes. It was Shawn who helped me realize that I could trust you guys with the truth.

BILL:
Yes, he was there when I needed him, too. Come on up here, boy.

SHAWN:
Oh. Oh, okay.

GUS helps him stand.

WINNIE:
Group hug.

SHAWN is pulled into the hug. JOY ends the hug.

JOY:
I have something to confess, too. Well, actually, Shawn and I do.

SHAWN:
No, we don't.

JOY:
Yes, we do.

SHAWN:
No, we don't. Please, no.

JOY:
We had a romantic tryst ten years ago. Just a little something something.

GUS looks at SHAWN.

JOY:
But with everyone's blessing, we would like to pick up where we left off.

GUS:
You fooled around with my sister?

SHAWN:
Please don't say fooled around. That makes it sound so dirty. One time. Ten years ago. You were off at college.

GUS:
Just because I'm not here, doesn't make her not my sister!

BILL:
(hands on hips) Or our baby girl.

JOY:
Point of information, I'm not a baby.

GUS, BILL and WINNIE turn and shush JOY.

JOY:
What happened to all the love and forgiveness from just a second ago?

WINNIE:
Oh, my mistake wasn't this bad.

BILL:
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you implying that my mistake was worse than yours? Because yours was a lot worse.

WINNIE:
Excuse me, I have a job.

BILL:
I knew it! I knew it was coming.

WINNIE:
Who loses a job after 35 years?

BILL:
You see? That's why you lost all your little money. God don't like ugly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. (leaves)

WINNIE:
(laughs) Oh, no he didn't. Oh, no he did not. (leaves)

GUS:
Wait, wait a second. I'm the one that should be upset here. Everyone in here was lying to me.

JOY:
Grow up! I can't see who I want because you can't handle it.

GUS:
You fooled around with my best friend. You'll do whatever you can just to be the center of attention, won't you?

JOY:
Forehead!

GUS:
Ears!

JOY puts her hands over her ears and hurries from the room.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I'm so sorry, man.

GUS:
Goodbye, Shawn.

GUS leaves the room, going in a different direction from everyone else.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, NIGHT

HENRY grabs a serving tray off a table as he heads into the room.

HENRY:
Yeah, yeah, shrimp. I got it. I'm coming, I'm coming.

HENRY walks into the room proper just as SHAWN enters through the back door.

SHAWN:
Hey Dad, merry Christmas.

HENRY:
Hey Shawn, I thought you were staying over at the Gusters. (replenishes shrimp)

SHAWN:
Yeah, well I kind of, sort of ruined Christmas at that house.

HENRY:
(laughs) What'd you do this time?

SHAWN:
Gus' sister and I sort of hooked up a while back, and for some unknown reason she announced it to the whole family, and now Gus is pissed and he's kicking people out.

HENRY:
Yeah, well fooling around with your best friend's sister certainly wasn't your most brilliant idea.

SHAWN:
No, that was the toaster alarm I invented in the third grade, that woke you up by smacking you in the face with a waffle. I think I peaked too soon.

HENRY:
All right, look, Shawn, of course Gus is going to overreact. He's more than just your friend, he's your partner. There's a special kind of trust there. When you find out that you've been lied to by your partner, you get angry. I saw it on the force all the time.

SHAWN remembers when CARL says they used to run cons along the coast.

SHAWN:
Dad, that's it. That's it! I bet Carl and Ted have another partner.

HENRY:
What? Carl and Ted? How many relatives do the Gusters have?

SHAWN:
(grabs a shrimp) I gotta go! I have a break in the case! (runs out)

HENRY:
Wait... Merry Christmas.

Episode 3x10 Six Feet Under the Sea

1987

EXT. AQUARIUM, ENTRANCE, DAY

Grade school children are exiting a school bus and heading for the entrance. A teacher is checking them off a list on a clipboard.

TEACHER:
34, 35. Okay, that's everybody. Okay, first stop is the touch pool. Let's line up at the dolphin gate. Oh, stay with your buddy. Make sure you watch your step as you enter the aquarium. (follows children)

With the teacher gone, GUS and SHAWN peer out a bus window.

SHAWN:
We did it, Gus. A year of planning's finally paid off.

GUS:
Don't you think we should wait until they get a little further away?

SHAWN:
No, we have to move now. We've got ten minutes to find a dolphin, feed it, then ride it. Plus, my dad being sick and not being able to chaperone, the fates are with us. It's the perfect storm.

They exit the bus.

GUS:
I don't want to miss the otters.

SHAWN:
No, we won't. Um, you brought your dad's camera, right?

HENRY confronts them as they turn around the front of the bus.

SHAWN:
You're not sick.

HENRY:
And you're not very thorough.

SHAWN:
How did you know?

HENRY:
Oh, maybe it's that snorkel hanging out of your backpack. What kind of undercover operation are you running here, kid? Plus... you left this behind.

HENRY pulls out a map of the aquarium grounds with SHAWN'S plan drawn on it. SHAWN makes a grab for it but HENRY pulls it out of his reach.

HENRY:
If you're gonna take time to create a deception, do it better.

SHAWN:
(takes map) Wait. Dad, I'm confused. You want me to lie to you?

HENRY:
(bends down) No. I want you to make it more of a challenge for me to catch you. Because I always will.

PRESENT DAY

EXT. PARKING LOT, DAY

GUS and SHAWN get out of the car. GUS is dressed in a somber suit and SHAWN is in his normal attire.

SHAWN:
Wait a minute. Something's wrong.

GUS:
What do you mean?

SHAWN:
I mean, this doesn't add up, Gus. (scoffs) There's not really a burglary ring at a gentlemen's finishing school, is there?

They start walking along the sidewalk.

GUS:
I'm sorry, Shawn. I made up a thing about the case. I need you to come down here to do me a favor.

SHAWN:
Well, you know what, this was a bad time. My dad just got a new fishing boat and insists on taking me out to kill innocent fish, and I can only avoid so many things at the same time. (notices the look on GUS' face) All right, what is it? (stops in front of him)

GUS:
It's a funeral.

SHAWN:
No. Absolutely not. You know I hate funerals. They're depressing. There's organ music, and six times out of ten, there's a snake in the casket.

GUS:
We'll just go really quick. I need someone to support me.

SHAWN:
All right. Who's it for?

GUS doesn't answer but continues walking.

INT. TENT-COVERED FUNERAL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS approach the tent. We see that it is for someone at the aquarium. There are mourners seated in rows and the casket is open.

SHAWN:
Would you please just tell me who died? I don't like all this secrecy, Gus. And what's with the aquatic theme? All this ocean society stuff? Did Jack Custo die?

GUS:
Jacques Cousteau died in 1995.

SHAWN:
Well, I don't think these people got the memo.

They sit down. SHAWN looks around for clues.

SHAWN:
Come on. Who died? Who was it? One of those guys? The boat guys? Huh? Was there some kind of accident?

GUS shushes him.

SHAWN:
Dude, I got it. It's the guy with the horn-rimmed glasses. (chuckles) If there was ever somebody with one foot in the grave...

The man in question leans forward in his seat on GUS' other side.

SHAWN:
Sorry. You know, the camera adds ten years.

GUS:
It's ten pounds.

SHAWN:
Shh. Just shh.

SHAWN notices all the pictures have a common denominator.

SHAWN:
Wait a minute. Is this a funeral for a sea lion?

GUS:
Yes. Yes, it is. And don't start, Shawn. Shabby's more than just a sea lion. He's a local hero and a heart-warming story.

SHAWN:
I can't believe you made me put on a dress shirt for something with flippers.

A MAN begins the eulogy.

MAN:
The ocean is a little smaller today with the loss of this inspirational guy.

SHAWN:
Is that Randy LaBayda? Dude, they got Randy LaBayda from Animal Planet.

GUS:
Shhh!

LaBAYDA:
If sea creatures could cry, their tears would cause their tears would cause the water level of all the oceans of the world to rise an alarming 21/2 inches. But Shabby would want us to rejoice. I was the last person to see him alive. And some people think I'm crazy to believe this, but as he returned to his home, Sweet Mother Ocean, I thought I actually saw him... wink at me.

SHAWN:
Just how famous was this sea lion?

GUS:
He's the big local story of the year. He was rescued by the aquarium people, Shawn. Remember? Floating on that loose raft? Then he died tragically after being released out into the wild.

LaBAYDA:
Come and grieve. (moves the flowers from in front of the coffin)

GUS:
It's a poignant story, and I need you to support me in my time of need.

GUS stands with other mourners to pay his respects.

SHAWN:
You have got to be kidding me. This is an open casket?

SHAWN stands behind GUS in the line at the casket.

GUS:
Shabby. (touches the sea lion) You almost made it. But you touched our hearts. And our souls. Be free swimming in the ocean of heaven where there are no natural predators.

SHAWN:
Good speech. (nudges GUS to move)

GUS:
Your turn.

SHAWN:
Are you kidding me? (clears throat) Shabby, buddy, you lived a full life, I guess. Uh, you probably balanced a beach ball on your nose at some point. Maybe honked a horn with your mouth. Barked the melody of "Grand Old Flag". Clearly, you... ate very well. (notices a wound) Oh, no.

GUS:
"Oh, no" what?

SHAWN:
I think this sea lion was murdered.

INT. TENT-COVERED FUNERAL, DAY

SHAWN and GUS go back to their seats.

GUS:
Why do you hate me?

SHAWN:
I don't hate you. I am telling you. There's something unnatural going on here. We should go back to the aquarium and check out Shabby's cage or something.

GUS:
He wasn't in an exhibit. He was in the ocean. He was released back into the wild three days ago.

A young WOMAN comes up behind them.

WOMAN:
Gentlemen, I'm gonna need to see you for a moment. (walks off)

They follow the WOMAN.

GUS:
Great. Now you got me kicked out of a funeral. Nice. Just add it to the list. Kicked out of Petsmart, kicked out of Santa's village, kicked out of the Salvation Army...

SHAWN:
Dishonorably discharged.

EXT. PARK, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are walking along the path with the WOMAN.

WOMAN:
Now what do you mean...

GUS:
I apologize. He's angry because I tricked him into coming. I'm a conservationist. I'm an annual pass holder at the aquarium. I'm a registered aqua-blogger with topic-starting privileges and level three thread management on the sea lion message boards.

WOMAN:
I want to know what you mean, "he was murdered. "

SHAWN:
I'm a psychic. I work with the SBPD. I also make my own saltwater taffy. Wait... Wait a minute. What? Why do you ask that?

WOMAN:
Because I have seen some suspicious things at that aquarium.

They watch as a man in a trench coat walks past.

WOMAN:
We can't talk here. Is there somewhere we can meet?

SHAWN:
Yes.

INT. PSYCH, DAY

GUS is dusting when SHAWN enters.

SHAWN:
Dude, what are you doing?

GUS:
Cleaning up.

SHAWN:
But why?

GUS:
This place is a mess, and it's not all the time that we have an attractive conservationist come by the office. Oh, and by the way, I call her.

SHAWN:
(takes off jacket) What do you mean, you call her? You can't call a person.

GUS:
Why not?

SHAWN:
Because I already called her at the funeral.

GUS:
You did not.

SHAWN:
She touched me, Gus.

GUS:
That's because you bumped into her.

SHAWN:
Doesn't matter. Contact is contact. It's the rule, buddy.

GUS:
(walks over and faces SHAWN) You know what? Get ready for battle.

SHAWN:
"Get ready for battle"? Come on.

GUS:
Yup.

SHAWN:
This is ridiculous. We can't go to battle over a girl we don't know. I'll back off.

GUS:
You'll back off? Why?

SHAWN:
Because this is silly. Look, you do your thing, you work it, and I'll stay out of the way.

GUS:
(points with duster) You think I can't get a girl on my own. Fine! I'll back off.

SHAWN:
I already backed off.

GUS:
Too bad.

The WOMAN enters the office.

WOMAN:
Backed off what?

Later, the WOMAN is sitting in one of the chairs drinking coffee from a mug. SHAWN and GUS are sitting close to her.

WOMAN:
Well, I was in charge of Shabby's rehabilitation, and a lot of unexplained things happened. First of all, they moved up the date of his release by six days.

GUS:
(takes her hand in his) And why did they do that?

WOMAN:
(pulls hand free) Well, um... Randy LaBayda.

SHAWN:
Randy LaBayda? From the funeral? And... And Pacific Ocean Aqua Patrol, yeah. (sits on the arm of her chair) I used to watch that show after wrestling practice in high school. I was the captain.

WOMAN:
(giggles) Yeah. Um, the aquarium did a personal appearance deal with him a couple months ago. Put him on the ads. Built a Randy LaBayda manta ray tank.

GUS:
What?

WOMAN:
And someone wanted him to be the one to release Shabby.

GUS:
And you didn't want that to happen?

WOMAN:
Well, no. It was too soon.

SHAWN:
Of course.

WOMAN:
LaBayda shanghaied the whole thing. It was supposed to be a quiet release with a local photographer. I got to the dock, the photographer had been canceled, and I wasn't even allowed on the boat. No aquarium staff whatsoever. And I never got to see him again.

SHAWN:
(puts an arm around her shoulder) That is so awful.

GUS slaps SHAWN'S hand and he stands up with a groan.

GUS:
(stands) So, uh... what happened out on the boat?

WOMAN:
No one knows. Everyone got back late, and a little upset. Then they locked up the ship's log in LaBayda's office at the aquarium.

SHAWN:
April, we're going to need to get into that office, so that I can feel things.

APRIL:
(stands) I can get you in.

SHAWN:
How soon?

APRIL:
Tonight.

EXT. AQUARIUM GROUNDS, NIGHT

APRIL is leading SHAWN and GUS along the aquarium wall.

GUS:
Are you wearing sweatpants?

SHAWN:
These are my "sneaking around" pants. Don't be jealous. I got you a matching pair.

GUS:
You're dressing up for her.

SHAWN:
Dressing up? Dude, I'm wearing sweats and this ridiculous lime green jacket.

GUS:
That's my lime green jacket, Shawn. And it's only for players.

SHAWN:
Okay, look, I backed off. You need to get over it.

APRIL stops at a spot along the wall.

APRIL:
Okay, this is it.

SHAWN:
What, is there, like, a hidden door in the rock wall?

APRIL:
(chuckles) No.

GUS:
You said you can get us in.

APRIL:
Yeah, I, uh... I can give you a boost. The electrified security fence is broken here. Oh, unless they fixed it.

SHAWN looks up to see a sign that reads "CAUTION High Voltage Electrified Fence".

GUS:
You don't work here?

APRIL:
Well, technically, no. I did, until Tuesday. (walks back to them) I was asking too many questions, and LaBayda's producer Tim had me canned. Which is why I asked for your help.

SHAWN:
You want us to scale a wall.

APRIL:
Is it too high?

GUS:
Oh, no, no. I could probably free jump it if the ground wasn't so wet.

SHAWN:
You could not.

GUS:
I could vault it.

SHAWN:
Where would you land?

APRIL:
Okay, listen. (goes back to the wall) There's a door right on the other side of this wall. It'll lead you straight towards LaBayda's office. The code is 1-8-4-2. If I'm wrong, you can just leave.

SHAWN:
If it doesn't work, we're probably going to jail.

APRIL:
Yeah. (bends over and cups hands) Who's first? Come on.

SHAWN shakes his head but GUS hurries over. SHAWN looks around before following.

INT. LABAYDA'S OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS make their way inside.

GUS:
See? She's legit.

SHAWN:
Legit? She just boosted us over a wall. She does have very impressive strength for a girl her size.

SHAWN looks into the large office. One wall has a painting of the man himself. Another has windows looking into the dolphin tank.

SHAWN:
Okay. (sing-song) Coolest office ever.

GUS:
(to dolphins) Hello!

SHAWN goes to the desk and searches the top drawer. GUS continues to wave at the dolphins. SHAWN spots a folder labeled "Shabby Release".

SHAWN:
What's this? (spots laptop) Wait a minute. Dude. He has two laptops. Why lock up this laptop over that one? (opens second laptop)

GUS comes over and the screen shows a map.

SHAWN:
Why does this have a GPS on it?

GUS:
It's the only software on this computer. And it's not picking up anything.

SHAWN sees the last set of coordinates before GUS closes it.

GUS:
Can we stop playing with this guy's computer and get to the ship's log, please?

SHAWN hands GUS the bound book then puts the laptop away.

SHAWN:
Yeah. Knock yourself out.

GUS reads the entries.

GUS:
This is all wrong. They were supposed to release Shabby near San Miguel Island.

SHAWN:
Okay.

SHAWN sees an article in the newspaper lying on the desk. "Feds Probe Rocinante Escape".

GUS:
Where they let him off is nowhere near close to there.

SHAWN:
Why would they do that?

They hear a door bang in the distance.

GUS:
We need to get out of here.

SHAWN puts the log back in the desk.

GUS:
(whispers to dolphins) Good-bye.

INT. AQUARIUM, HALL, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS head down the hall.

GUS:
Okay, let's get out of here.

SHAWN:
All right. (stops) Oh, wait, there's one more thing.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I have unfinished business here. And a date with destiny.

SHAWN tears off his sweatpants to reveal a bathing suit.

GUS:
No, no. You are not swimming with the dolphins.

SHAWN:
When are we gonna have another chance, Gus? Come on.

GUS:
I don't care, Shawn.

SHAWN:
I'm in, I'm on, I'm out. Hopefully, they have a harness, or a small saddle of some sort. I charged up my camera. (pulls out camera) You don't have to worry about the flash. It's all digital. Just keep on snapping.

GUS:
No, we are leaving, Shawn.

SHAWN:
I'm gonna ride that dolphin into modern history. I'm going up top.

GUS:
I'm staying here.

SHAWN:
(runs up ramp) You're missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime.

GUS:
Please.

SHAWN:
That dolphin is not going to ride itself.

We hear the door open and close. GUS sees the beam of a flashlight approaching.

GUS:
(whispers) Shawn! Shawn, get back here! (runs off)

EXT. DOLPHIN TANK, NIGHT

SHAWN walks along the dock running along the dolphin pool. He hears someone coming and ducks behind a pillar. The security guard walks along, casting his flashlight along the bins holding the fish. He swings it over by the pillar but SHAWN isn't there. He continues on his rounds and SHAWN emerges from one of the bins. SHAWN sees a cooler marked "Shabby". He opens it and lifts out a small fish. A dolphin appears and squeals at him.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Get out of here.

The dolphin keeps squealing.

SHAWN:
Not now. (looks around) Quiet! Pa does not love Fa.

The dolphin nods as it squeals.

SHAWN:
No, Pa does not love Fa!

The dolphin whistles.

SHAWN:
Now listen... I'm sorry.

The dolphin squeals.

SHAWN:
Stop doing that!

SHAWN'S just about to give in and throw the fish when GUS finds him.

GUS:
What the hell are you doing?

SHAWN:
Conducting an investigation, thank you very much.

GUS:
Then why do you smell like herring?

SHAWN:
Because this is an aquarium.

The dolphin squeals.

GUS:
You're feeding him! We're about to go to jail, and you're training dolphins?

SHAWN:
He insisted. I had no choice in the matter. I said "Pa does not love Fa".

The dolphin clicks and nods its head.

GUS:
And your hands are filthy. Do you realize how many germs you can transmit like that? Here, give me that. (grabs the fish)

SHAWN:
No.

GUS:
What? Give...

They fight over the fish and GUS wins.

GUS:
Here, dolphin.

SHAWN:
You just want to feed him yourself!

GUS:
I'm getting rid of the evidence. And yes, it's not fair that you, the person who cares less than me about marine wildlife gets to feed them, and I don't.

SHAWN:
Just throw it and let's get out of here.

GUS gets ready to throw the fish and a light is suddenly on them.

GUARD:
Don't make a move! Drop the fish, sir, and nobody gets hurt.

The dolphin swims away and SHAWN and GUS raise their hands.

INT. SBPD, VICK'S OFFICE, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are sitting in VICK'S office as she enters, dressed for a night out.

VICK:
Breaking and entering?

SHAWN:
It was really just entering. Climbing and entering. We had the code. Is that a backstage pass?

GUS:
And a Dolce jacket?

VICK:
I have third row center at Phil Collins tonight, and I get called back here because my department psychic wanted to break into an aquarium to feed some fish?

SHAWN:
That is not entirely true.

VICK:
Then why were you wearing swim trunks, carrying a "How to Ride a Dolphin" pamphlet?

SHAWN:
Chief, that's a long story. But the truth is we're on the trail of something. Something big.

GUS:
Something important.

SHAWN:
Slightly sexy.

JULIET enters with APRIL.

JULIET:
Chief. I think I can shed some light on this. This is April Macarthur.

APRIL:
I did it. Yeah, um, I couldn't let you guys take the fall for me.

VICK:
I'm sorry, miss. You broke into the Santa Barbara Aquarium?

APRIL:
Yeah, well, um, I led them to believe that I was still an employee at the aquarium. I got them the code for the alarm, and got them into the facility.

GUS:
She was also able to inexplicably lift us over a security wall.

APRIL:
Yeah.

JULIET:
Chief, she has good reason. She was actually acting heroically.

APRIL:
Thank you, Juliet.

JULIET:
No, thank you. And I like those earrings. (faces VICK) Chief, there may have been a murder. I can't believe poor Shabby is dead.

SHAWN:
You too, Jules?

JULIET:
Shawn, the Shabby-cam is my screensaver. We can all learn from him.

VICK:
Wait, who's Shabby?

SHAWN:
You don't want to know.

VICK:
I don't?

JULIET:
Yeah, probably not. Just know I am taking lead on this case. There is a crime at play, trust me. I will straighten out these aquarium people. They do not want to press charges at all. They like her. And so do I. We do not want to arrest this woman. We need to help her.

VICK:
Wow! Well, thank you for that endorsement, O'Hara. Now, I have to get back to the Bowl. Somebody needs to take me, because if I miss Against All Odds, then somebody is getting fired. (leaves)

INT. SBPD, HALL, NIGHT

LASSITER enters, putting on his jacket. He isn't wearing a tie.

LASSITER:
I missed it? They released you already?

SHAWN and GUS approach him after leaving the office.

SHAWN:
Lassie, it was all a big misunderstanding. We're working a case. Jules is helping out.

GUS:
We are solving a heinous crime.

LASSITER:
Heinous crime? Wait a minute. How heinous?

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS sit at the table while LASSITER stands facing them.

SHAWN:
Look, it's not a big deal. There may have been a murder. We've got it covered.

LASSITER:
I just need a name.

SHAWN:
I'd rather not.

LASSITER:
Listen, you guys don't know what I've been through these last couple weeks. (paces) I chased down a group of diamond smugglers.

SHAWN:
Congratulations.

LASSITER:
Not exactly. I chased them to an airport where a plane was waiting. Wait. (stops and points) What does "Rocinante" mean to you?

GUS:
A full-body Syrah.

SHAWN:
A gay couple from Lisbon.

LASSITER:
(paces) No, it was the name of their plane. Flew off into a lightning storm. I wanted to chase them, but apparently, our helicopters only fly when there's rainbows in the sky, so they got away clean, which means I'm officially jackass number one around here. I need a case. (steps over the back of the chair, sits and takes out notebook) Give me the victim's name.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Shabby.

LASSITER:
(writes) Shabby. Is that a street name?

GUS:
It's more of a given name.

LASSITER:
Last name?

GUS:
He doesn't have one.

LASSITER:
Do not play with me.

SHAWN:
Can I spell it?

LASSITER:
I don't care.

SHAWN:
T- H-E.

LASSITER:
(writes) T- H-E...

SHAWN:
S-E-A...

LASSITER:
(writes) S-E-A...

SHAWN:
L- I-O...

LASSITER writes it down and looks at SHAWN to finish.

SHAWN:
N.

LASSITER:
(reads what he wrote) Thesealion. What is that, French?

GUS:
Pinniped.

LASSITER:
Pinniped? Never heard of it. All right, description.

SHAWN tries to hide a smile at LASSITER'S gullibility.

GUS:
Black.

LASSITER:
Black. Height and weight?

GUS:
6... 700 pounds.

LASSITER:
Jeez, Louise.

SHAWN:
(clears throat) Listen, can you get a body exhumed?

LASSITER:
Of course, I can. As long as I'm in on the autopsy.

LASSITER leaves, excited. SHAWN and GUS watch him leave and then look at each other. SHAWN shrugs.

INT. SBPD, AUTOPSY, DAY

SHABBY is lying on the table. LASSITER, SHAWN and JULIET are on one side of the table with GUS and the CORONER on the other side.

LASSITER:
I'm gonna kill you, Spencer.

SHAWN:
I never told you that the victim wasn't a sea lion.

JULIET:
Carlton, I tried to keep you out of this.

SHAWN:
Uh, how long is this going to take?

CORONER:
I don't know. I've never examined one of these things before.

SHAWN:
Okay, that's fair. Are there any signs of, uh, I don't know, foul play?

CORONER:
Well, a couple things are odd. I found a strange, empty piercing.

LASSITER:
Maybe he started swimming with the wrong crowd. You didn't happen to find any tattoos, did you?

JULIET:
Carlton!

CORONER:
I found some flat reef coral in the fur.

GUS:
How's that possible?

LASSITER:
Yeah! Coral! In the ocean! Are you really asking that question?

GUS:
A sea lion is a precision animal. It knows how to swim around a reef without thrashing into it.

JULIET:
That's true.

CORONER:
And I found some synthetic fibers.

SHAWN:
Okay, what kind of fibers?

CORONER:
Monofilament line. The kind found in fishing nets.

LASSITER:
All right, I've heard enough. Close this thing up. Let's go, O'Hara. (heads for door)

SHAWN:
Lassie, you're not being very helpful right now.

LASSITER:
Really, well, let me see if I can close this case for you right now. Now, I'm no expert, but let me take a shot. You've got a sea lion, and you've got a net, and you've got the ocean. You put them all together... case closed.

LASSITER leaves and JULIET follows. SHAWN shakes his head, puzzled.

GUS:
What?

SHAWN:
I'm worried he might be right.

GUS:
Are you serious?

SHAWN:
I don't know, Gus. We definitely need to see that reef. And I know how we can get out there.

EXT. HENRY'S BOAT, DAY

SHAWN is sitting in the driver's seat, GUS on the seat to his left. HENRY is standing behind SHAWN, teaching him.

HENRY:
All right, that's it, that's it. Your hands are at 10:00 and 2:00. Down there, that's your trim tab. Over there, your heat gauge. That's your fish finder. GPS. Uses waypoints, just like in a car, when you find a place you like.

SHAWN:
(looks around) Look at that, you got a little microwave in there.

HENRY:
Shawn, please focus. (moves SHAWN'S head) Look forward. Do not become complacent just because it's water.

SHAWN:
Dad, we're still in the dock.

HENRY:
Look, Shawn, do you want to drive this thing or not?

SHAWN:
I never asked that. Isn't that right, Gus?

GUS:
Yeah, I'm gonna get in the middle of that.

SHAWN:
Man, I just wanted to come, see your new boat, go out onto the reef.

HENRY:
The reef? I'm not going out on the reef. That place is restricted waters.

SHAWN:
What if I told you it was for a case?

HENRY:
Well, that would make it worse.

GUS:
But what if he didn't?

SHAWN:
We won't tell anyone, okay? We totally promise. Plus, we'll totally solve a crime.

HENRY:
Shawn, would you please listen to me? I'm not going out onto the reef. That place is off-limits to people. I'm not gonna lose my boat, I'm not gonna lose my license to follow some stupid, lame-ass hunch of yours.

SHAWN:
You're really not going to budge on this?

HENRY:
What do you think? (goes to the stern of the boat)

GUS:
Told you.

SHAWN:
All right, all right, I do. I want to learn how to drive.

HENRY:
You know what, Shawn, hold up a second. I'm gonna grab my tackle box.

HENRY climbs out of the boat and onto the dock. SHAWN then drives away.

HENRY:
Shawn! Shawn!

GUS:
Shawn!

SHAWN:
Don't worry. It's cool.

GUS:
What are you doing?

HENRY:
Get back here!

GUS:
He's gonna come after us.

SHAWN:
Nah, he can't swim that fast. Besides, he wanted me to do this.

HENRY keeps yelling from the dock, following as much as he can.

HENRY:
Shawn!

GUS:
He wanted you to steal his boat?

SHAWN:
Yeah.

HENRY:
Get back here!

SHAWN:
He didn't want to be responsible for crossing over into restricted waters.

HENRY:
Shawn! Get back here!

SHAWN:
Didn't you get that with the whole "Shawn, Shawn, let me show you how to drive"?

GUS:
I think he wanted to show you how to drive.

SHAWN:
Yeah, so I could steal it later.

SHAWN takes the boat into the open ocean as the sun sets.

EXT. HENRY'S BOAT, NIGHT

SHAWN is trying to read a map.

SHAWN:
This thing is all numbers. It's very hard to read. Maybe it's upside down.

GUS:
First of all, Shawn, that's a Thomas Guide.

SHAWN:
Ah, thought it was a little land-heavy. But look, I think the reef is down here in the corner, A-7.

GUS:
Did you listen to anything your dad said? The map is the screen.

SHAWN:
Gus. Don't be exactly half of an 11-pound black forest ham. That's clearly the GPS.

GUS:
Exactly, it's latitude and longitude. You follow the degrees.

SHAWN:
Oh, yeah? Those numbers with the little quotation marks there?

GUS:
Yes.

SHAWN remembers the coordinates from LABAYDA'S second laptop.

SHAWN:
Dude, I think I know where it may have gone down. That laptop was probably tracking LaBayda's boat. Here, here, punch this in.

GUS leans forward to reach the GPS and SHAWN closes his eyes to clearly remember the numbers.

SHAWN:
34 degrees, zero, six, and then, uh, one of those little lines That I would use to, uh... To make a winking face in a text. No, go back, go back, go back. It should be the left eye that's winking, not the right. No, Gus, pretend the person doesn't even have a right eye. Like, no ocular socket whatsoever. It was sutured shut from birth.

GUS:
Shawn, I got it.

SHAWN:
Yes, that's it. Right there, that's good, okay. Now 50 degrees... Come on, buddy!

They watch their position in the GPS.

SHAWN:
Two degrees to the right. No, up. Two degrees up. What do those two little dots mean again?

GUS:
Kick out the lights.

SHAWN:
Oh, dude, we're getting close. We're, like, right on top of it.

GUS:
Kick out the lights.

SHAWN:
Why am I gonna kick out the lights?

GUS:
I think I see another boat out in the distance.

SHAWN:
Where's another boat?

GUS:
It doesn't matter where, Shawn. We're in restricted waters. I can't get arrested twice in the same week. You might have a few arrests in you, but I don't.

SHAWN:
Okay, fine.

SHAWN powers down the engine and turns off the lights. They then look out over the starboard side.

SHAWN:
Did you hear something?

GUS:
Like what?

SHAWN:
Like... voices.

Suddenly, bright spotlights come on from a boat very close by. They both scream and GUS grabs SHAWN to push him forward.

GUS:
Take him!

SHAWN:
What?

GUS:
I had this dream before, Shawn. Ever since we saw Dead Calm. You have to take one for the team.

SHAWN:
What are you talking about?

GUS:
Take one for the team!

SHAWN:
No one's gonna hurt us.

A MAN from the other boat hails them.

MAN:
Hey, guys. These are restricted waters. What the heck are you doing out here?

SHAWN:
Ahoy there! Uh, yes, right! Uh, my name is Shawn Spencer. This is my first mate Hummingbird Saltalamaccia.

GUS:
Hello!

SHAWN:
We were turned around. Discombobulated. We just now realized that we were in restricted waters.

GUS:
Just now. And we both have hepatitis.

SHAWN:
I also couldn't help but notice you are not the Coast Guard.

MAN:
No, no. We thought you were the Coast Guard, coming to tow us in.

SHAWN:
Us?

MAN:
Yeah.

SHAWN:
(laughs) No, no. But does that mean that they're coming? And if so, do you have an E.T.A.?

MAN:
No, no idea, we just... We've been, uh, drifting for about an hour. We stalled on our way to Monterey.

SHAWN:
Ah, old Mexico.

GUS:
Monterey, Mexico is 2,000 miles inland, Shawn.

MAN:
Up north. So, what are you guys doing out here?

SHAWN:
Oh, you know. Just, uh, hiding from sharks. You know, we heard that they can see you if your lights are on, so we kicked ours off.

MAN:
Uh, that's not how sharks work at all.

SHAWN:
Regular sharks. Of course. Right. But we heard there was an infestation of genetically-altered shark-like beasts here, in this area of the water. They can smell the light.

GUS:
They also type.

SHAWN:
True.

MAN:
What?

SHAWN:
Not well, but they're sharks, with fins, so it's still impressive. Oh, and, um, how long, did you say, before the Coast Guard gets here? They're not just right around the corner or anything are they?

SHAWN and GUS have returned to the marina.

SHAWN:
I'm telling you, Gus, there's something wrong with those guys.

GUS:
Did you want to stay out there and chat it up with them?

SHAWN:
No, but we may not be the only ones out there looking for the sea lion's killer.

They approach the dock and see HENRY with JULIET and LASSITER.

SHAWN:
Maybe he didn't want me to take the boat.

GUS:
I'm jumping out here.

SHAWN:
Okay, but you're gonna get wet.

GUS:
I can't believe this, Shawn. I'm gonna get arrested two times in one week.

SHAWN:
Okay, dad, we have to come up with a system for unspoken actions. I can't believe you called the cops.

HENRY:
I didn't call them, Shawn. They called me.

SHAWN:
Why?

LASSITER:
Coroner finished his inquiry.

JULIET:
He found a bullet inside the sea lion.

LASSITER:
Two .22 slugs, actually.

GUS:
He was shot?

LASSITER:
He was murdered.

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, NIGHT

LASSITER is questioning LABAYDA who has an owl on his shoulder.

LaBAYDA:
So, am I going to need a lawyer? 'Cause mine's on a boat off Cape Horn. It might take a while.

LASSITER:
Mr. LaBayda, would you remove that bird from your shoulder?

LaBAYDA:
(softly) Oh, this is an Australian hissing owl. And I have to do a show with him (checks watch) in about three hours. If I haven't bonded with him by then, he will spend the entire shoot crapping all over my Ed Hardy tee. Now, I would appreciate it if you would watch your tone, because this thing's Like a sponge and he can get really aggressive when things get tense.

JULIET enters the room.

JULIET:
Detective, telephone.

LASSITER:
I'm in the middle of something.

JULIET:
It's the FBI.

LASSITER:
Again? (turns around in seat) Would you tell them I didn't know they were smugglers until it was too late? And tell them if I had access to my own plane, I could follow the Rocinante into the storm!

LABAYDA makes a motion for LASSITER to quiet down.

JULIET:
Maybe you should tell them yourself.

LASSITER:
Right. (leaves)

JULIET approaches to look at the owl. APRIL stands outside the door and LABAYDA sees her.

LaBAYDA:
Didn't I have her fired? Oh, is that your source?

JULIET:
No. Mr. LaBayda, our source is the court. As in a court-sanctioned search we did of your office. We found a piece animal tracking software on your computer.

APRIL storms into the room.

APRIL:
We don't tag our animals, Randy! Once they're released into the wild, they're free.

JULIET:
Perhaps you'd like to explain.

The three have a staring contest.

LaBAYDA:
I need someone to take the bird.

>>>LATER>>>

LABAYDA is standing and pacing as he tells his story.

LaBAYDA:
All right. We were gonna track him. But it was such a great, heartwarming local story. It would have been a great national one. I mean, you can't blame me for wanting the people to know what happened to this special creature.

JULIET:
Yeah. Well, we need to know why you released him ten miles away from where you were supposed to.

LaBAYDA realizes there's no way out.

LaBAYDA:
I, uh... think I'd like to make my phone call now.

JULIET:
Yeah, I bet you would.

INT. LABAYDA'S OFFICE, NIGHT

An ASSISTANT is working late. He answers the phone.

ASSISTANT:
LaBayda's Sea Adventure.

CONTINUED, INTERCUT WITH -

- CUT TO:

INT. SBPD, CONFERENCE ROOM, DAY

LaBAYDA:
Burn the disks.

ASSISTANT:
Is this you, boss?

LaBAYDA:
Destroy the footage. Take a vacation in Mexico for at least a week, can you do that?

ASSISTANT:
I can't get to the footage right now, chief.

LaBAYDA:
Why not?

ASSISTANT:
Because your two hair analysts are reviewing it right now.

LaBAYDA:
I... I don't have a hair analyst. Who set that up? (realizes) Oh, crap. Get over there, now!

The ASSISTANT puts down the phone and runs from the room.

INT. MEDIA ROOM, NIGHT

SHAWN and GUS are watching the footage.

GUS:
Hair analyst? That worked?

SHAWN:
I've always dreamed of having one myself.

On-screen, LaBAYDA is dictating how he wants the shoot done.

LaBAYDA:
I need the sunset perfectly framing the silhouette. It has to be me and the wild. All right, let me just say, you see a single strand of my hair out of place, Let me know, we cut right then and there. And that includes chest hair. Timmy, you got me? You got me?

TIM:
Yeah, I got it.

LaBAYDA:
All right, here we go. All right, three... What?

The camera moves to the left and shows a large freighter in the background.

TIM:
Freighter, freighter.

LaBAYDA turns around and sees the freighter.

LaBAYDA:
What? No! No! Get out of the way! Get your big, polluting ass out of my shot! How many boats are there gonna be?

GUS fast forwards through the footage. LaBAYDA is now in a different spot.

TIM:
Okay. Perfect.

LaBAYDA:
I guess this'll just have to do. I don't like it. I want to go on record saying I don't like it.

SHAWN:
Hey, Gus, he's not a murderer. He's just an egomaniac. And for fairly good reason. His hair is spectacular.

On-screen, Shabby is released.

LaBAYDA:
Swim. Swim, my friend.

SHAWN:
He released Shabby in the wrong place to get a better shot!

GUS:
That means Shabby was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

LaBAYDA:
Arrivederci, my furry little Michael Phelps. Arrivederci.

SHAWN:
He didn't shoot him. He didn't do it.

GUS skips through the footage again.

LaBAYDA:
Yeah, pumas are pretty mean. I know one time, I ran into a puma...

SHAWN focuses on a boat that goes by in the background.

SHAWN:
Gus, look at that. That's the same boat we saw. It's the same guys. It was five days ago.

SHAWN remembers the excuse the MAN gave about being on their way to Monterey.

GUS:
They weren't on their way to Monterey.

SHAWN:
They were on their way to the reef. he reef, where Shabby went off the grid.

GUS:
Why would they be going out there at night?

There is a pounding on the door. GUS and SHAWN turn around.

TIM:
Guys? Out of there!

SHAWN:
Plan "A" or plan "B"?

GUS:
"B".

TIM:
(pounds on the door) Get out of there!

TIM crashes through the door to see GUS lying in his chair like he's dead and SHAWN standing there, hands over his mouth in shock.

SHAWN:
(lowers hands) Oh, my God, I killed him! (runs from the room screaming)

With TIM turned around and confused, GUS gets up and runs out.

EXT. MARINA, DAY

SHAWN and GUS stride down the dock.

GUS:
Shawn, you can't steal your dad's boat for a second time.

SHAWN:
Gus, you don't understand. My dad wants me to do this.

SHAWN makes to board the boat but HENRY is already there.

HENRY:
Do I, Shawn?

INT. SBPD, INTERROGATION, DAY

JULIET and APRIL are having lunch.

APRIL:
You were really good with him.

JULIET:
So were you. You really scared him. And the bird.

APRIL:
Listen, I don't know if this is the right time to ask, but what about Shawn?

JULIET:
What about him?

APRIL:
I don't know. Something... intriguing. You know, odd. It's refreshing. I was thinking of letting him know that I'm, uh, "available". You know, and all that. What do you think?

JULIET:
Well, I... don't know.

APRIL:
Is there a problem?

JULIET:
No, no. There's no problem. (sips her drink)

EXT. MARINA, DAY

SHAWN and GUS walk away from HENRY'S boat.

GUS:
Your dad's getting pretty good.

SHAWN:
Too good. I think he's been waiting in there since Thursday. It's pretty creepy. And mildly impressive.

SHAWN turns back to look at his dad and sees the mystery boat docked at another slip.

SHAWN:
Gus. Opportunity.

They go over to the other dock and hide behind a small storage shed and watch as the two men leave. SHAWN makes to go in the opposite direction when GUS grabs his arm.

GUS:
Dude, they're going that way. We gonna follow them or not?

SHAWN:
Uh, I'm definitely a "not" right now. (heads for the boat)

GUS:
(grabs SHAWN and pulls him back) But...

They shush each other.

GUS:
They might be coming back.

SHAWN:
They're walking in the opposite direction. I think this is our best opportunity.

GUS:
They're going to get help.

SHAWN:
They're unloading stuff. (looks in the distance and points) Barnacle Bill.

GUS:
What?

While GUS is distracted, SHAWN runs.

GUS:
Shawn! (chases SHAWN)

SHAWN stops with his foot on the gunwale.

SHAWN:
You wanna be Hawkeye or crow's nest?

GUS:
What do either of those mean?

SHAWN:
I don't know. I was hoping you did.

The two go aboard.

INT. BOAT, CABIN, DAY

They enter the cabin which is filled with electronic equipment.

SHAWN:
What is all this stuff?

GUS:
GPS, radar, sonar, electronic pulse sensors. High-tech stuff. That's how they knew we were in the water.

SHAWN:
(looks around) Whatever they were doing, they didn't wanna be found. (finds large hand-held light) And they were doing it at night. It's just a bunch of salvage equipment. Wait a minute. (finds a tracker tangled in twine) We need to get this thing off.

EXT. BOAT, DECK, DAY

They bring the tangled net out onto the deck where they have more room.

GUS:
What are we looking for?

SHAWN:
This thing, this thing, this thing! (shows GUS the tracker)

GUS:
Here, let me do it. I was a navy scout. (frees tracker) This is a satellite tracking tag.

SHAWN:
What's it for?

The tracker has LaBAYDA'S name on it.

GUS:
They use it for tagging animals. Training, research.

SHAWN remembers the coroner mentioning an empty piercing as well as the GPS program on LaBAYDA'S computer.

SHAWN:
LaBayda was tracking the sea lion.

SHAWN then sees boxes of ammunition in a storage pocket and remembers JULIET saying they found a bullet in Shabby: two .22 slugs. He points them out to GUS.

GUS:
They killed him, Shawn.

SHAWN:
But why?

GUS:
We should go. (starts to stand but sees the men coming) They're coming.

SHAWN:
Quick, jump in the water.

GUS:
They're gonna see us.

SHAWN:
Okay, hang from the anchor. Where is the anchor?

GUS:
That only works in cartoons.

SHAWN:
Is there a shark cage?

GUS:
How could that possibly be a good idea?

SHAWN:
I don't know! At least I'm coming up with some ideas.

SHAWN sees the hatch to the storage area under the deck.

MAN 2:
I'm telling you I saw someone on the boat. I swear.

MAN:
It's fine.

Just before the men arrive, we see the last bit of netting pulled in and the hatch closes.

MAN:
There's no one. Everything's fine.

MAN 2:
I saw something. I'm telling you.

INT. BOAT, HOLD, DAY

SHAWN and GUS are literally on top of each other in the tight space. They listen as the men talk overhead.

MAN: (off-screen)
You're paranoid, man. We're in the home stretch here. Let's go. Get going.

MAN 2: (off-screen)
No, I'm not. I'm checking the pull.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Dude, this is like Out of Sight, but super gay.

GUS:
Don't touch me, Shawn.

EXT. BOAT, DECK, DAY

MAN 2:
Wait, wait. You hear that?

MAN:
Hear what?

They pause to listen.

MAN 2:
All right, all right, I'm just nervous, man.

INT. BOAT, HOLD, DAY

SHAWN:
I see a flashlight.

SHAWN reaches for a flashlight and GUS smacks him. SHAWN turns on the light and searches the hold.

GUS:
Don't touch me, Shawn.

SHAWN sees a folder labelled "Flight Plan Rocinante" and remembers LASSITER telling them about the plane that flew off into a lightning storm.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Dude, I solved it.

GUS:
(whispers) Will you be quiet?

SHAWN:
(whispers) But I solved it!

GUS:
Be quiet!

MAN 2: (off-screen)
Wait, I heard it again. Didn't you hear that?

EXT. BOAT, DECK, DAY

MAN:
What do you hear? I hear birds.

MAN 2:
Listen, listen!

MAN:
Untie, push off. Please, we're going.

INT. BOAT, HOLD, DAY

They hear the engine start.

SHAWN:
(whispers) I think that's the engine.

GUS:
(whispers) I am gonna kill you, Shawn.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Ok, they would go. I'm gonna call for help.

GUS:
(whispers) No, he will hear you. He has eagle ears.

SHAWN:
(whispers) Eagle ears?

GUS:
(whispers) Yes.

SHAWN:
(whispers) How 'bout I send a text?

GUS:
(whispers) Mute your keys.

SHAWN:
(whispers) How do I do that?

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, DAY

JULIET is at her desk when she gets SHAWN'S text. She waves VICK over with a hiss.

JULIET:
Come here.

VICK:
Ok, what? What? What's so important?

JULIET:
I just got a text from Shawn Spencer.

VICK:
And what did it say?

JULIET:
It says that he solved the crime, and...

VICK:
And what?

JULIET:
He's trapped in the hull of a smuggler's boat going out to sea.

VICK:
What do we do with that?

JULIET:
(texting) "How... can... we... find... "

VICK:
Okay, now type the letter "u," Instead of "y-o-u. " And you don't need that punctuation. It's just faster.

JULIET:
Chief.

INT. BOAT, HOLD, NIGHT

SHAWN:
Dude, I really do feel so Clooney right now.

GUS:
I am not Jennifer Lopez.

SHAWN:
That was a compliment.

GUS:
How is that possibly a compliment?

SHAWN:
Did you see El Cantante? She was amazing.

GUS:
Shawn.

SHAWN:
(sighs) Shabby's transmitter. (reaches over GUS)

GUS:
Don't... (slaps at SHAWN)

SHAWN:
Hold on.

GUS:
Get off me, Shawn. Get off me.

SHAWN:
Got it. (turns on tracker)

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, NIGHT

JULIET:
(under breath) Come on. (out loud) Ooh! Ooh! I got another text!

VICK:
What does it say?

JULIET:
"Turn on LaBayda's laptop. "

VICK:
Uh... Someone, get it out of evidence!

INT. BOAT, HOLD, NIGHT

SHAWN:
(sighs) Now, all we do is wait. Gus, scratch my leg.

GUS does nothing.

SHAWN:
Just... Will you just scratch my leg?

GUS:
I'm not scratching...

SHAWN:
The elastic on my sock is...

GUS:
I'm not scratching your leg, Shawn.

INT. SBPD, BULLPEN, NIGHT

JULIET has opened LaBAYDA'S laptop and is looking at the tracking read-out.

VICK:
Can you give us a general location of the boat?

JULIET:
Well, it's a little bit problematic.

VICK:
Well, I have my sister on ready with the Coast Guard. Just give us the coordinates.

JULIET:
That's the problem. We have a very definitive location, it just doesn't seem to make any sense.

VICK:
How far out are they?

JULIET:
First Street and Main.

INT. BOAT, HOLD, NIGHT

SHAWN reads the text.

SHAWN:
Juliet wants me to check outside.

GUS:
You are not doing that.

SHAWN:
She says we may not be where we think we are. I trust her, Gus. I'm gonna do it.

GUS:
Shawn... Shawn!

SHAWN opens the hatch.

EXT. BOAT, DECK, NIGHT

SHAWN steps out onto the deck just as the boat enters a cannery.

SHAWN:
Uh, Gus? Change of plans. (ducks down)

INT. CANNERY, NIGHT

The two men have exited the pickup and are heading toward the boat.

MAN:
Let's do this quick, I got the diamonds, we lose the equipment as fast as we can...

SHAWN and GUS stand up.

MAN 2:
What the hell?

SHAWN:
Wait a second. This is not my boat. My bad! Gus, I told you, our boat is called Just Chillin'.

GUS:
Ah, yeah.

SHAWN:
Just Chillin'. Inexcusable. Uh, we're sorry, and we'll be on our way.

MAN:
Sorry you had to be here.

GUS:
Apology accepted.

MAN:
(cocks gun) Get down.

SHAWN sighs.

MAN:
Down!

SHAWN and GUS climb down using the ladder off the stern. When on the floor, the MAN directs them with the gun.

MAN:
Around this way. Come on. Towards the truck. Now what the hell's going on here?

The two scuttle sideways towards the truck with their hands up. They keep backing up as SHAWN talks.

SHAWN:
All right, guys, I'm just gonna be honest, 'cause that's usually the best policy, right? I'm a psychic.

MAN:
You're a psychic?

SHAWN:
Yeah. So I know you guys weren't really on your way to Monterey. And I know you weren't stranded. In fact, you were on a desperate search for the wreckage of the Rocaninante.

GUS:
That was nowhere near close.

MAN:
I really hate that you said that. Do we shoot them?

MAN 2:
I don't know yet.

SHAWN:
You don't know yet. Well, um, I'll tell you what else I know. You found your wreckage from a plane that everyone assumed escaped, but actually went down in restricted waters, which is why your booty was so tough to find.

MAN:
You a cop?

GUS:
We are not cops.

SHAWN:
No, but if I was a cop, I'd be a bad cop. That much I know. Not because I'm tough, or unscrupulous. Because of lateness. Just general tardiness.

MAN:
Would you stop moving? Get over here. What's the point of this?

SHAWN:
Unfortunately, a sweet sea lion named Shabby was innocently looking for a fish, or a squid, to eat...

MAN:
What the hell's the point of this?

SHAWN:
The point is, you saw the signal coming.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

EXT. BOAT, NIGHT

MAN 2 is looking at the GPS.

MAN 2:
I got a hot signal coming.

MAN:
What is it, a boat?

MAN 2:
No, could be a diver, though.

The men go onto the deck and use the spotlight on the water.

SHAWN: (v.o.)
You thought you'd been had, so...

The men shoot the gun into the general area where they thought the diver was.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

INT. CANNERY, NIGHT

SHAWN:
You fired into the water, thinking it was a diver, but no.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

EXT. BOAT, NIGHT

MAN:
I got it, whatever it was.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

INT. CANNERY, NIGHT

SHAWN:
You fired into the water, thinking it was a diver, but no. A sweet, innocent sea lion attached to a beeper by a television host on the sly, hoping to exploit his story for a comeback.

>>>FLASHBACK>>>

EXT. BOAT, NIGHT

SHAWN: (v.o.)
And when you tried to pull him out of the water, he managed to break free.

>>>END FLASHBACK>>>

INT. CANNERY, NIGHT

SHAWN:
Why? Because he was a winner. And a very strong swimmer.

GUS:
And a survivor.

SHAWN:
That's right. At least... at least for a couple of hours, he was.

MAN:
You're here because of a sea lion?

SHAWN:
I'm here for all the sea lions, Jack! And the fish and that stuff that looks like coral, but moves when you touch it. Gus, what am I talking about?

GUS:
Sea amanonees. (stammers) Sea anemonene...

SHAWN:
Don't do this to yourself.

MAN:
Sea anemones?

GUS:
Yes!

MAN:
Yeah, well it's too bad you can't do anything with all that information, isn't it, now?

SHAWN:
Yeah. Except that Shabby left a little something behind. (holds up blinking tracker) And I've been doing something I like to call stalling.

MAN 2 pulls the tracker from SHAWN'S hand.

SHAWN:
And Rutger Hauer calls "schtalling".

MAN:
Why?

GUS:
Because he's Dutch.

MAN:
No, why are you stalling?

SHAWN:
Because of that.

LASSITER and JULIET appear with other armed officers.

LASSITER:
Put it down! Don't move!

JULIET:
Drop it!

The two men are taken into custody and LASSITER holsters his weapon.

LASSITER:
Saving your ass again, Spencer?

SHAWN:
Lassie, (fist-bumps GUS) I believe you'll find that whatever your missing smugglers had is in that truck over there. Diamonds? Perhaps in the boat.

LASSITER:
What are you talking about?

SHAWN:
I'm helping you. I told you. It's a two-way street.

LASSITER:
Hold on. How did you...

SHAWN:
Little bit of this... (puts right hand to his head) and a whole lot of that.(left hand)

INT. PSYCH, DAY

SHAWN is spraying whipped cream into a drawer of GUS' desk. APRIL knocks on the door. She is wearing a shirt with the aquarium logo.

SHAWN:
Hey!

APRIL:
Hi.

SHAWN:
(stutters) The case is finished, but I still have to do a little, uh, paperwork. That's all I'm doing here. (puts down can) But look at you. Look at you!

APRIL:
Yeah, first day back. They even offered me LaBayda's office. I said "no".

SHAWN:
Really?

APRIL:
Mmm-hmm.

SHAWN:
That's the worst decision anyone's ever made.

APRIL:
Yeah. Listen, Shawn, um, I asked them for you, but they don't really allow people to ride dolphins. But we could arrange an interaction. That would be easy.

SHAWN:
Yeah. No, no, that's okay. I'm gonna wait. Wait until it's natural, organic, happens in the wild.

APRIL:
Uh, that's illegal.

SHAWN:
What if... What if I ride a whale? I mean, what if I do the same thing, but with a whale?

They both laugh.

APRIL:
That's a joke.

SHAWN:
Of course... Of course it is.

APRIL:
Okay, yeah, the, um... Well, listen, anything else I can do, please. You really are amazing.

SHAWN:
How about dinner? You and me?

APRIL:
Mmm.

SHAWN:
A very dark restaurant. I'll bring some candles, in case it's too dark. That's something I like to do.

APRIL:
Listen, Shawn, I, um... I really would love to.

SHAWN:
Sweet.

APRIL:
Uh, but I don't want to get in the way.

SHAWN:
Get in the way?

APRIL:
Yeah. I like her and I think you two will get there. So, thanks for everything. (heads for the door)

SHAWN:
Uh, what does that even mean?

APRIL:
(stops in doorway) Good luck, Shawn.

APRIL leaves and SHAWN stands there, confused.
